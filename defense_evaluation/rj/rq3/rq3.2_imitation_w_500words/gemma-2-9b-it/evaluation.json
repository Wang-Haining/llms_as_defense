            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "My neighborhood is a snapshot of Americana, full of single-family homes with a few split into doubles, clinging to the idea of the suburban dream.  My place has a little front yard and a tiny driveway, a throwback to a time when this kind of life was the epitome of success.  You can almost feel the dream fading, though.  The houses still stand, a testament to a time when hope was stronger, but the yards aren't kept up like they used to be, and there's a sense of resignation in the air. You still see kids playing, seemingly oblivious to the world's worries, and the 90-year-old school still stands, a symbol of a future that feels uncertain. Churches are scarce, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are bustling.

The karate school, once a hot spot, turned into a pharmacy when Hollywood stopped making \"Karate Kid\" movies. Apparently, pills are the new kicks. There's a small, old movie theater, showing classic films for a song, loved by the older crowd but ignored by the younger generation who crave the latest blockbusters.\n\nThe only expressway cuts through the town next door, a constant reminder of the world outside. There was a push to get an exit, championed by the young folks, but the older generation, fiercely protective of their town, convinced the city council to say no.

I think a cyborg with a country drawl and a log cabin would perfectly capture the essence of this place: a blend of the old and the new, clinging to tradition while facing an uncertain future.",
            "This neighborhood might not seem like much at first glance.

Students shuffle in, bleary-eyed and clutching coffee at 7 am, their arrival greeted by the frustrated honks of commuters who wish they'd stay home.  \n\nThe road leads to another residential street, where a park sits on one side and a rehabilitation center rests on the other.  The center boasts a cheerful porch with gently whirring ceiling fans, a stark contrast to the commotion outside. Children’s laughter echoes through the park, mixing with the buzzing of bees in the flower patches. Retired folks stroll with their dogs, eyeing the skateboarders with disapproval and offering polite nods to the teenage girls gossiping by the playground. \n\nNearby, a strip mall offers a slice of Americana.

She came from a town where the grocery store was just a stone's throw away, she'd never experienced anything like this before.  Overwhelmed by the sea of corn, I told her stories about growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood where I came from.\n\nFollow this two-lane country road, and you'll reach a quarry filled with water.

            "Alright, let me break down Portland for ya. See, \"weird\" isn't just a word here, it's practically the city motto.  You'll find it spray-painted on buildings that are also pizza joints, bars, music venues, and who knows what else.  Some folks think it's a throwback to the good ol' days, when Portland was more laid-back and affordable. Back when it was a breeding ground for unique subcultures.  But for others, it's an invitation - come on down to Portland, where being a little different is celebrated.  \n\nLook, even with all the Californians moving in and the fancy condos popping up, Portland still holds onto that weird vibe.  It's not about blind acceptance, it's about accepting things that don't quite fit the norm.  We've got our fair share of modern conveniences and problems, just like everywhere else. We buy our stuff from China, we have yoga studios and hipsters, we've got the whole nine yards.  Maybe \"weird\" means we just take it all a little less seriously.\n\nTake my neighborhood, for example.  You'll see colorful houses, gardens overflowing with flowers, herbs, and veggies, and these magical things called \"free boxes\" scattered around.  Think of them as sidewalk treasure chests, overflowing with clothes, books, and who knows what else. You never know what you'll find. It's all part of the Portland charm.\n\nBut hey, \"weird\" comes in all shapes and sizes. Some folks wouldn't touch a free box with a ten-foot pole. They're off doing goat yoga or cheering for the Timbers, our local soccer team.  Portland's a melting pot of people chasing their dreams, or at least dreaming about chasing them while enjoying a few too many beers.\n\nNow, let's be real, Portland has its struggles. We've got a drug problem, which often stems from deeper mental health issues.  The constant drizzle and gloomy skies don't help matters.  And homelessness is a huge issue, though no one seems to have a magic solution.  We've got social services, but they're stretched thin, just like everywhere else.  People here, like everywhere else, grapple with feelings of compassion and frustration when it comes to the homeless population.\n\nSo, yeah, Portland's weird.  But it's also real.  It's a city full of contradictions, full of people striving and struggling, just like everywhere else in the world.  But somehow, it all works.",
            "The mountains have always been there, standing tall in the north, witnessing every sunrise and sunset. Even when I'm lost in work or life, they remain a constant presence, steadfast and unmoved by the ups and downs of daily life.  On days when stress gets the best of me, they seem to call out to me. When I turn towards them, they offer a sense of peace and strength, helping me to face each day.  I first fell in love with these mountains when I moved here for college. While the university itself has its own beauty in its buildings, ponds, and trees, the mountains hold a special place in my heart.  The town itself is lovely, with charming cafes that fueled countless study sessions. A short walk or bus ride takes you to the downtown area, where faded brick buildings create a sense of history and bustle, reminding you of the nearby city. This vibrant energy doesn't last long, though, as you can quickly escape back to the peaceful small-town atmosphere by passing the library. This blend of contrasting vibes creates a unique charm, inviting exploration and making it easy to create lasting memories.  There are memories of walking past rusty swings in the park with friends after late-night study sessions, and running through the bustling downtown to catch a movie at the fancy theater thanks to a university discount. But there are also harder memories, as there are in every place. The ponds, in particular, can be places of both reflection and tears during those late-night existential crises, which I've had my fair share of. Watching turtles, ducks, and insects go about their lives, each playing a role, made me question my own purpose as I struggled to navigate life's complexities.  So, I walked past the pond, the park, and the quaint little houses that scream \"suburbia,\" until I reached a main street. As the sun rose, bathing the palm trees in its golden light, I realized I was walking north. And there they were, as always: the mountains, reaching towards the sky, a silent reminder of perseverance.",
            "Alright, so you're thinking about checking out Bensonhurst, Brooklyn? Finding it won't be a hassle, trust me. Public transit is a breeze in NYC, and Bensonhurst is right in the thick of it. It's got that classic urban vibe, no question. \n\nOne thing you'll notice right away is the abundance of Asian businesses. Over the past couple of decades, Bensonhurst has become a real melting pot of Asian cultures. You'll practically stumble upon an Asian-owned store every block you walk – supermarkets, laundromats, you name it. Locals swear by these places because the food is top-notch, prices are killer, and it's super convenient. I'm talking four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk from where I am!\n\nNow, Bensonhurst isn't just an Asian enclave, mind you. It's a mix of folks from all walks of life – immigrants, first- and second-generation Americans, the whole shebang.  While the Asian-owned businesses are definitely prominent, there's also a recently revamped park nearby that's a real gem. Think ten basketball courts, a huge field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground, even a water fountain for the little ones to splash around in.  And just like everywhere in NYC, the park's got a melting pot of people enjoying themselves. \n\nYou won't find any massive corporate towers here, just cozy co-op buildings, condos, and mostly two-family houses. The people are generally friendly, but they're known for being a bit loud. Think cars blasting music, revving engines in the morning – it's definitely not a quiet neighborhood.  \n\nIf you're planning a night-time visit, just be aware that while Bensonhurst is generally safe, you never know what you might encounter. There's always a chance you might run into someone looking for trouble, or even some petty theft.  I've personally had some run-ins with bullies in the past, but that was a while back.  Package theft is also a thing here, unfortunately.\n\nAnd one last thing – forget about the city's \"clean up after your dog\" rules. Dog waste is everywhere! Seriously, be prepared to dodge it on your way to the train or the supermarket. It's my biggest pet peeve in the entire neighborhood. Watch your step and keep those shoes clean!",
            "My neighborhood is a quirky place, tucked away on a steep hill with hardly any sidewalks. It's nicknamed the \"work out hill\" because it's a popular spot for joggers, but with no sidewalks you have to share the hilly road with them—a road that's not in the best shape and can be a bit of a hazard!\n\nThe neighborhood's got an almost patchwork look, with old, worn-down power lines strung up between houses. The constant rain and storms often knock branches down on them, leading to repairs that leave them looking patched up.  Everywhere you look, there are towering evergreen trees, but surprisingly, most people here despise them. They're constantly trying to chop them down because they block the view of the ocean. That's why so many houses are perched high on the hill, with massive glass second stories that reach for the horizon, craving that ocean vista.\n\nSunsets are breathtaking here, with the water glowing from below and the sky turning shades of orange. But most days are overcast, so the sunlight filters through a hazy veil. It's often damp and misty, with moss growing on everything—roofs, cars, even railings! I once left my car parked for a month and came back to find it covered in a thick layer of moss—took forever to scrub it off!\n\nThere aren't many kids around, but there's a school nearby. The neighborhood is mostly older folks, many of them retired. Instead of kids, it's all about dogs! They're everywhere, lounging in yards or racing down the street.  Be careful, though, because if you leave a door or window open, you might get an unexpected furry visitor!\n\nRabbits are another neighborhood fixture, much to the chagrin of gardeners who hate them for digging up their plants. My cats, however, delight in the chase and have thinned their ranks considerably. We have the usual assortment of birds: sparrows, hummingbirds, the occasional hawk or eagle, chased away by the neighborhood crows.\n\nThere aren't any shops nearby, but if you hike down to the waterfront, there are a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. The beach isn't much to write home about, but the rocks along the shore are fun for launching into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide, so you can easily see the other side even through the mist.",
            "My neighborhood's pretty chill, like a typical suburban spot in a small Tennessee town.  We're right in the middle of things, sandwiched between two state highways, which means there's more traffic than I'd prefer.  But other than that, it's a pretty quiet place. Folks don't move around too much, so I know most of the neighbors. They're all about the usual stuff - yard work, daily chores, that kind of thing. In the winter, we even have a hill in our street where the kids sled. Our house is on the corner, so we're practically the neighborhood watch. We know everyone's comings and goings, and we definitely notice any unfamiliar cars. Some folks like to walk for exercise or take their dogs for a stroll. The kids are always zooming around on their bikes, you know, the usual neighborhood scene.\n\nSince we work from home, we're pretty much always around. It's just me, my wife, and our two daughters, eleven and fourteen. Everyone else is used to seeing us come and go. We're a pretty active family, playing outside even when it's raining. We fire up the grill on our back deck sometimes, and that barbecue smell fills the whole neighborhood. Seems like someone's always mowing their lawn, too. From March to October, the sound of a lawnmower is practically a daily soundtrack. We've got tons of trees, which makes for nice shade, but in the fall, it's all about raking and burning leaves. I gotta say, I love that smell, it's like a signal that fall is officially here.  This year, though, we haven't had much of a winter, so it just feels like a really long fall. \n\nOur garage is at the back of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone's at the door. When I'm working on my truck or other projects in the garage, with the doors open, it feels like I'm more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays are pretty quiet around here, except for Thanksgiving and stuff like Mother's Day and Christmas.  Then, all the families have visitors, and there are cars everywhere. Overall, I really like living here. If it weren't for the traffic, it'd be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is smack-dab in the middle of the high desert, a world of dirt, dirt, and more dirt.  Unless you've lived here, it's hard to get the feeling of constantly seeing brown. When you *do* see a lawn, you know that person is splashing out big bucks on keeping it green. Back in the 90s when I first moved here, houses were spread out like stars in the night. Now, it's kind of the same, but there are a ton of new additions popping up. Honestly, it's getting more city-like every day, though I guess that's the story everywhere these days. \n\nThe people here are mostly friendly, just like any place, with its good parts and not-so-good parts. My neighborhood is full of nice older folks, which makes it feel pretty chill. As for shopping, it's mostly chains like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want something upscale, you gotta drive a bit. No Whole Foods or anything like that around here.\n\nConstruction seems to be the biggest industry, probably because there's still so much undeveloped land. It's kinda scary, though. I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and don't really want to go back. Speaking of construction, that's what my full-time job is - drywall and T-bar installation.\n\nWhat I love about where I live is the wildlife. People come to the high desert for all sorts of reasons, but the stark beauty and unique ecosystems are definitely a big draw. It's important for us humans to learn about and respect the animals that call this place home so we can all coexist peacefully. My family and I have adjusted really well. My three kids are obsessed with lizards and desert bugs; right now they're outside trying to catch some specimens.\n\nThere are some attractions around here, and Victorville is a pretty good spot for families looking for a different kind of experience. If you can time your visit with the San Bernardino County Fair, it'll be a blast. And if you're feeling adventurous, head over to nearby Wrightwood for some snow-covered mountain fun.  \n\nIf you're interested in the history and culture of the high desert, check out the Victor Valley Museum. They've got geological and paleontological stuff, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of Victorville.",
            "Let me tell you, my neighborhood is a bit different from most. While others probably talk about houses and yards, mine's more like a college campus. I live in a dorm, and my whole world revolves around that and the surrounding campus.  It's still a neighborhood, though, with its own vibe.\n\nWe've got our versions of houses: apartments, regular houses, and dorm buildings. The apartments are usually crammed with 2-4 people per room, with 4-6 rooms per floor.  Then there are the standalone houses, mostly for alumni, but they're pretty rare.  And of course, we have the dorms, which are basically havens for students.\n\nSpeaking of students, my neighborhood is a melting pot.  You've got people from all walks of life, all ages, all cultures.  \n\nWe've even got our own little shopping center with places to eat, the school store, and a grocery store. Need something? It's probably right here.  And for those who need to unwind, there's a park— kept clean and safe by everyone who calls this place home.\n\nIt's not your typical neighborhood, but it's mine, and I wouldn't trade it for the world.",
            "So, I've been living here for about a decade now, and thought I'd share some of my experiences.  When I first moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge with my family, I gotta admit, I was pretty bummed. I missed my old neighborhood and friends, and I even shed a few tears. But my parents wanted what was best for us - a better school, a safer place to live, you know, all the \"not ghetto\" stuff.  Over time, I adjusted and made new friends, even some enemies, but I never really got to know the neighbors well except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis for a while, since they lived right next door. They've become like family to me, and I'm really grateful for their presence in my life. \n\nI remember when my family went to Mr. Glen's wedding (they had a second one!). It was a blast, and it made me think about my own future wedding and giving my future wife the royal treatment. I even caught one of the little decorative straps Ms. Veda, his wife, threw during the ceremony, though sadly, not the bouquet! We danced the night away, and I had a great time hanging out with Marsharii, one of their daughters. Haven't seen her in a while, though. Hope she's doing well.\n\nThis neighborhood feels like a maze, but with GPS, I'm finally starting to explore it more. I've ventured out with my friends Kason and Curtis a few times, mostly hanging out at the local park and playing video games.  Those were good times. I also enjoy spending time in nature, it really calms me. Sometimes I bring some sticks from Home Depot to practice my balance, and even my bokken wooden sword for some practice. It's just fun to indulge in my passions.  There's also a basketball and tennis court, though I haven't played either in a while. It's nice to have them there if I ever feel like picking them up again. My dad and my best friend grew up playing tennis with Mr. Graves, and we had a blast, even though he pushed us hard!\n\nLooking back, there are tons of fun memories from this neighborhood, but these are the ones that stand out.  I know the best is yet to come!",
            "My digs are pretty close to the college, which is a major perk.  Mostly apartment buildings around here, but a few decent, not-too-expensive bars and eats to hang out at. One of the bars just got a name change – it's fancier now, but the drinks aren't drastically better.  Most folks here are either students or lower income, since the rent is pretty reasonable.  There are tons of kids 'cause there's an elementary school a hop, skip, and a jump away. I don't know my neighbors too well – I'm cool with that. They're a heavy weed-smokin' bunch, so the building management put an air freshener right outside their door.  We thought it was hilarious, kind of a passive-aggressive move, you know?  Most of the buildings around here are a little old-school, but might have been renovated inside. Down the street, there are these brand-spanking-new apartments, but I'm not a fan.  Cheaply built, but the rent is sky-high.  It's a total scam, but they can get away with it because they're near campus. There's this super cheap joint five minutes away that serves everything on paper plates and most stuff is microwaved. Across the street is a gas station, supposedly a terrible place to work. But the city put some cash into fixing up the road last summer.  Now there's a nice sidewalk, tons of grass, and the whole area looks a bit nicer. My building is tucked away under a canopy of trees – they chopped down a few, so there are stumps, but way more trees here than down the road. Behind my building is another line of trees, then another apartment complex.  I'm on 42nd, but right behind me is 43rd, and that's a rougher patch. The sidewalks are falling apart, buildings look shabby, and there are a lot of trees, probably to hide the shabbiness. Most of the crime in the area happens at an apartment complex on 43rd, but I can't blame them entirely. The buildings across the street from me have their share of crime and a revolving door of residents. But overall, I dig where I live. It's affordable, convenient, with everything I need close by.  The fact that the university is within walking distance and I have two bus stops nearby makes getting around a breeze.",
            "My neighborhood is a collection of charming duplexes arranged on a cul-de-sac, spaced out to resemble individual houses. They all share a distinctive yellow paint job, white porches, and green metal roofs. Most of the residents are friendly, often gathering at the end of driveways for casual chats while the neighborhood kids play. It's a heartwarming sense of community, a refreshing escape from the constant hum of technology that dominates modern life. It feels like stepping back in time, surrounded by fields, trees, blue skies, and fluffy white clouds.  Of course, living in the countryside comes with its quirks. This season, we've been under tornado warnings, and last night, we even heard the sirens!  I ended up seeking shelter in my bathtub, clutching my smallest dog, my purse, and a few pillows. My bigger dog wasn't too keen on the bathroom and stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The neighborhood was eerily quiet except for the sound of hail battering the ground. After the storm passed, the roads practically steamed due to the sudden temperature change. The hail melted instantly upon hitting the hot pavement. As the clouds parted, the sun emerged, and a double rainbow appeared. I grabbed my camera and snapped some pictures to share with my loved ones on Facebook. They were just as amazed as I was. The streets remained quiet for another hour before folks trickled back home. Then, life resumed its usual rhythm – moms and kids outside as dinner cooked.\n\nIt's a wonderful community for someone like me who recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I love the friendly Southern accents everyone speaks with. While all the duplexes look the same on the outside, they differ in size on the inside. Some are surprisingly small, which seems odd.  I enjoy walking through the large field behind my house and strolling down to the non-swimmable pond. I've even spotted deer and hear the booming chorus of a giant bullfrog in the mornings. It's a fantastic place to live, just forty minutes outside Charlotte. Each morning, the sound of roosters crowing from nearby farms greets me. It feels like living in a small, self-contained village. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm whose evening brays let us know he's around. I'm so lucky to have found this hidden gem of a neighborhood.",
            "So, I moved into this neighborhood when I was about to start eighth grade.  Making friends wasn't easy at first, but I eventually became close with a couple of guys—one two houses down and the other on my street. They've moved on since then, but the memories we shared stick with me. Most of the folks who were here when I first arrived are still around, which gives the place a familiar feel.  It's pretty typical suburban stuff—two-story houses everywhere, kids playing outside whenever the weather's decent, and a generally quiet vibe during the week.  \n\nI've never had any issues with anyone here. People generally keep to themselves, but they're always willing to lend a hand if you need it. I've ordered tons of stuff online and never had a package go missing. It's a safe and trustworthy neighborhood.\n\nThere's a park just a stone's throw from my house, overflowing with memories.  We used to play basketball, football, and baseball there with the other neighborhood kids. I even got clocked in the nose playing football once—definitely not my most glamorous moment. But the good times far outweigh the bad. Now, whenever I go to the park, it's to hang out with my cousin's kids. They're way younger than me and still love the swings and slides, which brings back a flood of nostalgia. Just thinking about that park takes me right back.\n\nThe neighborhood is super diverse, with tons of different cuisines within a short distance. You can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants all within a mile.  Of course, most folks nowadays just order in through apps like GrubHub and DoorDash.  The usual fast food chains are everywhere, but there are also plenty of pizza places sprinkled around, too.\n\nWe have all the necessities covered—dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, a Jewel-Osco grocery store (a Midwest staple), and even an Indian-owned store for all your homemade curry needs.\n\nOverall, I'm pretty lucky to call this place home. Reading about all the neighborly drama going on elsewhere makes me appreciate the peace and security I have here.",
            "My town, Johnston, is pretty typical for South Carolina.  It's small and quiet, but it plays a big role in the state's agriculture scene. You can't miss their claim to fame: \"Peach Capital of the World\" proudly sits on the town sign. It's basically one big farm, either bursting with peach trees or grazing cattle. Houses are spread out, mostly two-story affairs with metal roofs or gray shingles to beat the summer heat. They're often tucked back from the road, leaving front yards for animals and crops. In the town center, a single stoplight controls traffic at the four-way intersection, where you'll find all the town's shops. \n\nFor a quick bite, you've got Hong Kong, a family-run Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican, or Gary's, a small burger joint. Sadly, the pizza place closed down recently. There's Maxwell and Halford Drug, a tiny pharmacy famous for its Cherry Coke. Then there's the IGA, a smaller, pricier grocery store.  Even though it's the only one in town, most people head to a Walmart in the nearby town of Batesburg-Leesville for their big grocery hauls. The real star, though, is Dollar General. It's packed from opening to closing with folks grabbing everyday essentials. \n\nPossibilities Furniture & More, run by a friendly local, is a small furniture store with delivery service. Next door is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet groomer offering daycare, boarding, and all the pampering a pet could want. The doctor's office and the vet are a little outside the main drag, but they're well-equipped to take care of the town's residents.  Johnston Elementary School is the only one in town; after fifth grade, kids head to the neighboring town for middle and high school.\n\nDon't expect any parks or amusement spots here. They are, however, working on a small recreational area to give families more options for fun and attract new residents.  It's definitely a quiet town, so much so that you could easily drive through without even noticing.",
            "My first introduction to this place came through a podcast about missing persons, which was a bit of a shock. I couldn't believe it, considering apartments in the area were going for over a thousand dollars a month.  None of my friends had heard anything about it either. Maybe it's the struggle that keeps things under wraps. I know some of my friends have tough nights, crying themselves to sleep because things are so expensive. But we've learned how to be resourceful over time.  We've come to appreciate the musty scent of flea market finds and secondhand clothes. You learn to prioritize practicality over things that don't really matter when you're an adult. It's like the smell of adulthood itself: dusty magazines piled on a closed piano, lingering on your leather jacket even after you wash it.  Luckily, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. You can start at one end and hit two charity thrift shops, a library, a rare book store, and even a curiosity shop. Downtown is bustling with cars and people every morning, but inside the thrift stores, it's always quiet. No matter how much noise is outside, the stores remain peaceful sanctuaries. It's the perfect place to lose yourself for an afternoon. Every year, the city seems to get even more crowded. Cars and people swarm the streets, a sign of its rapid development. They call it a developing city, headquartered by one of the world's largest e-commerce and delivery empires. It's still growing, still figuring things out. It reminds me of New York City in its early days - everyone focused on their own goals, not really asking much from anyone else.  You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and nobody bats an eye. It's different from the South, where a little concern is seen as genuine care. Here, people mind their own business. You can keep your distance as long as you want, and the city just keeps rolling on like the waves on the beach. It's a vibrant place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur singers upstairs, there's always something happening.  In a way, we have less of an apartment building full of strangers and more of a community of friends. We come together for birthdays, funerals, and whatever else life throws our way, always there to support each other. I feel lucky to be here. I like most of my neighbors, and they're pretty good to me. I try to be considerate, cleaning up after myself and sharing food, and they do the same. We help each other out with mail and other errands. It's nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my company as much as I do theirs. I live in this massive, impersonal modern complex, but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I haven't completely messed up my life.",
            "So, where I live is basically your average, run-of-the-mill suburb. You know, the kind where everyone's got a perfectly manicured lawn and the homeowner's association is breathing down your neck about every little thing.  Every house looks pretty much the same: little patch of grass, some fancy rocks, a short driveway, maybe a tree or two, and a two-car garage.  You drive down the street and it's like a brand new road, no potholes or bumps in sight.  Most houses are single-story, but sometimes you'll see a two-story thrown in for good measure.\n\nSpeaking of different, our mailboxes are a bit weird. Instead of individual ones by each house, they're all clustered together at the end of the street like in an apartment building. You gotta use a key to get to your own box, and there are giant lockers for packages too.  You can thank the HOA for that little dose of uniformity.\n\n[REWRITE]",
            "I call a small Midwestern town outside a big city home. My area, on the east side, is the less affluent part of town. You'll see a lot of rented houses and folks earning lower incomes here. But it's not a bad place to be.  My neighbors are all friendly folks who wave hello when I walk by. Crime isn't super high, though it's a bit higher than in other parts of town. We've had a few shootings and even a homicide within a couple blocks of my house over the past ten years. The family next door lost their son in a shooting outside a bar last year, which was a real tragedy. Luckily, we haven't been directly affected by crime, just the occasional item snatched from our porch if we forget to bring it inside.\n\nThis town, like many across the country, has been hit hard by the opioid epidemic. We've lost people to fentanyl overdoses, it's been tough.  But there are resources here to help, like addiction recovery centers and Narcan training for families.\n\nDespite the challenges, our town has a lot going for it. My son's elementary school is fantastic – the principal, teachers, and support staff are all amazing.  He has special needs, but he's never been bullied there because the school has such a positive atmosphere.  He loves it! We have a vibrant PTO that organizes lots of events to get families involved and support learning. Since over 20% of our town lives below the poverty line, the school provides free breakfast and lunch for every student, so no kid goes hungry. No one is made to feel less than because they can't afford things – school fees, supplies, and field trips are all very reasonable.\n\nThe city council has been working hard to spruce things up, repaving roads, landscaping, and fixing up parks. Most of these improvements have been focused on the downtown and west side, where the shops are and most people drive through. The east side, where I live, seems to get left behind, which isn't fair, but hey.\n\nOverall, I'm happy living here. People are friendly, the schools are great, we have enough shopping options (both big chains and local businesses) to get by, and our house might not be worth much, but it's comfy and does the job. We've lived here for over 16 years, and we can't imagine being anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is a melting pot of culture, built on a hill with buildings that whisper stories of the past. I live in a seven-story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and just down the street is a cool arcade bar that pulls in all sorts of folks on warm summer evenings. You'll often see a line snaking down the block on weekends, especially in June and July. A few blocks up, you'll find the nearest city park, surprisingly spacious for this urban area.  Around the park is a concrete wall with tall stairs built in. During the harsh winter months, homeless folks set up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and those wide steps, seeking warmth against the biting cold and frequent downpours. Clustering together in the heart of town, rather than out in the open, helps them stay warmer. Plus, they're within easy reach of the only family center for miles, where they can shower and find some comfort.\n\nBut what I truly love about this city isn't just the history and architecture that grace its hills, leading down to the ocean. It's the people. You see, Hilltop has a past, a notorious one, as the West Coast's most violent neighborhood. Even decades later, stories circulate about federal agents and the DEA trying to clean up the streets. Those stories echo through generations, reaching newcomers like me. Despite its rough reputation, the residents work hard to keep it clean and cared for. They still have a strong sense of community, a fierce loyalty.  \n\nThere's a saying, \"If you're white, don't walk around Hilltop after dark.\"  I think it's a relic of the past, a leftover from a time of fear and prejudice, perhaps even a bit of self-preservation. Maybe it's because I'm dark enough to blend in, or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of their own, someone who understands the underlying tensions that still linger.  We're all reminded of how racism and assumptions can blind people to the truth, even in a city that prides itself on being a melting pot. But one thing is certain: no matter where I go, Hilltop will always feel like home. \n\nWalking its streets at night, encountering people who offer me a jacket before a wallet, makes me feel alive. It's a place where the laundromat owner stays open late so I can charge my phone when trapped by the rain. It's a place where I've huddled unseen against shop fronts on the bleakest nights, only to have someone stop, meet my eyes, hand me $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I live in a small town in rural Michigan, where farmland blends into quaint tourist spots. You won't find any big city chains like malls, Walmart, or even an Applebee's here. Everything requires a drive to get to.  Despite the lack of bustling city life, I live in a breathtaking place surrounded by water. Both Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix border my town, offering beaches practically everywhere you go.\n\nMy neighborhood embodies the classic small-town feel. Houses aren't crammed together, and they're not cookie-cutter designs. They're older homes, some modernized, others retaining their original charm. Most have full basements visible from the street, and you'll find a mix of architectural styles and colors. Yards are common, with trampolines, playsets, gardens, and even fences for animals. \n\nIt's a neighborhood of hardworking folks – families raising children or enjoying life after raising them. Kids are constantly running around, and you'll see people walking dogs, biking, and rollerblading. Neighbors know each other, and a sense of community prevails. You'll see someone grilling and wave back, or smile at a dog walker passing by. Lawns are well-maintained, with no piles of leaves or overgrown greenery. \n\nWhile not picture-perfect, it's a place where you can picture raising a family. It's quiet, peaceful, and safe.  It's not about stunning aesthetics, but about providing a sense of belonging and security. \n\nWithin walking distance, you'll find the county sheriff's department, jail, health department, and recycling center, all serving the community. Nearby, baseball and softball fields echo with the sounds of games, and our small town airport provides a constant soundtrack of planes taking off and landing. You can even walk to the local ice cream parlor, or if you're feeling adventurous, make it downtown. My kids can easily bike to the park, just eight blocks away. \n\nIt's a truly great place to call home."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "My neighborhood's a real melting pot, crammed into this big city.  You've got houses scattered here and there, kinda randomly, between shops and offices and all sorts of places to eat and have fun.  There's never a shortage of new restaurants popping up, and you can find everything from massive chain stores to cute little boutiques. These boutiques aren't just in malls, either - they're all over the place, bringing a bit of buzz to neighborhoods that'd otherwise be pretty quiet.\n\nWe've got a couple of parks nearby, and it's always cool to see families hanging out there with their kids. The people themselves are super diverse, too.  One little area has a big LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a bunch of folks who came from the former Soviet Union.\n\nNot too far outside my neighborhood, you've got all sorts of other cultures hanging out in their own little pockets - Korean Town, China Town, Little Armenia, and more. But even though these areas are close by, getting around can be a nightmare. Traffic is insane, especially during rush hour - ten miles can take you two hours!  Most people here drive everywhere, so walking isn't really an option.\n\nThe city's HUGE, and we're constantly adding more apartment buildings, which is great for some people but kinda stressful for those of us worried about even more traffic.  \n\nBut hey, not everyone wants to live in a massive apartment building. There are tons of houses of all sizes scattered around, plus smaller apartment complexes and condos. You've got single-family homes, duplexes - all sorts of options.  \n\nMy neighborhood's got people of all ages, but it's not really the tight-knit community it used to be.  I remember playing outside with my neighbor and a few other kids when I was younger, but these days, most of my neighbors are strangers.",
            "My neighborhood is a snapshot of Americana, full of single-family homes with a few split into doubles, clinging to the idea of the suburban dream.  My place has a little front yard and a tiny driveway, a throwback to a time when this kind of life was the epitome of success.  You can almost feel the dream fading, though.  The houses still stand, a testament to a time when hope was stronger, but the yards aren't kept up like they used to be, and there's a sense of resignation in the air. You still see kids playing, seemingly oblivious to the world's worries, and the 90-year-old school still stands, a symbol of a future that feels uncertain. Churches are scarce, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are bustling.  It's a mix of old and new, with each house wearing its history differently.\n\nThere's a big supermarket owned by a Yemenite family, probably the only Arab family around, surrounded by mostly African American neighbors.  The streets are wide, perfect for kids kicking a football, only pausing to let cars pass. Most folks here have roots that run deep, families who've been around for generations, sharing stories of a time when everyone knew everyone. Even the businesses have stories.  The karate school, once a hot spot, turned into a pharmacy when Hollywood stopped making \"Karate Kid\" movies. Apparently, pills are the new kicks. There's a small, old movie theater, showing classic films for a song, loved by the older crowd but ignored by the younger generation who crave the latest blockbusters.\n\nThe only expressway cuts through the town next door, a constant reminder of the world outside. There was a push to get an exit, championed by the young folks, but the older generation, fiercely protective of their town, convinced the city council to say no. Now, they're building a new high school, but the question of a mascot is a hot topic.  I think a cyborg with a country drawl and a log cabin would perfectly capture the essence of this place: a blend of the old and the new, clinging to tradition while facing an uncertain future.",
            "This neighborhood might not seem like much at first glance. Tucked behind a shopping strip in a residential area, it doesn't scream \"desirable living.\"  But if you venture past the old, forgotten Whole Foods and the hotels that only buzz with life during summer reunions, you'll discover a thriving community hidden in plain sight. \n\nYou'll find a cluster of apartment complexes lined up like carefully disassembled Russian nesting dolls, each nestled beside the other. Some complexes have a shady past, making headlines for less-than-savory dealings, but let’s just say appearances can be deceiving. Just a little further down the road, you'll stumble upon a different world, a secret known only to a select few.  \n\nAcross from these complexes sits a quiet community college campus, its sleepy buildings watching over the road. Students shuffle in, bleary-eyed and clutching coffee at 7 am, their arrival greeted by the frustrated honks of commuters who wish they'd stay home.  \n\nThe road leads to another residential street, where a park sits on one side and a rehabilitation center rests on the other.  The center boasts a cheerful porch with gently whirring ceiling fans, a stark contrast to the commotion outside. Children’s laughter echoes through the park, mixing with the buzzing of bees in the flower patches. Retired folks stroll with their dogs, eyeing the skateboarders with disapproval and offering polite nods to the teenage girls gossiping by the playground. \n\nNearby, a strip mall offers a slice of Americana. A sushi place with cheap eats and a constant flow of customers sits next to a swimming supply store and a nail salon.  You could get your pool ready for summer, get your nails done, and enjoy some hibachi chicken, all in one stop.  \n\nAnd there's the frozen yogurt shop, the kind where you build your own concoction, perfect for the teens who hang out in the park, their faces smeared with toppings and their lungs filled with vape smoke, convinced they are the coolest kids around. \n\nThis neighborhood is a snapshot of sleepy Southern life, where change moves at a leisurely pace, and time itself seems to slow down.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove past endless cornfields stretching as far as the eye could see. I knew she'd be stunned by the vast emptiness of the landscape. She came from a town where the grocery store was just a stone's throw away, she'd never experienced anything like this before.  Overwhelmed by the sea of corn, I told her stories about growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood where I came from.\n\nFollow this two-lane country road, and you'll reach a quarry filled with water. Just past it lies the small development where I live.  The houses are mostly brick and stucco, each sitting on at least half an acre of land that everyone takes pride in keeping pristine. Springtime bursts with color from the flowers planted each year, mingling with the changing hues of the midwestern trees throughout the seasons. You'll see rows of high-end Mercedes-Benz cars gleaming in the sun after a good wash, parked in each driveway.\n\nAs you continue down the road towards my grey stucco house, you'll see my Korean neighbor, always with a friendly smile, tending to his lawn. He spends his entire day mowing, his singing echoing over the hum of the mower. Everyone finds it amusing, but he's truly a kind and unique individual with an interesting past. He used to be a doctor, and now you'll often find him blending into the scenery with his John Deere Zero Turn mower. \n\nFinally, you'll arrive at my home. In the side yard, geese waddle around, chased by our terrier. Behind the house, a small stream flows into the quarry, where you can hear bullfrogs croaking, the gentle rush of water, and the occasional \"moo\" from nearby farms.  Cross the handmade wooden bridge, and you'll find a peaceful oasis filled with native trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This is where I spent most of my childhood, building tree forts, \"hunting\" (mostly chasing) animals, and always finding an adventurous friend to play with. \n\nWinters in our town can be harsh, but there's a beauty to them. The lush green yard transforms into a stark wilderness. The trees, once adorned with vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers, become bare skeletons of bark. When snow falls, it's like magic, transforming everything into a winter wonderland.  My yard is filled with snow angels made by my sister and towering snowmen. We fought constantly as kids, using snowballs as our weapons. We'd build massive igloo-like forts, armed with branches, ready for battle.  Our winter wonderland was our escape, a place where we could be just carefree kids.",
            "Alright, let me break down Portland for ya. See, \"weird\" isn't just a word here, it's practically the city motto.  You'll find it spray-painted on buildings that are also pizza joints, bars, music venues, and who knows what else.  Some folks think it's a throwback to the good ol' days, when Portland was more laid-back and affordable. Back when it was a breeding ground for unique subcultures.  But for others, it's an invitation - come on down to Portland, where being a little different is celebrated.  \n\nLook, even with all the Californians moving in and the fancy condos popping up, Portland still holds onto that weird vibe.  It's not about blind acceptance, it's about accepting things that don't quite fit the norm.  We've got our fair share of modern conveniences and problems, just like everywhere else. We buy our stuff from China, we have yoga studios and hipsters, we've got the whole nine yards.  Maybe \"weird\" means we just take it all a little less seriously.\n\nTake my neighborhood, for example.  You'll see colorful houses, gardens overflowing with flowers, herbs, and veggies, and these magical things called \"free boxes\" scattered around.  Think of them as sidewalk treasure chests, overflowing with clothes, books, and who knows what else. You never know what you'll find. It's all part of the Portland charm.\n\nBut hey, \"weird\" comes in all shapes and sizes. Some folks wouldn't touch a free box with a ten-foot pole. They're off doing goat yoga or cheering for the Timbers, our local soccer team.  Portland's a melting pot of people chasing their dreams, or at least dreaming about chasing them while enjoying a few too many beers.\n\nNow, let's be real, Portland has its struggles. We've got a drug problem, which often stems from deeper mental health issues.  The constant drizzle and gloomy skies don't help matters.  And homelessness is a huge issue, though no one seems to have a magic solution.  We've got social services, but they're stretched thin, just like everywhere else.  People here, like everywhere else, grapple with feelings of compassion and frustration when it comes to the homeless population.\n\nSo, yeah, Portland's weird.  But it's also real.  It's a city full of contradictions, full of people striving and struggling, just like everywhere else in the world.  But somehow, it all works.",
            "The mountains have always been there, standing tall in the north, witnessing every sunrise and sunset. Even when I'm lost in work or life, they remain a constant presence, steadfast and unmoved by the ups and downs of daily life.  On days when stress gets the best of me, they seem to call out to me. When I turn towards them, they offer a sense of peace and strength, helping me to face each day.  I first fell in love with these mountains when I moved here for college. While the university itself has its own beauty in its buildings, ponds, and trees, the mountains hold a special place in my heart.  The town itself is lovely, with charming cafes that fueled countless study sessions. A short walk or bus ride takes you to the downtown area, where faded brick buildings create a sense of history and bustle, reminding you of the nearby city. This vibrant energy doesn't last long, though, as you can quickly escape back to the peaceful small-town atmosphere by passing the library. This blend of contrasting vibes creates a unique charm, inviting exploration and making it easy to create lasting memories.  There are memories of walking past rusty swings in the park with friends after late-night study sessions, and running through the bustling downtown to catch a movie at the fancy theater thanks to a university discount. But there are also harder memories, as there are in every place. The ponds, in particular, can be places of both reflection and tears during those late-night existential crises, which I've had my fair share of. Watching turtles, ducks, and insects go about their lives, each playing a role, made me question my own purpose as I struggled to navigate life's complexities.  So, I walked past the pond, the park, and the quaint little houses that scream \"suburbia,\" until I reached a main street. As the sun rose, bathing the palm trees in its golden light, I realized I was walking north. And there they were, as always: the mountains, reaching towards the sky, a silent reminder of perseverance.",
            "Alright, so you're thinking about checking out Bensonhurst, Brooklyn? Finding it won't be a hassle, trust me. Public transit is a breeze in NYC, and Bensonhurst is right in the thick of it. It's got that classic urban vibe, no question. \n\nOne thing you'll notice right away is the abundance of Asian businesses. Over the past couple of decades, Bensonhurst has become a real melting pot of Asian cultures. You'll practically stumble upon an Asian-owned store every block you walk – supermarkets, laundromats, you name it. Locals swear by these places because the food is top-notch, prices are killer, and it's super convenient. I'm talking four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk from where I am!\n\nNow, Bensonhurst isn't just an Asian enclave, mind you. It's a mix of folks from all walks of life – immigrants, first- and second-generation Americans, the whole shebang.  While the Asian-owned businesses are definitely prominent, there's also a recently revamped park nearby that's a real gem. Think ten basketball courts, a huge field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground, even a water fountain for the little ones to splash around in.  And just like everywhere in NYC, the park's got a melting pot of people enjoying themselves. \n\nYou won't find any massive corporate towers here, just cozy co-op buildings, condos, and mostly two-family houses. The people are generally friendly, but they're known for being a bit loud. Think cars blasting music, revving engines in the morning – it's definitely not a quiet neighborhood.  \n\nIf you're planning a night-time visit, just be aware that while Bensonhurst is generally safe, you never know what you might encounter. There's always a chance you might run into someone looking for trouble, or even some petty theft.  I've personally had some run-ins with bullies in the past, but that was a while back.  Package theft is also a thing here, unfortunately.\n\nAnd one last thing – forget about the city's \"clean up after your dog\" rules. Dog waste is everywhere! Seriously, be prepared to dodge it on your way to the train or the supermarket. It's my biggest pet peeve in the entire neighborhood. Watch your step and keep those shoes clean!",
            "My neighborhood is a quirky place, tucked away on a steep hill with hardly any sidewalks. It's nicknamed the \"work out hill\" because it's a popular spot for joggers, but with no sidewalks you have to share the hilly road with them—a road that's not in the best shape and can be a bit of a hazard!\n\nThe neighborhood's got an almost patchwork look, with old, worn-down power lines strung up between houses. The constant rain and storms often knock branches down on them, leading to repairs that leave them looking patched up.  Everywhere you look, there are towering evergreen trees, but surprisingly, most people here despise them. They're constantly trying to chop them down because they block the view of the ocean. That's why so many houses are perched high on the hill, with massive glass second stories that reach for the horizon, craving that ocean vista.\n\nSunsets are breathtaking here, with the water glowing from below and the sky turning shades of orange. But most days are overcast, so the sunlight filters through a hazy veil. It's often damp and misty, with moss growing on everything—roofs, cars, even railings! I once left my car parked for a month and came back to find it covered in a thick layer of moss—took forever to scrub it off!\n\nThere aren't many kids around, but there's a school nearby. The neighborhood is mostly older folks, many of them retired. Instead of kids, it's all about dogs! They're everywhere, lounging in yards or racing down the street.  Be careful, though, because if you leave a door or window open, you might get an unexpected furry visitor!\n\nRabbits are another neighborhood fixture, much to the chagrin of gardeners who hate them for digging up their plants. My cats, however, delight in the chase and have thinned their ranks considerably. We have the usual assortment of birds: sparrows, hummingbirds, the occasional hawk or eagle, chased away by the neighborhood crows.\n\nThere aren't any shops nearby, but if you hike down to the waterfront, there are a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. The beach isn't much to write home about, but the rocks along the shore are fun for launching into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide, so you can easily see the other side even through the mist.",
            "My neighborhood's pretty chill, like a typical suburban spot in a small Tennessee town.  We're right in the middle of things, sandwiched between two state highways, which means there's more traffic than I'd prefer.  But other than that, it's a pretty quiet place. Folks don't move around too much, so I know most of the neighbors. They're all about the usual stuff - yard work, daily chores, that kind of thing. In the winter, we even have a hill in our street where the kids sled. Our house is on the corner, so we're practically the neighborhood watch. We know everyone's comings and goings, and we definitely notice any unfamiliar cars. Some folks like to walk for exercise or take their dogs for a stroll. The kids are always zooming around on their bikes, you know, the usual neighborhood scene.\n\nSince we work from home, we're pretty much always around. It's just me, my wife, and our two daughters, eleven and fourteen. Everyone else is used to seeing us come and go. We're a pretty active family, playing outside even when it's raining. We fire up the grill on our back deck sometimes, and that barbecue smell fills the whole neighborhood. Seems like someone's always mowing their lawn, too. From March to October, the sound of a lawnmower is practically a daily soundtrack. We've got tons of trees, which makes for nice shade, but in the fall, it's all about raking and burning leaves. I gotta say, I love that smell, it's like a signal that fall is officially here.  This year, though, we haven't had much of a winter, so it just feels like a really long fall. \n\nOur garage is at the back of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone's at the door. When I'm working on my truck or other projects in the garage, with the doors open, it feels like I'm more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays are pretty quiet around here, except for Thanksgiving and stuff like Mother's Day and Christmas.  Then, all the families have visitors, and there are cars everywhere. Overall, I really like living here. If it weren't for the traffic, it'd be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is smack-dab in the middle of the high desert, a world of dirt, dirt, and more dirt.  Unless you've lived here, it's hard to get the feeling of constantly seeing brown. When you *do* see a lawn, you know that person is splashing out big bucks on keeping it green. Back in the 90s when I first moved here, houses were spread out like stars in the night. Now, it's kind of the same, but there are a ton of new additions popping up. Honestly, it's getting more city-like every day, though I guess that's the story everywhere these days. \n\nThe people here are mostly friendly, just like any place, with its good parts and not-so-good parts. My neighborhood is full of nice older folks, which makes it feel pretty chill. As for shopping, it's mostly chains like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want something upscale, you gotta drive a bit. No Whole Foods or anything like that around here.\n\nConstruction seems to be the biggest industry, probably because there's still so much undeveloped land. It's kinda scary, though. I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and don't really want to go back. Speaking of construction, that's what my full-time job is - drywall and T-bar installation.\n\nWhat I love about where I live is the wildlife. People come to the high desert for all sorts of reasons, but the stark beauty and unique ecosystems are definitely a big draw. It's important for us humans to learn about and respect the animals that call this place home so we can all coexist peacefully. My family and I have adjusted really well. My three kids are obsessed with lizards and desert bugs; right now they're outside trying to catch some specimens.\n\nThere are some attractions around here, and Victorville is a pretty good spot for families looking for a different kind of experience. If you can time your visit with the San Bernardino County Fair, it'll be a blast. And if you're feeling adventurous, head over to nearby Wrightwood for some snow-covered mountain fun.  \n\nIf you're interested in the history and culture of the high desert, check out the Victor Valley Museum. They've got geological and paleontological stuff, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of Victorville.",
            "Let me tell you, my neighborhood is a bit different from most. While others probably talk about houses and yards, mine's more like a college campus. I live in a dorm, and my whole world revolves around that and the surrounding campus.  It's still a neighborhood, though, with its own vibe.\n\nWe've got our versions of houses: apartments, regular houses, and dorm buildings. The apartments are usually crammed with 2-4 people per room, with 4-6 rooms per floor.  Then there are the standalone houses, mostly for alumni, but they're pretty rare.  And of course, we have the dorms, which are basically havens for students.\n\nSpeaking of students, my neighborhood is a melting pot.  You've got people from all walks of life, all ages, all cultures.  \n\nWe've even got our own little shopping center with places to eat, the school store, and a grocery store. Need something? It's probably right here.  And for those who need to unwind, there's a park— kept clean and safe by everyone who calls this place home.\n\nIt's not your typical neighborhood, but it's mine, and I wouldn't trade it for the world.",
            "So, I've been living here for about a decade now, and thought I'd share some of my experiences.  When I first moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge with my family, I gotta admit, I was pretty bummed. I missed my old neighborhood and friends, and I even shed a few tears. But my parents wanted what was best for us - a better school, a safer place to live, you know, all the \"not ghetto\" stuff.  Over time, I adjusted and made new friends, even some enemies, but I never really got to know the neighbors well except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis for a while, since they lived right next door. They've become like family to me, and I'm really grateful for their presence in my life. \n\nI remember when my family went to Mr. Glen's wedding (they had a second one!). It was a blast, and it made me think about my own future wedding and giving my future wife the royal treatment. I even caught one of the little decorative straps Ms. Veda, his wife, threw during the ceremony, though sadly, not the bouquet! We danced the night away, and I had a great time hanging out with Marsharii, one of their daughters. Haven't seen her in a while, though. Hope she's doing well.\n\nThis neighborhood feels like a maze, but with GPS, I'm finally starting to explore it more. I've ventured out with my friends Kason and Curtis a few times, mostly hanging out at the local park and playing video games.  Those were good times. I also enjoy spending time in nature, it really calms me. Sometimes I bring some sticks from Home Depot to practice my balance, and even my bokken wooden sword for some practice. It's just fun to indulge in my passions.  There's also a basketball and tennis court, though I haven't played either in a while. It's nice to have them there if I ever feel like picking them up again. My dad and my best friend grew up playing tennis with Mr. Graves, and we had a blast, even though he pushed us hard!\n\nLooking back, there are tons of fun memories from this neighborhood, but these are the ones that stand out.  I know the best is yet to come!",
            "My digs are pretty close to the college, which is a major perk.  Mostly apartment buildings around here, but a few decent, not-too-expensive bars and eats to hang out at. One of the bars just got a name change – it's fancier now, but the drinks aren't drastically better.  Most folks here are either students or lower income, since the rent is pretty reasonable.  There are tons of kids 'cause there's an elementary school a hop, skip, and a jump away. I don't know my neighbors too well – I'm cool with that. They're a heavy weed-smokin' bunch, so the building management put an air freshener right outside their door.  We thought it was hilarious, kind of a passive-aggressive move, you know?  Most of the buildings around here are a little old-school, but might have been renovated inside. Down the street, there are these brand-spanking-new apartments, but I'm not a fan.  Cheaply built, but the rent is sky-high.  It's a total scam, but they can get away with it because they're near campus. There's this super cheap joint five minutes away that serves everything on paper plates and most stuff is microwaved. Across the street is a gas station, supposedly a terrible place to work. But the city put some cash into fixing up the road last summer.  Now there's a nice sidewalk, tons of grass, and the whole area looks a bit nicer. My building is tucked away under a canopy of trees – they chopped down a few, so there are stumps, but way more trees here than down the road. Behind my building is another line of trees, then another apartment complex.  I'm on 42nd, but right behind me is 43rd, and that's a rougher patch. The sidewalks are falling apart, buildings look shabby, and there are a lot of trees, probably to hide the shabbiness. Most of the crime in the area happens at an apartment complex on 43rd, but I can't blame them entirely. The buildings across the street from me have their share of crime and a revolving door of residents. But overall, I dig where I live. It's affordable, convenient, with everything I need close by.  The fact that the university is within walking distance and I have two bus stops nearby makes getting around a breeze.",
            "My neighborhood is a collection of charming duplexes arranged on a cul-de-sac, spaced out to resemble individual houses. They all share a distinctive yellow paint job, white porches, and green metal roofs. Most of the residents are friendly, often gathering at the end of driveways for casual chats while the neighborhood kids play. It's a heartwarming sense of community, a refreshing escape from the constant hum of technology that dominates modern life. It feels like stepping back in time, surrounded by fields, trees, blue skies, and fluffy white clouds.  Of course, living in the countryside comes with its quirks. This season, we've been under tornado warnings, and last night, we even heard the sirens!  I ended up seeking shelter in my bathtub, clutching my smallest dog, my purse, and a few pillows. My bigger dog wasn't too keen on the bathroom and stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The neighborhood was eerily quiet except for the sound of hail battering the ground. After the storm passed, the roads practically steamed due to the sudden temperature change. The hail melted instantly upon hitting the hot pavement. As the clouds parted, the sun emerged, and a double rainbow appeared. I grabbed my camera and snapped some pictures to share with my loved ones on Facebook. They were just as amazed as I was. The streets remained quiet for another hour before folks trickled back home. Then, life resumed its usual rhythm – moms and kids outside as dinner cooked.\n\nIt's a wonderful community for someone like me who recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I love the friendly Southern accents everyone speaks with. While all the duplexes look the same on the outside, they differ in size on the inside. Some are surprisingly small, which seems odd.  I enjoy walking through the large field behind my house and strolling down to the non-swimmable pond. I've even spotted deer and hear the booming chorus of a giant bullfrog in the mornings. It's a fantastic place to live, just forty minutes outside Charlotte. Each morning, the sound of roosters crowing from nearby farms greets me. It feels like living in a small, self-contained village. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm whose evening brays let us know he's around. I'm so lucky to have found this hidden gem of a neighborhood.",
            "So, I moved into this neighborhood when I was about to start eighth grade.  Making friends wasn't easy at first, but I eventually became close with a couple of guys—one two houses down and the other on my street. They've moved on since then, but the memories we shared stick with me. Most of the folks who were here when I first arrived are still around, which gives the place a familiar feel.  It's pretty typical suburban stuff—two-story houses everywhere, kids playing outside whenever the weather's decent, and a generally quiet vibe during the week.  \n\nI've never had any issues with anyone here. People generally keep to themselves, but they're always willing to lend a hand if you need it. I've ordered tons of stuff online and never had a package go missing. It's a safe and trustworthy neighborhood.\n\nThere's a park just a stone's throw from my house, overflowing with memories.  We used to play basketball, football, and baseball there with the other neighborhood kids. I even got clocked in the nose playing football once—definitely not my most glamorous moment. But the good times far outweigh the bad. Now, whenever I go to the park, it's to hang out with my cousin's kids. They're way younger than me and still love the swings and slides, which brings back a flood of nostalgia. Just thinking about that park takes me right back.\n\nThe neighborhood is super diverse, with tons of different cuisines within a short distance. You can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants all within a mile.  Of course, most folks nowadays just order in through apps like GrubHub and DoorDash.  The usual fast food chains are everywhere, but there are also plenty of pizza places sprinkled around, too.\n\nWe have all the necessities covered—dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, a Jewel-Osco grocery store (a Midwest staple), and even an Indian-owned store for all your homemade curry needs.\n\nOverall, I'm pretty lucky to call this place home. Reading about all the neighborly drama going on elsewhere makes me appreciate the peace and security I have here.",
            "My town, Johnston, is pretty typical for South Carolina.  It's small and quiet, but it plays a big role in the state's agriculture scene. You can't miss their claim to fame: \"Peach Capital of the World\" proudly sits on the town sign. It's basically one big farm, either bursting with peach trees or grazing cattle. Houses are spread out, mostly two-story affairs with metal roofs or gray shingles to beat the summer heat. They're often tucked back from the road, leaving front yards for animals and crops. In the town center, a single stoplight controls traffic at the four-way intersection, where you'll find all the town's shops. \n\nFor a quick bite, you've got Hong Kong, a family-run Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican, or Gary's, a small burger joint. Sadly, the pizza place closed down recently. There's Maxwell and Halford Drug, a tiny pharmacy famous for its Cherry Coke. Then there's the IGA, a smaller, pricier grocery store.  Even though it's the only one in town, most people head to a Walmart in the nearby town of Batesburg-Leesville for their big grocery hauls. The real star, though, is Dollar General. It's packed from opening to closing with folks grabbing everyday essentials. \n\nPossibilities Furniture & More, run by a friendly local, is a small furniture store with delivery service. Next door is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet groomer offering daycare, boarding, and all the pampering a pet could want. The doctor's office and the vet are a little outside the main drag, but they're well-equipped to take care of the town's residents.  Johnston Elementary School is the only one in town; after fifth grade, kids head to the neighboring town for middle and high school.\n\nDon't expect any parks or amusement spots here. They are, however, working on a small recreational area to give families more options for fun and attract new residents.  It's definitely a quiet town, so much so that you could easily drive through without even noticing.",
            "My first introduction to this place came through a podcast about missing persons, which was a bit of a shock. I couldn't believe it, considering apartments in the area were going for over a thousand dollars a month.  None of my friends had heard anything about it either. Maybe it's the struggle that keeps things under wraps. I know some of my friends have tough nights, crying themselves to sleep because things are so expensive. But we've learned how to be resourceful over time.  We've come to appreciate the musty scent of flea market finds and secondhand clothes. You learn to prioritize practicality over things that don't really matter when you're an adult. It's like the smell of adulthood itself: dusty magazines piled on a closed piano, lingering on your leather jacket even after you wash it.  Luckily, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. You can start at one end and hit two charity thrift shops, a library, a rare book store, and even a curiosity shop. Downtown is bustling with cars and people every morning, but inside the thrift stores, it's always quiet. No matter how much noise is outside, the stores remain peaceful sanctuaries. It's the perfect place to lose yourself for an afternoon. Every year, the city seems to get even more crowded. Cars and people swarm the streets, a sign of its rapid development. They call it a developing city, headquartered by one of the world's largest e-commerce and delivery empires. It's still growing, still figuring things out. It reminds me of New York City in its early days - everyone focused on their own goals, not really asking much from anyone else.  You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and nobody bats an eye. It's different from the South, where a little concern is seen as genuine care. Here, people mind their own business. You can keep your distance as long as you want, and the city just keeps rolling on like the waves on the beach. It's a vibrant place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur singers upstairs, there's always something happening.  In a way, we have less of an apartment building full of strangers and more of a community of friends. We come together for birthdays, funerals, and whatever else life throws our way, always there to support each other. I feel lucky to be here. I like most of my neighbors, and they're pretty good to me. I try to be considerate, cleaning up after myself and sharing food, and they do the same. We help each other out with mail and other errands. It's nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my company as much as I do theirs. I live in this massive, impersonal modern complex, but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I haven't completely messed up my life.",
            "So, where I live is basically your average, run-of-the-mill suburb. You know, the kind where everyone's got a perfectly manicured lawn and the homeowner's association is breathing down your neck about every little thing.  Every house looks pretty much the same: little patch of grass, some fancy rocks, a short driveway, maybe a tree or two, and a two-car garage.  You drive down the street and it's like a brand new road, no potholes or bumps in sight.  Most houses are single-story, but sometimes you'll see a two-story thrown in for good measure.\n\nSpeaking of different, our mailboxes are a bit weird. Instead of individual ones by each house, they're all clustered together at the end of the street like in an apartment building. You gotta use a key to get to your own box, and there are giant lockers for packages too.  You can thank the HOA for that little dose of uniformity.\n\n[REWRITE]",
            "I call a small Midwestern town outside a big city home. My area, on the east side, is the less affluent part of town. You'll see a lot of rented houses and folks earning lower incomes here. But it's not a bad place to be.  My neighbors are all friendly folks who wave hello when I walk by. Crime isn't super high, though it's a bit higher than in other parts of town. We've had a few shootings and even a homicide within a couple blocks of my house over the past ten years. The family next door lost their son in a shooting outside a bar last year, which was a real tragedy. Luckily, we haven't been directly affected by crime, just the occasional item snatched from our porch if we forget to bring it inside.\n\nThis town, like many across the country, has been hit hard by the opioid epidemic. We've lost people to fentanyl overdoses, it's been tough.  But there are resources here to help, like addiction recovery centers and Narcan training for families.\n\nDespite the challenges, our town has a lot going for it. My son's elementary school is fantastic – the principal, teachers, and support staff are all amazing.  He has special needs, but he's never been bullied there because the school has such a positive atmosphere.  He loves it! We have a vibrant PTO that organizes lots of events to get families involved and support learning. Since over 20% of our town lives below the poverty line, the school provides free breakfast and lunch for every student, so no kid goes hungry. No one is made to feel less than because they can't afford things – school fees, supplies, and field trips are all very reasonable.\n\nThe city council has been working hard to spruce things up, repaving roads, landscaping, and fixing up parks. Most of these improvements have been focused on the downtown and west side, where the shops are and most people drive through. The east side, where I live, seems to get left behind, which isn't fair, but hey.\n\nOverall, I'm happy living here. People are friendly, the schools are great, we have enough shopping options (both big chains and local businesses) to get by, and our house might not be worth much, but it's comfy and does the job. We've lived here for over 16 years, and we can't imagine being anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is a melting pot of culture, built on a hill with buildings that whisper stories of the past. I live in a seven-story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and just down the street is a cool arcade bar that pulls in all sorts of folks on warm summer evenings. You'll often see a line snaking down the block on weekends, especially in June and July. A few blocks up, you'll find the nearest city park, surprisingly spacious for this urban area.  Around the park is a concrete wall with tall stairs built in. During the harsh winter months, homeless folks set up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and those wide steps, seeking warmth against the biting cold and frequent downpours. Clustering together in the heart of town, rather than out in the open, helps them stay warmer. Plus, they're within easy reach of the only family center for miles, where they can shower and find some comfort.\n\nBut what I truly love about this city isn't just the history and architecture that grace its hills, leading down to the ocean. It's the people. You see, Hilltop has a past, a notorious one, as the West Coast's most violent neighborhood. Even decades later, stories circulate about federal agents and the DEA trying to clean up the streets. Those stories echo through generations, reaching newcomers like me. Despite its rough reputation, the residents work hard to keep it clean and cared for. They still have a strong sense of community, a fierce loyalty.  \n\nThere's a saying, \"If you're white, don't walk around Hilltop after dark.\"  I think it's a relic of the past, a leftover from a time of fear and prejudice, perhaps even a bit of self-preservation. Maybe it's because I'm dark enough to blend in, or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of their own, someone who understands the underlying tensions that still linger.  We're all reminded of how racism and assumptions can blind people to the truth, even in a city that prides itself on being a melting pot. But one thing is certain: no matter where I go, Hilltop will always feel like home. \n\nWalking its streets at night, encountering people who offer me a jacket before a wallet, makes me feel alive. It's a place where the laundromat owner stays open late so I can charge my phone when trapped by the rain. It's a place where I've huddled unseen against shop fronts on the bleakest nights, only to have someone stop, meet my eyes, hand me $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I live in a small town in rural Michigan, where farmland blends into quaint tourist spots. You won't find any big city chains like malls, Walmart, or even an Applebee's here. Everything requires a drive to get to.  Despite the lack of bustling city life, I live in a breathtaking place surrounded by water. Both Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix border my town, offering beaches practically everywhere you go.\n\nMy neighborhood embodies the classic small-town feel. Houses aren't crammed together, and they're not cookie-cutter designs. They're older homes, some modernized, others retaining their original charm. Most have full basements visible from the street, and you'll find a mix of architectural styles and colors. Yards are common, with trampolines, playsets, gardens, and even fences for animals. \n\nIt's a neighborhood of hardworking folks – families raising children or enjoying life after raising them. Kids are constantly running around, and you'll see people walking dogs, biking, and rollerblading. Neighbors know each other, and a sense of community prevails. You'll see someone grilling and wave back, or smile at a dog walker passing by. Lawns are well-maintained, with no piles of leaves or overgrown greenery. \n\nWhile not picture-perfect, it's a place where you can picture raising a family. It's quiet, peaceful, and safe.  It's not about stunning aesthetics, but about providing a sense of belonging and security. \n\nWithin walking distance, you'll find the county sheriff's department, jail, health department, and recycling center, all serving the community. Nearby, baseball and softball fields echo with the sounds of games, and our small town airport provides a constant soundtrack of planes taking off and landing. You can even walk to the local ice cream parlor, or if you're feeling adventurous, make it downtown. My kids can easily bike to the park, just eight blocks away. \n\nIt's a truly great place to call home."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "My neighborhood is a snapshot of Americana, full of single-family homes with a few split into doubles, clinging to the idea of the suburban dream.  My place has a little front yard and a tiny driveway, a throwback to a time when this kind of life was the epitome of success.  You can almost feel the dream fading, though.  The houses still stand, a testament to a time when hope was stronger, but the yards aren't kept up like they used to be, and there's a sense of resignation in the air. You still see kids playing, seemingly oblivious to the world's worries, and the 90-year-old school still stands, a symbol of a future that feels uncertain. Churches are scarce, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are bustling.  It's a mix of old and new, with each house wearing its history differently.\n\nThere's a big supermarket owned by a Yemenite family, probably the only Arab family around, surrounded by mostly African American neighbors.  The streets are wide, perfect for kids kicking a football, only pausing to let cars pass. Most folks here have roots that run deep, families who've been around for generations, sharing stories of a time when everyone knew everyone. Even the businesses have stories.  The karate school, once a hot spot, turned into a pharmacy when Hollywood stopped making \"Karate Kid\" movies. Apparently, pills are the new kicks. There's a small, old movie theater, showing classic films for a song, loved by the older crowd but ignored by the younger generation who crave the latest blockbusters.\n\nThe only expressway cuts through the town next door, a constant reminder of the world outside. There was a push to get an exit, championed by the young folks, but the older generation, fiercely protective of their town, convinced the city council to say no. Now, they're building a new high school, but the question of a mascot is a hot topic.  I think a cyborg with a country drawl and a log cabin would perfectly capture the essence of this place: a blend of the old and the new, clinging to tradition while facing an uncertain future.",
            "This neighborhood might not seem like much at first glance. Tucked behind a shopping strip in a residential area, it doesn't scream \"desirable living.\"  But if you venture past the old, forgotten Whole Foods and the hotels that only buzz with life during summer reunions, you'll discover a thriving community hidden in plain sight. \n\nYou'll find a cluster of apartment complexes lined up like carefully disassembled Russian nesting dolls, each nestled beside the other. Some complexes have a shady past, making headlines for less-than-savory dealings, but let’s just say appearances can be deceiving. Just a little further down the road, you'll stumble upon a different world, a secret known only to a select few.  \n\nAcross from these complexes sits a quiet community college campus, its sleepy buildings watching over the road. Students shuffle in, bleary-eyed and clutching coffee at 7 am, their arrival greeted by the frustrated honks of commuters who wish they'd stay home.  \n\nThe road leads to another residential street, where a park sits on one side and a rehabilitation center rests on the other.  The center boasts a cheerful porch with gently whirring ceiling fans, a stark contrast to the commotion outside. Children’s laughter echoes through the park, mixing with the buzzing of bees in the flower patches. Retired folks stroll with their dogs, eyeing the skateboarders with disapproval and offering polite nods to the teenage girls gossiping by the playground. \n\nNearby, a strip mall offers a slice of Americana. A sushi place with cheap eats and a constant flow of customers sits next to a swimming supply store and a nail salon.  You could get your pool ready for summer, get your nails done, and enjoy some hibachi chicken, all in one stop.  \n\nAnd there's the frozen yogurt shop, the kind where you build your own concoction, perfect for the teens who hang out in the park, their faces smeared with toppings and their lungs filled with vape smoke, convinced they are the coolest kids around. \n\nThis neighborhood is a snapshot of sleepy Southern life, where change moves at a leisurely pace, and time itself seems to slow down.",

She came from a town where the grocery store was just a stone's throw away, she'd never experienced anything like this before.  Overwhelmed by the sea of corn, I told her stories about growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood where I came from.\n\nFollow this two-lane country road, and you'll reach a quarry filled with water. Just past it lies the small development where I live.  The houses are mostly brick and stucco, each sitting on at least half an acre of land that everyone takes pride in keeping pristine.

            "Alright, let me break down Portland for ya. See, \"weird\" isn't just a word here, it's practically the city motto.  You'll find it spray-painted on buildings that are also pizza joints, bars, music venues, and who knows what else.  Some folks think it's a throwback to the good ol' days, when Portland was more laid-back and affordable. Back when it was a breeding ground for unique subcultures.  But for others, it's an invitation - come on down to Portland, where being a little different is celebrated.  \n\nLook, even with all the Californians moving in and the fancy condos popping up, Portland still holds onto that weird vibe.  It's not about blind acceptance, it's about accepting things that don't quite fit the norm.  We've got our fair share of modern conveniences and problems, just like everywhere else. We buy our stuff from China, we have yoga studios and hipsters, we've got the whole nine yards.  Maybe \"weird\" means we just take it all a little less seriously.\n\nTake my neighborhood, for example.  You'll see colorful houses, gardens overflowing with flowers, herbs, and veggies, and these magical things called \"free boxes\" scattered around.  Think of them as sidewalk treasure chests, overflowing with clothes, books, and who knows what else. You never know what you'll find. It's all part of the Portland charm.\n\nBut hey, \"weird\" comes in all shapes and sizes. Some folks wouldn't touch a free box with a ten-foot pole. They're off doing goat yoga or cheering for the Timbers, our local soccer team.  Portland's a melting pot of people chasing their dreams, or at least dreaming about chasing them while enjoying a few too many beers.\n\nNow, let's be real, Portland has its struggles. We've got a drug problem, which often stems from deeper mental health issues.  The constant drizzle and gloomy skies don't help matters.  And homelessness is a huge issue, though no one seems to have a magic solution.  We've got social services, but they're stretched thin, just like everywhere else.  People here, like everywhere else, grapple with feelings of compassion and frustration when it comes to the homeless population.\n\nSo, yeah, Portland's weird.  But it's also real.  It's a city full of contradictions, full of people striving and struggling, just like everywhere else in the world.  But somehow, it all works.",
            "The mountains have always been there, standing tall in the north, witnessing every sunrise and sunset. Even when I'm lost in work or life, they remain a constant presence, steadfast and unmoved by the ups and downs of daily life.  On days when stress gets the best of me, they seem to call out to me. When I turn towards them, they offer a sense of peace and strength, helping me to face each day.  I first fell in love with these mountains when I moved here for college. While the university itself has its own beauty in its buildings, ponds, and trees, the mountains hold a special place in my heart.  The town itself is lovely, with charming cafes that fueled countless study sessions. A short walk or bus ride takes you to the downtown area, where faded brick buildings create a sense of history and bustle, reminding you of the nearby city. This vibrant energy doesn't last long, though, as you can quickly escape back to the peaceful small-town atmosphere by passing the library. This blend of contrasting vibes creates a unique charm, inviting exploration and making it easy to create lasting memories.  There are memories of walking past rusty swings in the park with friends after late-night study sessions, and running through the bustling downtown to catch a movie at the fancy theater thanks to a university discount. But there are also harder memories, as there are in every place. The ponds, in particular, can be places of both reflection and tears during those late-night existential crises, which I've had my fair share of. Watching turtles, ducks, and insects go about their lives, each playing a role, made me question my own purpose as I struggled to navigate life's complexities.  So, I walked past the pond, the park, and the quaint little houses that scream \"suburbia,\" until I reached a main street. As the sun rose, bathing the palm trees in its golden light, I realized I was walking north. And there they were, as always: the mountains, reaching towards the sky, a silent reminder of perseverance.",

You'll practically stumble upon an Asian-owned store every block you walk – supermarkets, laundromats, you name it. Locals swear by these places because the food is top-notch, prices are killer, and it's super convenient. I'm talking four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk from where I am!\n\nNow, Bensonhurst isn't just an Asian enclave, mind you. It's a mix of folks from all walks of life – immigrants, first- and second-generation Americans, the whole shebang.  While the Asian-owned businesses are definitely prominent, there's also a recently revamped park nearby that's a real gem. Think ten basketball courts, a huge field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground, even a water fountain for the little ones to splash around in.  And just like everywhere in NYC, the park's got a melting pot of people enjoying themselves. \n\nYou won't find any massive corporate towers here, just cozy co-op buildings, condos, and mostly two-family houses. The people are generally friendly, but they're known for being a bit loud. Think cars blasting music, revving engines in the morning – it's definitely not a quiet neighborhood.  \n\nIf you're planning a night-time visit, just be aware that while Bensonhurst is generally safe, you never know what you might encounter. There's always a chance you might run into someone looking for trouble, or even some petty theft.  I've personally had some run-ins with bullies in the past, but that was a while back.  Package theft is also a thing here, unfortunately.\n\nAnd one last thing – forget about the city's \"clean up after your dog\" rules. Dog waste is everywhere! Seriously, be prepared to dodge it on your way to the train or the supermarket. It's my biggest pet peeve in the entire neighborhood. Watch your step and keep those shoes clean!",
            "My neighborhood is a quirky place, tucked away on a steep hill with hardly any sidewalks. It's nicknamed the \"work out hill\" because it's a popular spot for joggers, but with no sidewalks you have to share the hilly road with them—a road that's not in the best shape and can be a bit of a hazard!\n\nThe neighborhood's got an almost patchwork look, with old, worn-down power lines strung up between houses. The constant rain and storms often knock branches down on them, leading to repairs that leave them looking patched up.  Everywhere you look, there are towering evergreen trees, but surprisingly, most people here despise them. They're constantly trying to chop them down because they block the view of the ocean. That's why so many houses are perched high on the hill, with massive glass second stories that reach for the horizon, craving that ocean vista.\n\nSunsets are breathtaking here, with the water glowing from below and the sky turning shades of orange. But most days are overcast, so the sunlight filters through a hazy veil. It's often damp and misty, with moss growing on everything—roofs, cars, even railings! I once left my car parked for a month and came back to find it covered in a thick layer of moss—took forever to scrub it off!\n\nThere aren't many kids around, but there's a school nearby. The neighborhood is mostly older folks, many of them retired. Instead of kids, it's all about dogs! They're everywhere, lounging in yards or racing down the street.  Be careful, though, because if you leave a door or window open, you might get an unexpected furry visitor!\n\nRabbits are another neighborhood fixture, much to the chagrin of gardeners who hate them for digging up their plants. My cats, however, delight in the chase and have thinned their ranks considerably. We have the usual assortment of birds: sparrows, hummingbirds, the occasional hawk or eagle, chased away by the neighborhood crows.\n\nThere aren't any shops nearby, but if you hike down to the waterfront, there are a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. The beach isn't much to write home about, but the rocks along the shore are fun for launching into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide, so you can easily see the other side even through the mist.",
            "My neighborhood's pretty chill, like a typical suburban spot in a small Tennessee town.  We're right in the middle of things, sandwiched between two state highways, which means there's more traffic than I'd prefer.  But other than that, it's a pretty quiet place. Folks don't move around too much, so I know most of the neighbors. They're all about the usual stuff - yard work, daily chores, that kind of thing. In the winter, we even have a hill in our street where the kids sled. Our house is on the corner, so we're practically the neighborhood watch. We know everyone's comings and goings, and we definitely notice any unfamiliar cars. Some folks like to walk for exercise or take their dogs for a stroll. The kids are always zooming around on their bikes, you know, the usual neighborhood scene.\n\nSince we work from home, we're pretty much always around. It's just me, my wife, and our two daughters, eleven and fourteen. Everyone else is used to seeing us come and go. We're a pretty active family, playing outside even when it's raining. We fire up the grill on our back deck sometimes, and that barbecue smell fills the whole neighborhood. Seems like someone's always mowing their lawn, too. From March to October, the sound of a lawnmower is practically a daily soundtrack. We've got tons of trees, which makes for nice shade, but in the fall, it's all about raking and burning leaves. I gotta say, I love that smell, it's like a signal that fall is officially here.  This year, though, we haven't had much of a winter, so it just feels like a really long fall. \n\nOur garage is at the back of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone's at the door. When I'm working on my truck or other projects in the garage, with the doors open, it feels like I'm more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays are pretty quiet around here, except for Thanksgiving and stuff like Mother's Day and Christmas.  Then, all the families have visitors, and there are cars everywhere. Overall, I really like living here. If it weren't for the traffic, it'd be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is smack-dab in the middle of the high desert, a world of dirt, dirt, and more dirt.  Unless you've lived here, it's hard to get the feeling of constantly seeing brown. When you *do* see a lawn, you know that person is splashing out big bucks on keeping it green. Back in the 90s when I first moved here, houses were spread out like stars in the night. Now, it's kind of the same, but there are a ton of new additions popping up. Honestly, it's getting more city-like every day, though I guess that's the story everywhere these days. \n\nThe people here are mostly friendly, just like any place, with its good parts and not-so-good parts. My neighborhood is full of nice older folks, which makes it feel pretty chill. As for shopping, it's mostly chains like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want something upscale, you gotta drive a bit. No Whole Foods or anything like that around here.\n\nConstruction seems to be the biggest industry, probably because there's still so much undeveloped land. It's kinda scary, though. I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and don't really want to go back. Speaking of construction, that's what my full-time job is - drywall and T-bar installation.\n\nWhat I love about where I live is the wildlife. People come to the high desert for all sorts of reasons, but the stark beauty and unique ecosystems are definitely a big draw. It's important for us humans to learn about and respect the animals that call this place home so we can all coexist peacefully. My family and I have adjusted really well. My three kids are obsessed with lizards and desert bugs; right now they're outside trying to catch some specimens.\n\nThere are some attractions around here, and Victorville is a pretty good spot for families looking for a different kind of experience. If you can time your visit with the San Bernardino County Fair, it'll be a blast. And if you're feeling adventurous, head over to nearby Wrightwood for some snow-covered mountain fun.  \n\nIf you're interested in the history and culture of the high desert, check out the Victor Valley Museum. They've got geological and paleontological stuff, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of Victorville.",
            "Let me tell you, my neighborhood is a bit different from most. While others probably talk about houses and yards, mine's more like a college campus. I live in a dorm, and my whole world revolves around that and the surrounding campus.  It's still a neighborhood, though, with its own vibe.\n\nWe've got our versions of houses: apartments, regular houses, and dorm buildings. The apartments are usually crammed with 2-4 people per room, with 4-6 rooms per floor.  Then there are the standalone houses, mostly for alumni, but they're pretty rare.  And of course, we have the dorms, which are basically havens for students.\n\nSpeaking of students, my neighborhood is a melting pot.  You've got people from all walks of life, all ages, all cultures.  \n\nWe've even got our own little shopping center with places to eat, the school store, and a grocery store. Need something? It's probably right here.  And for those who need to unwind, there's a park— kept clean and safe by everyone who calls this place home.\n\nIt's not your typical neighborhood, but it's mine, and I wouldn't trade it for the world.",
            "So, I've been living here for about a decade now, and thought I'd share some of my experiences.  When I first moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge with my family, I gotta admit, I was pretty bummed. I missed my old neighborhood and friends, and I even shed a few tears. But my parents wanted what was best for us - a better school, a safer place to live, you know, all the \"not ghetto\" stuff.  Over time, I adjusted and made new friends, even some enemies, but I never really got to know the neighbors well except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis for a while, since they lived right next door. They've become like family to me, and I'm really grateful for their presence in my life. \n\nI remember when my family went to Mr. Glen's wedding (they had a second one!). It was a blast, and it made me think about my own future wedding and giving my future wife the royal treatment. I even caught one of the little decorative straps Ms. Veda, his wife, threw during the ceremony, though sadly, not the bouquet! We danced the night away, and I had a great time hanging out with Marsharii, one of their daughters. Haven't seen her in a while, though. Hope she's doing well.\n\nThis neighborhood feels like a maze, but with GPS, I'm finally starting to explore it more. I've ventured out with my friends Kason and Curtis a few times, mostly hanging out at the local park and playing video games.  Those were good times. I also enjoy spending time in nature, it really calms me. Sometimes I bring some sticks from Home Depot to practice my balance, and even my bokken wooden sword for some practice. It's just fun to indulge in my passions.  There's also a basketball and tennis court, though I haven't played either in a while. It's nice to have them there if I ever feel like picking them up again. My dad and my best friend grew up playing tennis with Mr. Graves, and we had a blast, even though he pushed us hard!\n\nLooking back, there are tons of fun memories from this neighborhood, but these are the ones that stand out.  I know the best is yet to come!",
            "My digs are pretty close to the college, which is a major perk.  Mostly apartment buildings around here, but a few decent, not-too-expensive bars and eats to hang out at. One of the bars just got a name change – it's fancier now, but the drinks aren't drastically better.  Most folks here are either students or lower income, since the rent is pretty reasonable.  There are tons of kids 'cause there's an elementary school a hop, skip, and a jump away. I don't know my neighbors too well – I'm cool with that. They're a heavy weed-smokin' bunch, so the building management put an air freshener right outside their door.  We thought it was hilarious, kind of a passive-aggressive move, you know?  Most of the buildings around here are a little old-school, but might have been renovated inside. Down the street, there are these brand-spanking-new apartments, but I'm not a fan.  Cheaply built, but the rent is sky-high.  It's a total scam, but they can get away with it because they're near campus. There's this super cheap joint five minutes away that serves everything on paper plates and most stuff is microwaved. Across the street is a gas station, supposedly a terrible place to work. But the city put some cash into fixing up the road last summer.  Now there's a nice sidewalk, tons of grass, and the whole area looks a bit nicer. My building is tucked away under a canopy of trees – they chopped down a few, so there are stumps, but way more trees here than down the road. Behind my building is another line of trees, then another apartment complex.  I'm on 42nd, but right behind me is 43rd, and that's a rougher patch. The sidewalks are falling apart, buildings look shabby, and there are a lot of trees, probably to hide the shabbiness. Most of the crime in the area happens at an apartment complex on 43rd, but I can't blame them entirely. The buildings across the street from me have their share of crime and a revolving door of residents. But overall, I dig where I live. It's affordable, convenient, with everything I need close by.  The fact that the university is within walking distance and I have two bus stops nearby makes getting around a breeze.",
            "My neighborhood is a collection of charming duplexes arranged on a cul-de-sac, spaced out to resemble individual houses. They all share a distinctive yellow paint job, white porches, and green metal roofs. Most of the residents are friendly, often gathering at the end of driveways for casual chats while the neighborhood kids play. It's a heartwarming sense of community, a refreshing escape from the constant hum of technology that dominates modern life. It feels like stepping back in time, surrounded by fields, trees, blue skies, and fluffy white clouds.  Of course, living in the countryside comes with its quirks. This season, we've been under tornado warnings, and last night, we even heard the sirens!  I ended up seeking shelter in my bathtub, clutching my smallest dog, my purse, and a few pillows. My bigger dog wasn't too keen on the bathroom and stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The neighborhood was eerily quiet except for the sound of hail battering the ground. After the storm passed, the roads practically steamed due to the sudden temperature change. The hail melted instantly upon hitting the hot pavement. As the clouds parted, the sun emerged, and a double rainbow appeared. I grabbed my camera and snapped some pictures to share with my loved ones on Facebook. They were just as amazed as I was. The streets remained quiet for another hour before folks trickled back home. Then, life resumed its usual rhythm – moms and kids outside as dinner cooked.\n\nIt's a wonderful community for someone like me who recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I love the friendly Southern accents everyone speaks with. While all the duplexes look the same on the outside, they differ in size on the inside. Some are surprisingly small, which seems odd.  I enjoy walking through the large field behind my house and strolling down to the non-swimmable pond. I've even spotted deer and hear the booming chorus of a giant bullfrog in the mornings. It's a fantastic place to live, just forty minutes outside Charlotte. Each morning, the sound of roosters crowing from nearby farms greets me. It feels like living in a small, self-contained village. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm whose evening brays let us know he's around. I'm so lucky to have found this hidden gem of a neighborhood.",
            "So, I moved into this neighborhood when I was about to start eighth grade.  Making friends wasn't easy at first, but I eventually became close with a couple of guys—one two houses down and the other on my street. They've moved on since then, but the memories we shared stick with me. Most of the folks who were here when I first arrived are still around, which gives the place a familiar feel.  It's pretty typical suburban stuff—two-story houses everywhere, kids playing outside whenever the weather's decent, and a generally quiet vibe during the week.  \n\nI've never had any issues with anyone here. People generally keep to themselves, but they're always willing to lend a hand if you need it. I've ordered tons of stuff online and never had a package go missing. It's a safe and trustworthy neighborhood.\n\nThere's a park just a stone's throw from my house, overflowing with memories.  We used to play basketball, football, and baseball there with the other neighborhood kids. I even got clocked in the nose playing football once—definitely not my most glamorous moment. But the good times far outweigh the bad. Now, whenever I go to the park, it's to hang out with my cousin's kids. They're way younger than me and still love the swings and slides, which brings back a flood of nostalgia. Just thinking about that park takes me right back.\n\nThe neighborhood is super diverse, with tons of different cuisines within a short distance. You can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants all within a mile.  Of course, most folks nowadays just order in through apps like GrubHub and DoorDash.  The usual fast food chains are everywhere, but there are also plenty of pizza places sprinkled around, too.\n\nWe have all the necessities covered—dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, a Jewel-Osco grocery store (a Midwest staple), and even an Indian-owned store for all your homemade curry needs.\n\nOverall, I'm pretty lucky to call this place home. Reading about all the neighborly drama going on elsewhere makes me appreciate the peace and security I have here.",
            "My town, Johnston, is pretty typical for South Carolina.  It's small and quiet, but it plays a big role in the state's agriculture scene. You can't miss their claim to fame: \"Peach Capital of the World\" proudly sits on the town sign. It's basically one big farm, either bursting with peach trees or grazing cattle. Houses are spread out, mostly two-story affairs with metal roofs or gray shingles to beat the summer heat. They're often tucked back from the road, leaving front yards for animals and crops. In the town center, a single stoplight controls traffic at the four-way intersection, where you'll find all the town's shops. \n\nFor a quick bite, you've got Hong Kong, a family-run Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican, or Gary's, a small burger joint. Sadly, the pizza place closed down recently. There's Maxwell and Halford Drug, a tiny pharmacy famous for its Cherry Coke. Then there's the IGA, a smaller, pricier grocery store.  Even though it's the only one in town, most people head to a Walmart in the nearby town of Batesburg-Leesville for their big grocery hauls. The real star, though, is Dollar General. It's packed from opening to closing with folks grabbing everyday essentials. \n\nPossibilities Furniture & More, run by a friendly local, is a small furniture store with delivery service. Next door is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet groomer offering daycare, boarding, and all the pampering a pet could want. The doctor's office and the vet are a little outside the main drag, but they're well-equipped to take care of the town's residents.  Johnston Elementary School is the only one in town; after fifth grade, kids head to the neighboring town for middle and high school.\n\nDon't expect any parks or amusement spots here. They are, however, working on a small recreational area to give families more options for fun and attract new residents.  It's definitely a quiet town, so much so that you could easily drive through without even noticing.",
            "My first introduction to this place came through a podcast about missing persons, which was a bit of a shock. I couldn't believe it, considering apartments in the area were going for over a thousand dollars a month.  None of my friends had heard anything about it either. Maybe it's the struggle that keeps things under wraps. I know some of my friends have tough nights, crying themselves to sleep because things are so expensive. But we've learned how to be resourceful over time.  We've come to appreciate the musty scent of flea market finds and secondhand clothes. You learn to prioritize practicality over things that don't really matter when you're an adult. It's like the smell of adulthood itself: dusty magazines piled on a closed piano, lingering on your leather jacket even after you wash it.  Luckily, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. You can start at one end and hit two charity thrift shops, a library, a rare book store, and even a curiosity shop. Downtown is bustling with cars and people every morning, but inside the thrift stores, it's always quiet. No matter how much noise is outside, the stores remain peaceful sanctuaries. It's the perfect place to lose yourself for an afternoon. Every year, the city seems to get even more crowded. Cars and people swarm the streets, a sign of its rapid development. They call it a developing city, headquartered by one of the world's largest e-commerce and delivery empires. It's still growing, still figuring things out. It reminds me of New York City in its early days - everyone focused on their own goals, not really asking much from anyone else.  You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and nobody bats an eye. It's different from the South, where a little concern is seen as genuine care. Here, people mind their own business. You can keep your distance as long as you want, and the city just keeps rolling on like the waves on the beach. It's a vibrant place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur singers upstairs, there's always something happening.  In a way, we have less of an apartment building full of strangers and more of a community of friends. We come together for birthdays, funerals, and whatever else life throws our way, always there to support each other. I feel lucky to be here. I like most of my neighbors, and they're pretty good to me. I try to be considerate, cleaning up after myself and sharing food, and they do the same. We help each other out with mail and other errands. It's nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my company as much as I do theirs. I live in this massive, impersonal modern complex, but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I haven't completely messed up my life.",
            "So, where I live is basically your average, run-of-the-mill suburb. You know, the kind where everyone's got a perfectly manicured lawn and the homeowner's association is breathing down your neck about every little thing.  Every house looks pretty much the same: little patch of grass, some fancy rocks, a short driveway, maybe a tree or two, and a two-car garage.  You drive down the street and it's like a brand new road, no potholes or bumps in sight.  Most houses are single-story, but sometimes you'll see a two-story thrown in for good measure.\n\nSpeaking of different, our mailboxes are a bit weird. Instead of individual ones by each house, they're all clustered together at the end of the street like in an apartment building. You gotta use a key to get to your own box, and there are giant lockers for packages too.  You can thank the HOA for that little dose of uniformity.\n\n[REWRITE]",
            "I call a small Midwestern town outside a big city home. My area, on the east side, is the less affluent part of town. You'll see a lot of rented houses and folks earning lower incomes here. But it's not a bad place to be.  My neighbors are all friendly folks who wave hello when I walk by. Crime isn't super high, though it's a bit higher than in other parts of town. We've had a few shootings and even a homicide within a couple blocks of my house over the past ten years. The family next door lost their son in a shooting outside a bar last year, which was a real tragedy. Luckily, we haven't been directly affected by crime, just the occasional item snatched from our porch if we forget to bring it inside.\n\nThis town, like many across the country, has been hit hard by the opioid epidemic. We've lost people to fentanyl overdoses, it's been tough.  But there are resources here to help, like addiction recovery centers and Narcan training for families.\n\nDespite the challenges, our town has a lot going for it. My son's elementary school is fantastic – the principal, teachers, and support staff are all amazing.  He has special needs, but he's never been bullied there because the school has such a positive atmosphere.  He loves it! We have a vibrant PTO that organizes lots of events to get families involved and support learning. Since over 20% of our town lives below the poverty line, the school provides free breakfast and lunch for every student, so no kid goes hungry. No one is made to feel less than because they can't afford things – school fees, supplies, and field trips are all very reasonable.\n\nThe city council has been working hard to spruce things up, repaving roads, landscaping, and fixing up parks. Most of these improvements have been focused on the downtown and west side, where the shops are and most people drive through. The east side, where I live, seems to get left behind, which isn't fair, but hey.\n\nOverall, I'm happy living here. People are friendly, the schools are great, we have enough shopping options (both big chains and local businesses) to get by, and our house might not be worth much, but it's comfy and does the job. We've lived here for over 16 years, and we can't imagine being anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is a melting pot of culture, built on a hill with buildings that whisper stories of the past. I live in a seven-story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and just down the street is a cool arcade bar that pulls in all sorts of folks on warm summer evenings. You'll often see a line snaking down the block on weekends, especially in June and July. A few blocks up, you'll find the nearest city park, surprisingly spacious for this urban area.  Around the park is a concrete wall with tall stairs built in. During the harsh winter months, homeless folks set up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and those wide steps, seeking warmth against the biting cold and frequent downpours. Clustering together in the heart of town, rather than out in the open, helps them stay warmer. Plus, they're within easy reach of the only family center for miles, where they can shower and find some comfort.\n\nBut what I truly love about this city isn't just the history and architecture that grace its hills, leading down to the ocean. It's the people. You see, Hilltop has a past, a notorious one, as the West Coast's most violent neighborhood. Even decades later, stories circulate about federal agents and the DEA trying to clean up the streets. Those stories echo through generations, reaching newcomers like me. Despite its rough reputation, the residents work hard to keep it clean and cared for. They still have a strong sense of community, a fierce loyalty.  \n\nThere's a saying, \"If you're white, don't walk around Hilltop after dark.\"  I think it's a relic of the past, a leftover from a time of fear and prejudice, perhaps even a bit of self-preservation. Maybe it's because I'm dark enough to blend in, or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of their own, someone who understands the underlying tensions that still linger.  We're all reminded of how racism and assumptions can blind people to the truth, even in a city that prides itself on being a melting pot. But one thing is certain: no matter where I go, Hilltop will always feel like home. \n\nWalking its streets at night, encountering people who offer me a jacket before a wallet, makes me feel alive. It's a place where the laundromat owner stays open late so I can charge my phone when trapped by the rain. It's a place where I've huddled unseen against shop fronts on the bleakest nights, only to have someone stop, meet my eyes, hand me $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I live in a small town in rural Michigan, where farmland blends into quaint tourist spots. You won't find any big city chains like malls, Walmart, or even an Applebee's here. Everything requires a drive to get to.  Despite the lack of bustling city life, I live in a breathtaking place surrounded by water. Both Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix border my town, offering beaches practically everywhere you go.\n\nMy neighborhood embodies the classic small-town feel. Houses aren't crammed together, and they're not cookie-cutter designs. They're older homes, some modernized, others retaining their original charm. Most have full basements visible from the street, and you'll find a mix of architectural styles and colors. Yards are common, with trampolines, playsets, gardens, and even fences for animals. \n\nIt's a neighborhood of hardworking folks – families raising children or enjoying life after raising them. Kids are constantly running around, and you'll see people walking dogs, biking, and rollerblading. Neighbors know each other, and a sense of community prevails. You'll see someone grilling and wave back, or smile at a dog walker passing by. Lawns are well-maintained, with no piles of leaves or overgrown greenery. \n\nWhile not picture-perfect, it's a place where you can picture raising a family. It's quiet, peaceful, and safe.  It's not about stunning aesthetics, but about providing a sense of belonging and security. \n\nWithin walking distance, you'll find the county sheriff's department, jail, health department, and recycling center, all serving the community. Nearby, baseball and softball fields echo with the sounds of games, and our small town airport provides a constant soundtrack of planes taking off and landing. You can even walk to the local ice cream parlor, or if you're feeling adventurous, make it downtown. My kids can easily bike to the park, just eight blocks away. \n\nIt's a truly great place to call home."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "My neighborhood in this massive city is a real melting pot.  Residential areas pop up randomly between all these businesses - offices, shops, restaurants, you name it. There's always something new to try, whether it's a fancy restaurant or a quirky little boutique.  Big brands definitely have their place, but these independent shops are gaining popularity, popping up in malls and lining the streets, bringing a touch of excitement to what would otherwise be quiet neighborhoods.  And speaking of excitement, there are a couple of parks nearby that are always bustling with families.  \n\nThis diversity extends to the people too. We've got a big LGBTQ+ community, a thriving Orthodox Jewish community, and a bunch of folks who've moved here from the former Soviet Union, all in one small area.  Venture a bit further out, and you'll find even more cultures represented.  It's like a mini United Nations with \"Korea Town,\" \"China Town,\" \"Little Armenia,\" and so many more, all just a short (or long, depending on traffic) drive away.  Speaking of traffic, this city is notorious for it.  Even a 10-mile journey can easily take two hours during rush hour.  Walking isn't really an option, since the city is massive and people are glued to their cars.  Which, ironically, leads to the city being choked with cars and parking being a nightmare. \n\nAdding to the chaos, they're constantly building new apartment buildings, which is great for newcomers but makes existing residents groan at the thought of even more people and traffic.  But hey, not everyone wants to live in a giant apartment building.  My neighborhood has a mix of houses, from small bungalows to sprawling mansions, and everything in between.  You've got your single-family homes, duplexes, and smaller apartment complexes.  \n\nAnd the people?  A real mix of ages, but to be honest, I don't know most of them.  It's not as tight-knit as it used to be back when I was a kid and spent my days playing with my next-door neighbor and a few other neighborhood kids.",
            "My neighborhood is a bit of a time capsule, a snapshot of a bygone era. Most of the houses are single-family dwellings, some split into two while still attached, creating a unique kind of clustered intimacy. My place has a small front yard and a tiny driveway – a picture of suburban normalcy that once embodied the American dream.  \n\nThere's a bittersweet nostalgia hanging in the air. While the dream feels a bit distant now, the houses still whisper of a time when things were simpler, when the dream felt more attainable. People aren't as optimistic as they used to be, the yards aren't as manicured, but there are still cars in every driveway, and kids playing like the world revolves around their games. The old public school, standing strong after almost 90 years, seems to promise a future to the young while stirring memories in the older folks. \n\nThe churches are mostly empty, but the basketball courts are always buzzing. Every house has its own story, its own character, yet they all share a similar feeling – a sense of quiet community. The highlight is Super \"A,\" the local supermarket run by a Yemeni family, probably the only Arab family around.  \n\nMost folks are African American, and they've been here for generations, their roots intertwined with the neighborhood's history.  The streets are wide, and kids play football, stopping only for cars to pass. There are stories passed down from parent to child, tales of a time when everyone knew everyone. The karate school, once a hub of youthful aspirations, is now a pharmacy – reflecting a shift in priorities. \n\nEven the old movie theater, showing classic films at bargain prices, still draws crowds, mostly the older residents who appreciate a night out without the distractions of the latest releases. The expressway cuts through the town next door, a constant reminder of the outside world, a world that the town elders, with their yearning for a simpler time, have actively kept at bay. They ultimately blocked the petition for a local exit, fearing it would disrupt the town's tranquility.  A new high school is being built, and the town is debating a mascot. My vote? A cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin – the perfect embodiment of our town's unique blend of old and new.",
            "You might pass it over at first glance. It's tucked behind shops, not exactly a place that screams \"desirable living.\"  Not unless you're into the kind of hidden gems most people overlook.  But if you venture past the old, deserted Whole Foods and the hotels that only see action during family reunions, you'll stumble upon a vibrant community.  Imagine apartment complexes squeezed together like Russian nesting dolls, meticulously disassembled and lined up along the road.  The first ones you encounter are known for some shady dealings, so let's not dwell on those.  Appearances can be deceiving, after all. But the complexes next door, and the ones beyond those, are a world apart, a secret known only to a select few.  Across from them sits a community college branch, a sleepy collection of buildings where students shuffle in with coffee, yawning at 7 a.m. They trudge through the iron gates, which creak open one by one, while commuters bellow in frustration at the morning rush. The road intersects with another residential street, leading to a park on one side and a rehabilitation center on the other. The center's porch is decked out with cheerful furniture, and a lazy ceiling fan stirs the heavy summer air. \n\nKids zoom around the park, cartwheeling and giggling, while bees buzz lazily around the flower patches.  Seniors stroll their dogs, shaking their heads at the skateboarders and exchanging knowing glances with the teenage girls huddled by the playground, gossiping about boys and the latest viral videos.   A strip mall nearby houses a sushi joint serving cheap eats, a swimming supply store, and a nail salon – a one-stop shop for pool parties and manicures.  There's also a frozen yogurt place, the DIY kind, where teens often gather, clutching cold cups of sugary goodness while they try out their latest skateboarding tricks and puff on vapes, convinced it makes them cool.   This neighborhood is pure Americana, a snapshot of the sleepy south where time seems to stand still.",
            "\"Where's everything?\" she asked as we drove past endless cornfields. I knew she'd be shocked by how empty it all seemed. She was from a town where you could walk to the grocery store in five minutes, she'd never seen this much open space before. Overwhelmed by the sea of corn, I told her about growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood who I was and where I came from.  We turned onto a two-lane country road, passing a quarry filled with water. Just past it was the small development where I live. Most of the houses are made of brick and stucco, each one with at least half an acre of land that everyone takes pride in keeping up. In the spring, flowers bloom everywhere, alongside the midwestern trees that change colors with each season. The driveways are always filled with fancy Mercedes-Benz cars, gleaming in the afternoon sun after a good wash.  \n\nAs we continued down the road towards my grey stucco house, my Korean neighbor was out in his yard, as always, with a friendly smile. He spends all day mowing his lawn, singing along to the hum of his mower. Everyone in the neighborhood finds it amusing, but he's a genuinely kind guy with a fascinating past. He's gotten older and his wit isn't what it used to be. Back in the day, he was a doctor, but now he mostly blends in with the grass and his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Finally, we reached my house. \n\nGeese wander the side yard, chased by our terrier. Out back, a small stream flows into the quarry. You can hear bullfrogs, the gentle gurgling of the stream, and the occasional \"moo\" from the nearby farms.  Across a handmade wooden bridge is a peaceful haven filled with trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was where I spent most of my childhood. Whether building tree forts or \"hunting\" (which mostly involved chasing critters), there was always something to do, and there was always a neighborhood friend around. \n\nThe winters in our small town can be really harsh, but they're also beautiful. The yard transforms from a lush green into a bare wilderness. The trees that once boasted vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers become just skeletons of bark. When it snows, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is covered with snow angels made by my little sister and snowmen.  My sister and I fought constantly as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapons of choice. We'd build massive igloo-like forts to store our \"arsenal\" of branches.  In our own little winter wonderland, we played pretend, lost in a world where nothing else mattered. We were just carefree kids.",
            "Portland, Oregon, has this thing about \"weird,\"  a vibe that's more than just a slogan painted on a building that somehow manages to be a pizza place, bar, music venue, and, well, let's just say it pushes the boundaries of legality. It's a place where the phrase \"Keep Portland Weird\" is like a rallying cry. \n\nSome see it as a nostalgic nod to the days when Portland was a hidden gem, less fancy and more affordable, where quirky subcultures thrived.  Others see it as an invitation: come to Portland, where being different isn't just accepted, it's celebrated.  \n\nEven with the influx of folks from California and all the new condos popping up, Portland still holds onto its weirdness.  It's not about blindly accepting everything, but it's about embracing the unconventional. We've got our share of modern conveniences and dramas, just like everywhere else. We buy our stuff from China, have yoga studios, and yes, even hipsters. Maybe \"weird\" just means we take things a little less seriously.\n\nTake my neighborhood, for example. It's full of colorful houses, front yards bursting with flowers, herbs, and veggies, and these magical things called \"free boxes\" that show up in the summer. These aren't your average cardboard boxes; they're treasure troves, filled with everything from clothes and books to who-knows-what. You never know what you'll find, but it's always a surprise.\n\nThat sense of wonder, that magic of discovery, that's what Portland is all about, at least to me. But there are a million ways to be weird in Portland, a million different flavors of \"unique.\" You've got people going to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real goats!), cheering on the Timbers soccer team, or simply embracing the weirdness in their own way.\n\nPortland is a city full of dreamers, people chasing their passions, or at least daydreaming about it over a pint at the local pub.  We've got our problems, sure. Drug addiction is a real issue, stemming from deeper mental health struggles, and the endless rain doesn't exactly help. Homelessness is another challenge, with a complex web of causes and no easy solutions.  The non-homeless population grapples with feelings of compassion and frustration, just like everywhere else.  But even with those struggles, Portland remains true to its heart, a place where being different is not just tolerated, it's celebrated.",
            "The mountains are always there, like silent guardians in the north, watching the sun rise and set every day.  No matter how busy I get, how lost in work or life, they're still there, strong and steady, unfazed by everything else. On days when stress is at its peak, they seem to call out to me, and when I turn to them, they offer a sense of peace and strength to carry on.\n\nI first fell for this place when I started college. The mountains north of campus were what truly captivated me. Sure, the university itself has its own beauty – the buildings, the ponds, the trees – all hold a special place in my heart. But the mountains reign supreme.\n\nThe town itself is charming in its own right. There are countless cafés where I spent countless hours fueled by caffeine and study sessions. A short walk or bus ride takes you to the downtown area, where the old, faded brick buildings create an atmosphere of history and vibrancy, almost as bustling as the nearby city.  But it's a short journey back to the quiet small-town feel, just past the library. This blend of urban energy and peaceful suburbs gives the town a unique charm, inviting exploration and making it easy to create lasting memories.\n\nThere are good memories, like walking past the rusty swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter, or sprinting through the busy downtown to catch a movie at the fancy theater thanks to a student discount. But there are also tough memories, because every place holds those too. The ponds, in particular, have been both a place of reflection and a spot for late-night existential crises. I've spent many a night there, watching turtles, ducks, and insects go about their lives, contemplating my own purpose in the face of life's mysteries.\n\nOne day, I was walking past the pond, the park, and the typical suburban houses, until I reached the main street. The sun was shining brightly on the palm trees, painting the sky in hues of blue and yellow. As I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was heading north. There they were, as they always had been – the majestic mountains, towering over everything else, silently reminding me to keep going.",
            "Alright, so you're thinking of checking out Bensonhurst, Brooklyn? Finding it won't be a problem, trust me. Public transport's pretty much the go-to in NYC, and Bensonhurst's a classic city neighborhood. You'll definitely feel that New York vibe.  \n\nGet ready for a serious dose of Asian shops everywhere you look. The neighborhood's been welcoming a ton of Asian folks over the last couple of decades, so you'll practically stumble into an Asian-owned store every block. Supermarkets and laundromats are like the kings of this neighborhood, and honestly, they're a hit with locals too. The food in the supermarkets is amazing, prices are super reasonable, and let's be real, convenience is key. I'm talking four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute stroll from where I am! Grocery shopping?  A breeze.\n\nNow, don't get me wrong, Bensonhurst isn't just an Asian enclave. It's a melting pot, with immigrants, first-gen and second-gen Americans all hanging out.  Most of the big businesses are Asian-owned, but there's also a recently revamped park nearby with a ton to offer: basketball courts, soccer and baseball fields, handball courts, swings, a playground, even a water fountain for the little ones. You'll see all walks of life mixing it up in the park, just like the rest of NYC.\n\nCorporate giants aren't really Bensonhurst's thing. Mostly, you'll find co-op buildings and condos, but two-family houses are the real MVPs here. The people are generally friendly, though they can be a bit loud.  Think cars blasting music, revving engines that'll wake you up at the crack of dawn.  \n\nIf you're visiting at night, stay aware of your surroundings.  Bensonhurst is safe enough, but you know how it is in any big city – people can be unpredictable.  You might encounter some troublemakers, bullies, or even petty thieves. I've had some run-ins with bullies in the past (physical assault, back when I was younger), and recently, there have been some package thefts. \n\nAnd one last thing – dog owners, please clean up after your pets!  Despite the fines in NYC, seemingly nobody here follows the rules. You'll be dodging dog waste left and right on your way to the train station or the supermarket. It's my biggest pet peeve!  Watch your step, and keep those shoes clean!",
            "My neighborhood is perched on a steep hill, the highest point everyone calls \"workout hill\" due to the runners who tackle it daily.  Sidewalks are a rare commodity here, so everyone walks right on the road, a bumpy path pockmarked with divots and patched wires. Rain and storms are frequent visitors, battering the power lines with branches and debris.  The constant repairs leave them looking like a haphazard patchwork.  Towering evergreen trees blanket the landscape, but locals seem to despise them, striving to cut them down for an unobstructed ocean view. This explains the abundance of houses perched high on the hill, boasting large glass-fronted second stories that frame the bay. Sunsets are breathtaking, with the water glowing from below and the sky ablaze with orange hues. However, the frequent overcast days mean most sunlight filters through a hazy veil, leaving most days damp and shrouded in mist.  Everything succumbs to moss: roofs, cars, railings, even my car sat in the driveway for a month and sprouted a thick green fuzz.\n\nDespite a school nearby, kids are scarce. The neighborhood is dominated by retirees, with dogs replacing children. They roam freely, often seen lounging in lawns or chasing each other down the street. Doors and windows better be kept shut, or you might find a furry intruder snooping inside. I once had one waltz into my living room – not the best houseguest! Add to that the mischievous rabbits who dig up gardens and burrow into lawns, a source of amusement for my cats who have hunted most of them out.  We also have our share of birds: sparrows, hummingbirds, occasional hawks or eagles chased off by the neighborhood crows.  \n\nThere are no shops around, but a short hike downhill leads to waterfront restaurants serving up fresh seafood. The beach is limited, but the rocks along the shore offer endless fun for tossing into the water. The bay itself is narrow, with the opposite shore visible even through the mist on most days.",
            "Alright, so I live in this typical suburban place in a small town down South.  Picture it: a street connecting two major highways, which means more traffic than I'd prefer, but hey, at least it's not boring. It's a pretty quiet neighborhood though. People kinda stick around, so I know most of the folks here. Everyone's busy with their lawn care and regular stuff, you know, the usual. In the winter, we crank up the sledding down the hill on our street. We're on the corner, so we see everyone coming and going.  We even keep track of the different cars that drive by.  If a strange vehicle rolls through, we definitely notice it.  Some neighbors like to walk for exercise or walk their dogs. Kids are out on their bikes, just your standard neighborhood scene. We work from home, so we're around a lot. It's the four of us: my wife, me, and our two daughters, who are eleven and fourteen.  Guess everyone else is used to seeing us around too.  We get outside and play, even in the rain sometimes.  We fire up the grill on the back deck every once in a while, and the smell of barbecue just fills the air. It seems like someone's always mowing the lawn around here. You can hear that lawnmower droning pretty much every day from spring to fall, when the grass finally chills out. We've got a ton of trees around us, because the area used to be all woods, so there's plenty of shade.  But that means a whole lot of leaves in the fall, which means raking and burning. I actually kind of love the smell of burning leaves, so that's a good sign that fall is here.  We haven't really had much of a winter lately, so it feels like fall just keeps going and going. Our garage is in the back, so we practically never use the front door unless someone knocks, which isn't often. I like to tinker with my truck or other projects in the garage, and when the garage doors are open, it's like I'm more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays are pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving brings some out-of-town relatives, so there are extra cars everywhere for a bit. It's the same for Mother's Day and Christmas. Overall, I dig it here. If it weren't for the through-street traffic, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is smack-dab in the middle of the high desert – think dirt, dirt, and more dirt. Unless you've actually lived here, you probably can't grasp the feeling of constantly seeing brown. And when you do see a lawn, you know that person is shelling out a small fortune to keep it that way. Back in the 90s when I first moved here, houses were spread out like stars in the night sky. Now, it's still pretty spread out, but there are tons of new additions popping up everywhere. Honestly, it's getting more and more city-like every day, but I guess that's happening everywhere these days.  \n\nMost of the people here are super friendly, just like in any city, there are good parts and bad parts. I'm surrounded by friendly old folks in my neighborhood, so I guess it's a pretty decent place to live.  \n\nWhen it comes to shopping, it's mostly chains like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you're looking for anything upscale, you've gotta hit the road. I don't see any Whole Foods or anything like that around here.\n\nBased on what I see, the most common jobs in town are in construction. I think it's because this city is still developing – there's a ton of open space left to build on.  That kinda freaks me out, though. I like things the way they are now. I left a big city, and I'm not itching to go back.\n\nSpeaking of construction, that's where my full-time gig is – I'm a drywall and T-bar installer. \n\nWhat I love about living here is the wildlife. People come here for all sorts of reasons, but the stark beauty of the desert is a big draw. The climate and landscape have created these challenging ecosystems that need protection. They're home to all sorts of cool creatures. It's important for us humans to learn about our wild neighbors so we can coexist peacefully. My family and I have adjusted really well to the wildlife. My three kids are obsessed with lizards and desert bugs. Right now, they're out there trying to catch some specimens. \n\nAs for tourist attractions, we've got a few. Victorville is a great place for families to experience the desert. It's a different kind of experience, for sure. If you're planning a visit, try to time it with the San Bernardino County Fair. It's a blast. Also, check out Wrightwood nearby – you can see the snow-covered mountains and even take some winter sports lessons.\n\nIf you're interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert, the Victor Valley Museum is worth a visit. They've got geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of Victorville's development.",
            "Okay, so when people ask about my neighborhood, it's a bit different than theirs, I reckon. Most folks probably picture a bunch of houses and families, right? Well, my \"hood\" is the college campus I live on. My dorm mates are my crew, and the whole campus is my stomping ground.  \n\nSure, it's not your typical neighborhood, but it's got the usual stuff: places to live, people, shops, and even a park. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, the digs. We've got apartments, regular houses rented out to alumni, and, of course, the dorms where most of us undergrads hang. Apartments usually have a few folks per room, maybe 20 or so in a building. Houses are rarer, mostly for alumni, and then there's the dorms, packed with hundreds of students, two to a room. \n\nThen there's the people. My school's all about diversity, so my neighborhood's a melting pot. You've got folks from all walks of life, all ages, all backgrounds.  The staff lives in the houses, newer students are in the dorms, and the older ones usually snag apartments. \n\nThere's too much to say about the people, so let's skip to the good stuff: the shops and the park! My campus is pretty self-contained, so we've got our own food joints, clothes stores, even a grocery store.  And the park? It's everyone's hangout, always clean and safe, thanks to all of us looking out for each other.",
            "Okay, so I've been living here for about 10 years now, so I think I have a pretty good handle on the place. When I first moved here from Riverdale to Stockbridge, I gotta admit, I was bummed out. I missed my old neighborhood and everyone in it, but my folks wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we made the switch for better housing, a better school, the whole \"not ghetto\" deal. \n\nOver the years, I got used to it. I made some new friends, some not-so-friendly faces too, but hey, that's life, right?  I never really clicked with most of the neighbors, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis for a while, since they lived right next door. They're cool people, almost like family, and I'm genuinely grateful to have them. \n\nI remember when my family went to Mr. Glen's wedding – they got remarried!  It was a blast, a total party, and something I'm looking forward to someday when I'm all settled down with a wife of my own. I even caught the little white strap off his wife, Ms. Veda's leg when she tossed it! Sadly, I missed the bouquet. We danced the night away, and I had a great time hanging with Marsharii, one of their daughters. Haven't seen her since, but I hope she's doing well.\n\nThis neighborhood is like a maze, honestly, but now that I have GPS, I'm thinking about exploring it more.  So far, my explorations have mostly been with my buddies Kason and Curtis, back when we were into video games and just living it up. Sometimes I'd chill out at the park, enjoying the peace and quiet. It really calms me down, gives me a sense of serenity. I'll even bring some sticks from Home Depot and practice my balance, sometimes even my bokken wooden sword.  \n\nThere's a basketball and tennis court too, although I haven't played in ages. Still, it's nice to have them there just in case I get the urge to pick up a racket or a ball again. My dad got me and my best friend into tennis with Mr. Graves back in the day. We had a blast, and they pushed us hard, but it was always fun. \n\nLooking back, I've had a lot of good times in this neighborhood. There are tons of stories, but these are the ones that really stick with me.  I have a feeling the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is pretty sweet because it's right by my college. It's mostly apartments, but there are some decent, affordable bars and restaurants around. One bar just got a fancy makeover and jacked up its prices, but it's not *that* bad. Most people here are either students or just scraping by since the apartments aren't exactly luxurious. There are tons of kids around because of the elementary school a stone's throw away. I don't really know my neighbors, and honestly, I'm good with that. They're pretty heavy into the weed, so the building management put this ridiculous air freshener thing right outside their door. It's hilarious, almost insulting. \n\nThe buildings around here are mostly old-school, but some have been renovated inside. There are some brand-new apartments down the street, but I can't stand them. They're cheaply built and super expensive, a total scam because they're near campus. They get away with it because, well, they're near campus. There's this cheap-ass restaurant a few minutes away that serves everything on paper plates and microwaves most of the food. Across the street is a gas station that supposedly has terrible working conditions. But hey, at least the road was redone last summer with city money. Now there's a nice sidewalk, some greenery, and it actually looks decent. \n\nMy building is surrounded by trees, though they chopped down a few. There's a whole tree line behind the complex, and then another set of apartments. I'm on 42nd street, but behind me is 43rd, which is rougher. The sidewalks are falling apart, the buildings look dingy, and the whole vibe is off. They've got lots of trees there too, probably to hide the buildings. A lot of the crime in the area seems to be concentrated in one apartment complex on 43rd, though I wouldn't blame them entirely. The apartments across the street from me have a pretty high turnover rate and their share of problems too. \n\nBut overall, I'm pretty happy with where I live. It's affordable, convenient, and I'm within walking distance of the university. Plus, there are two bus stops nearby, so getting to the store or downtown is easy peasy.",
            "My neighborhood is a collection of duplexes arranged on a cul-de-sac, spaced out to look like individual houses. They all share the same yellow paint, white porches, and green metal roofs, giving them a uniform look.  Most of the residents know each other well and often gather at the ends of driveways in the evenings. While the kids play, the adults chat and enjoy the simple pleasures of community life. It's a refreshing escape from the constant buzz of technology and feels like stepping back in time.  \n\nWe're surrounded by fields, trees, and endless blue skies, but lately, we've been dealing with some stormy weather. This season has brought tornado warnings, and last night, we even heard the sirens. I found myself huddled in my bathtub with my smallest dog, my purse, and a few pillows, while my other dog nervously paced the living room.  The storm unleashed a barrage of hail, and afterward, the ground steamed from the sudden temperature drop. It went from a scorching 92 degrees to a cool 75 in just minutes. The hail melted instantly upon hitting the hot pavement. \n\nAfter the storm passed, a double rainbow appeared in the clearing sky. I rushed to grab my camera and snapped some pictures to share with my loved ones. It was a breathtaking sight, and the neighborhood remained quiet for another hour before people started trickling back home. Life returned to normal, with parents and kids outside enjoying the evening air as dinner cooked.  \n\nMy new neighborhood in North Carolina is a wonderful place to live. Even though we all have similar two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartments, the interiors vary, with some being surprisingly small.  I love taking walks in the large field behind my apartment and heading down to the pond, where I've seen deer and hear the booming call of a giant bullfrog each morning. It's a peaceful retreat just forty minutes outside of Charlotte.  \n\nEvery morning is greeted by the sound of roosters crowing from nearby farms, making it feel like living in a small, close-knit village. Even the local donkey braying in the evening adds to the charm.  I feel incredibly lucky to have found this hidden gem of a neighborhood.",
            "Moving into this neighborhood right before eighth grade was a bit rough at first. Making friends took some time, but I eventually became close with a couple of guys – one lives two houses down and the other on my street. They've since moved, but those memories stick with me.  Most of the folks who were here when I first moved are still around. It's a pretty typical American suburb, full of two-story houses. Weekends, or any time the weather's nice, you can hear kids playing outside. It's pretty quiet most days, though. I've never had any issues with anyone here. You're pretty much left to your own devices unless you need something, which is cool. I've ordered tons of stuff online and never had a package disappear from my porch. I trust my neighbors.\n\nThere's a park just a couple minutes from my house, loaded with memories. Played basketball, football, baseball there with the neighborhood crew. Even got a nasty elbow to the nose playing football, but the good times definitely outweigh the bad. Now, when I go, it's mostly to hang with my cousin's kids. They're way younger than me and still into swings and slides and that kinda stuff. Just thinking about the park gets them pumped! It's pretty nostalgic for me now, for a bunch of reasons.\n\nThe neighborhood's pretty diverse, with all kinds of food options nearby. Within a mile, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian – the works. Though, these days, a lot of people just use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for delivery. The usual suspects are the fast food chains, which you can find anywhere in the suburbs, and there are tons of pizza places too.  The stores here have everything you could need. Plenty of dry cleaners, a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street, even a Jewel-Osco grocery store, a Midwest staple. There's even an Indian-owned store if you're in the mood for homemade or ready-made Indian food.\n\nOverall, I dig my neighborhood. Reading about other people's nightmare neighbors on social media and the news makes me appreciate mine even more.",
            "My town, Johnston, isn't exactly a standout in South Carolina. It's just your average, run-of-the-mill town, but it's got this big claim to fame: it's the \"Peach Capital of the World.\" You'll see it plastered on the welcome sign, and it's pretty much true.  The whole place is basically one giant peach orchard or cattle ranch.  \n\nThe houses are spread out, mostly two-story affairs with either metal roofs or gray shingles, probably to deal with the scorching summer heat. They're usually tucked back from the road, giving way to fields for animals or crops. The heart of town is pretty small, with just one stoplight at a four-way intersection. That's where you'll find the only stores in town. \n\nYou've got your usual fast food options: Hong Kong, a tiny Chinese spot run by a family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a local burger chain. Sadly, the pizza place closed down recently. There's a little family pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, known more for their Cherry Coca-Cola than anything else. And then there's IGA, the only grocery store but it's kind of pricey, so most people head to Walmart in the next town over for groceries. The real star of the show is Dollar General – it's always packed with folks grabbing everyday essentials.\n\nThere's also Possibilities Furniture & More, a charming little store run by a local legend. They even have movers who'll deliver your furniture! Attached to the furniture store is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet groomer that does it all: daycare, boarding, grooming, the works. \n\nThe doctor's office and the vet are both tucked away from the main drag, but they're well-equipped to take care of the town's needs. There's just one elementary school, Johnston Elementary. After fifth grade, kids have to head to the next town for middle and high school. \n\nParks? Well, they're working on a 2.5-acre park, but for now, there aren't really any. No movie theaters, bowling alleys, or places to hang out. It's pretty quiet here. But hey, it's a nice place to live, small enough to be overlooked.",
            "My first encounter with my current neighborhood came through a podcast about missing people, which was a bit of a shock. I mean, rents here are sky-high, often exceeding a thousand dollars a month.  It was surprising to learn about this story, as neither I nor any of my friends had ever heard of it. Maybe it's the struggle of making ends meet that makes these things happen. I know some friends who have tough nights, crying themselves to sleep because of the cost of living. Things are expensive, but we've become masters of frugality over the years. We've learned to appreciate the charm of dusty flea market treasures and moth-eaten clothes. As we age, we tend to smell less, perhaps because we're more used to the way things are. But the flea market always holds its own. The smell of adulthood for me is a mix of dusty magazines piled on a closed piano, lingering in the leather even after washing it. \n\nSpeaking of flea markets, there are three thrift stores within walking distance here. Starting from one end, you can visit two charity shops, a library, a rare book store, and a quirky curio shop. Downtown is bustling with cars and people every morning, but the thrift stores are peaceful sanctuaries. No matter how many people or vehicles pass by, there's a hush inside. It's a perfect place to lose yourself for an afternoon. Every year, the city seems to get denser, with more cars and people. They call it a developing city, a place where one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery is headquartered. It's still growing, showing signs of those growing pains. It reminds me of New York City – everyone's focused on their own goals, and there's not much expectation of anything from anyone else. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will respect your space. It's not like the South, where showing a little concern is seen as genuine care. People here don't pry into your life. You can keep your guard up as long as you like, and the city rolls on, like waves on a beach. It's a lively place to be. \n\nBetween the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something happening. In a way, we're less like strangers in an apartment building and more like a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and support each other when we can. I feel fortunate to be here. I like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I make an effort to keep my space clean and leave them food, and they do the same for me. I bring them their mail, and they bring me mine. It's nice to see them, and I believe they enjoy my company as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, impersonal modernist sprawl, but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I haven't completely messed up my life.",
            "So, where I live is like, your basic, everyday suburb, y'know?  There's a homeowner's association here that's *really* into keeping things looking neat and tidy.  Driving around, you'll see rows and rows of identical houses, all perfectly manicured lawns, a sprinkle of decorative rocks, and tiny driveways.  Every once in a while, there's a small tree trying to break up the monotony, and two-car garages are the norm. The roads are always freshly paved, which is nice, but kinda boring.  I mean, you won't find any potholes or anything, but it's all just...predictable. Most of the houses are one story, but a few have two. And the mail situation?  Forget those individual mailboxes you see everywhere else – we've got a huge communal box at the end of the street, like an apartment building.  Key required, of course.  Gotta keep things uniform, right?\n\nMy place is kind of on the edge of the city, so it's kinda like a mix of rural and suburban.  We've got tons of space, which is cool. There are a bunch of community pools – gated and well-maintained – and walking trails everywhere.  You don't even need to go to a park to get your steps in.  The neighborhood's mostly made up of retired folks, so it's super safe and everyone knows each other.  There are a few younger folks and middle-aged professionals mixed in, but not many.  \n\nThe city itself is pretty big, population-wise, but it still feels like a small town.  We've got all the basic stuff you need, like a mall – not huge, but it does the trick. It takes about 15 minutes to get anywhere decent though.  We've got everything from fancy organic grocery stores to bargain outlets with half the staff and twice the dusty shelves. Overall, it's a pretty standard, safe, and well-kept neighborhood.",
            "My town's kinda like that quiet cousin of a bigger city. It's got a small-town feel, but you're close enough to the city stuff if you need it. My part of town, on the east side, isn't the fanciest.  Houses are older, mostly rentals, and you know, sometimes things go missing from porches if you're not careful.  But it's not a bad place. Folks are friendly, wave when you walk by, and crime, while it happens, isn't anything crazy. There have been some rough incidents, shootings a few blocks over, even a homicide. We lost a neighbor’s son to a shooting last year, which was tough. But overall, we're lucky - nothing major has ever directly hit home.\n\nThe whole opioid thing has been a big weight on our town, like everywhere else.  We've lost people, but there are a lot of good resources trying to fight it - rehab centers, Narcan training, that kind of thing.\n\nBut hey, there are good things here too. My son’s school is amazing, from the teachers to the staff. He’s got special needs, but they make him feel right at home. The school even gives free breakfast and lunch to all the kids because a lot of families struggle.  \n\nThe town's been trying to spruce itself up, but most of the work seems to be focused downtown, where the shops and traffic are. Our side gets a little forgotten, which can be frustrating.\n\nStill, we love it here. It’s our home. People are good, the school's great, we've got everything we need, and our house, well, it's comfortable. We've been here for 16 years, and we wouldn't trade it for the world.",
            "My neighborhood is a vibrant mix of history and character. It's nestled on a hill, surrounded by buildings that whisper tales of the past. I live in a seven-story apartment building right across from an old theater, and just down the street, there's this awesome arcade bar that draws in all sorts of folks on warm summer evenings. On weekends, especially in June and July, you'll often see a line snaking out the door. A few blocks up is the local park, surprisingly spacious for this part of town. It's enclosed by concrete with these steep stairs built right into the wall. During the harsh winter months, you'll see homeless people setting up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and on those wide steps. Though it doesn't snow much, the heavy downpours in mid-winter can make staying warm a real struggle. By clustering their tents together, they find warmth and are close to the only family center for miles, where they can find a hot shower and a chance to freshen up. What I truly love about my city, though, isn't the beauty of its historical landmarks – the towering buildings, the architecture that climbs the hills rolling down to the ocean.  It's the spirit of the people.  Hilltop used to be notorious for gang violence on the West Coast, and even today, stories from those days, when federal agents and the DEA would swoop in, echo through the neighborhood. The people here remember. These stories are passed down through generations, even to newcomers like me. Despite still being considered a rough area, the residents work hard to keep it clean and safe. They care deeply about their community. There are warnings about not walking around alone at night if you're white, but I think those are echoes of the past, a remnant of old prejudices. Maybe it's because I'm dark enough to pass as something other than a \"white girl,\" or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of their own, someone who understands the constant reminders of racism and social conditioning that plague our nation. Even in a city that prides itself on being a melting pot of cultures. One thing is for sure: no matter where I go, Hilltop will always be home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, encountering people who offer me a jacket more readily than a threat. It's a place where laundromat owners stay open late so I can charge my phone when caught in a downpour. It's a place where I've sat, feeling invisible, huddled against store fronts on the bleakest nights, only to have someone stop, look me in the eye, hand me five dollars, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I call home a slice of Rural America, tucked away in a small town in Michigan. You'll find no towering skyscrapers or sprawling shopping centers here – no Walmart, Target, not even an Applebee's in sight. You've gotta hit the road to get anything you need. Despite the lack of big-city amenities, I wouldn't trade this place for the world. It's surrounded by breathtaking water: Lake Michigan on one side, Lake Charlevoix on the other.  Beaches are practically everywhere you turn, perfect for dipping your toes and soaking up the sun.\n\nMy neighborhood is straight out of a quintessential small town picture book. Homes aren't crammed together, each one unique, some sporting a modern makeover, others proudly showcasing their age.  Most have full basements, visible from the street, and a kaleidoscope of colors adorns the aluminum siding of many. Yards are plentiful, bursting with life – trampolines bouncing, kids' playsets whirring, gardens flourishing, and fences keeping furry friends safe. It's a community of hard-working folks, raising families or cherishing the memories they've made.\n\nYou'll see kids zooming down sidewalks, dogs getting their daily walk, and neighbors cycling or rollerblading. There's a real sense of belonging here, a knowing glance exchanged between those who call this place home and those who are just passing through.  The air hums with the friendly chatter of neighbors grilling outside, a wave here, a smile there. Lawns are manicured with pride, free from fallen leaves and overgrown weeds.  \n\nIt's not about flashy homes, but about creating a sense of community, a place where families thrive. The quiet streets, the friendly faces, the feeling of safety – these are the things that make this neighborhood special. It's a place where you can let your guard down, knowing that you're among friends. \n\nThe county sheriff's department and jail are within walking distance, a reassuring presence in the community.  The health department is right next door, and the city recycling center is just down the road, a testament to the town's commitment to sustainability. \n\nBaseball and softball games echo through the air, the announcer's voice painting vivid pictures of the players' triumphs.  The small town airport, a stone's throw away, adds a little bit of excitement to the day with the rumble of small planes taking off and landing.  A local ice cream parlor is within easy reach, and a short bike ride takes you to the park, where kids can run free.\n\nIt might not be a glamorous place, but it's home. It's a place where life moves at a slower pace, where neighbors become friends, and where you can truly feel a sense of belonging."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "My neighborhood in this massive city is a real melting pot.  Residential areas pop up randomly between all these businesses - offices, shops, restaurants, you name it. There's always something new to try, whether it's a fancy restaurant or a quirky little boutique.  Big brands definitely have their place, but these independent shops are gaining popularity, popping up in malls and lining the streets, bringing a touch of excitement to what would otherwise be quiet neighborhoods.  And speaking of excitement, there are a couple of parks nearby that are always bustling with families.  \n\nThis diversity extends to the people too. We've got a big LGBTQ+ community, a thriving Orthodox Jewish community, and a bunch of folks who've moved here from the former Soviet Union, all in one small area.  Venture a bit further out, and you'll find even more cultures represented.  It's like a mini United Nations with \"Korea Town,\" \"China Town,\" \"Little Armenia,\" and so many more, all just a short (or long, depending on traffic) drive away.  Speaking of traffic, this city is notorious for it.  Even a 10-mile journey can easily take two hours during rush hour.  Walking isn't really an option, since the city is massive and people are glued to their cars.  Which, ironically, leads to the city being choked with cars and parking being a nightmare. \n\nAdding to the chaos, they're constantly building new apartment buildings, which is great for newcomers but makes existing residents groan at the thought of even more people and traffic.

            "My neighborhood is a bit of a time capsule, a snapshot of a bygone era. Most of the houses are single-family dwellings, some split into two while still attached, creating a unique kind of clustered intimacy. My place has a small front yard and a tiny driveway – a picture of suburban normalcy that once embodied the American dream.  \n\nThere's a bittersweet nostalgia hanging in the air. While the dream feels a bit distant now, the houses still whisper of a time when things were simpler, when the dream felt more attainable. People aren't as optimistic as they used to be, the yards aren't as manicured, but there are still cars in every driveway, and kids playing like the world revolves around their games. The old public school, standing strong after almost 90 years, seems to promise a future to the young while stirring memories in the older folks. \n\nThe churches are mostly empty, but the basketball courts are always buzzing.

The karate school, once a hub of youthful aspirations, is now a pharmacy – reflecting a shift in priorities. \n\nEven the old movie theater, showing classic films at bargain prices, still draws crowds, mostly the older residents who appreciate a night out without the distractions of the latest releases. The expressway cuts through the town next door, a constant reminder of the outside world, a world that the town elders, with their yearning for a simpler time, have actively kept at bay. They ultimately blocked the petition for a local exit, fearing it would disrupt the town's tranquility.  A new high school is being built, and the town is debating a mascot. My vote?

            "Portland, Oregon, has this thing about \"weird,\"  a vibe that's more than just a slogan painted on a building that somehow manages to be a pizza place, bar, music venue, and, well, let's just say it pushes the boundaries of legality. It's a place where the phrase \"Keep Portland Weird\" is like a rallying cry. \n\nSome see it as a nostalgic nod to the days when Portland was a hidden gem, less fancy and more affordable, where quirky subcultures thrived.  Others see it as an invitation: come to Portland, where being different isn't just accepted, it's celebrated.  \n\nEven with the influx of folks from California and all the new condos popping up, Portland still holds onto its weirdness.  It's not about blindly accepting everything, but it's about embracing the unconventional. We've got our share of modern conveniences and dramas, just like everywhere else. We buy our stuff from China, have yoga studios, and yes, even hipsters. Maybe \"weird\" just means we take things a little less seriously.\n\nTake my neighborhood, for example. It's full of colorful houses, front yards bursting with flowers, herbs, and veggies, and these magical things called \"free boxes\" that show up in the summer. These aren't your average cardboard boxes; they're treasure troves, filled with everything from clothes and books to who-knows-what. You never know what you'll find, but it's always a surprise.\n\nThat sense of wonder, that magic of discovery, that's what Portland is all about, at least to me. But there are a million ways to be weird in Portland, a million different flavors of \"unique.\" You've got people going to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real goats!), cheering on the Timbers soccer team, or simply embracing the weirdness in their own way.\n\nPortland is a city full of dreamers, people chasing their passions, or at least daydreaming about it over a pint at the local pub.  We've got our problems, sure. Drug addiction is a real issue, stemming from deeper mental health struggles, and the endless rain doesn't exactly help. Homelessness is another challenge, with a complex web of causes and no easy solutions.  The non-homeless population grapples with feelings of compassion and frustration, just like everywhere else.  But even with those struggles, Portland remains true to its heart, a place where being different is not just tolerated, it's celebrated.",
            "The mountains are always there, like silent guardians in the north, watching the sun rise and set every day.  No matter how busy I get, how lost in work or life, they're still there, strong and steady, unfazed by everything else. On days when stress is at its peak, they seem to call out to me, and when I turn to them, they offer a sense of peace and strength to carry on.\n\nI first fell for this place when I started college. The mountains north of campus were what truly captivated me. Sure, the university itself has its own beauty – the buildings, the ponds, the trees – all hold a special place in my heart. But the mountains reign supreme.\n\nThe town itself is charming in its own right. There are countless cafés where I spent countless hours fueled by caffeine and study sessions. A short walk or bus ride takes you to the downtown area, where the old, faded brick buildings create an atmosphere of history and vibrancy, almost as bustling as the nearby city.  But it's a short journey back to the quiet small-town feel, just past the library. This blend of urban energy and peaceful suburbs gives the town a unique charm, inviting exploration and making it easy to create lasting memories.\n\nThere are good memories, like walking past the rusty swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter, or sprinting through the busy downtown to catch a movie at the fancy theater thanks to a student discount. But there are also tough memories, because every place holds those too. The ponds, in particular, have been both a place of reflection and a spot for late-night existential crises. I've spent many a night there, watching turtles, ducks, and insects go about their lives, contemplating my own purpose in the face of life's mysteries.\n\nOne day, I was walking past the pond, the park, and the typical suburban houses, until I reached the main street. The sun was shining brightly on the palm trees, painting the sky in hues of blue and yellow. As I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was heading north. There they were, as they always had been – the majestic mountains, towering over everything else, silently reminding me to keep going.",
            "Alright, so you're thinking of checking out Bensonhurst, Brooklyn? Finding it won't be a problem, trust me. Public transport's pretty much the go-to in NYC, and Bensonhurst's a classic city neighborhood. You'll definitely feel that New York vibe.  \n\nGet ready for a serious dose of Asian shops everywhere you look. The neighborhood's been welcoming a ton of Asian folks over the last couple of decades, so you'll practically stumble into an Asian-owned store every block. Supermarkets and laundromats are like the kings of this neighborhood, and honestly, they're a hit with locals too. The food in the supermarkets is amazing, prices are super reasonable, and let's be real, convenience is key. I'm talking four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute stroll from where I am! Grocery shopping?  A breeze.\n\nNow, don't get me wrong, Bensonhurst isn't just an Asian enclave. It's a melting pot, with immigrants, first-gen and second-gen Americans all hanging out.  Most of the big businesses are Asian-owned, but there's also a recently revamped park nearby with a ton to offer: basketball courts, soccer and baseball fields, handball courts, swings, a playground, even a water fountain for the little ones. You'll see all walks of life mixing it up in the park, just like the rest of NYC.\n\nCorporate giants aren't really Bensonhurst's thing. Mostly, you'll find co-op buildings and condos, but two-family houses are the real MVPs here. The people are generally friendly, though they can be a bit loud.  Think cars blasting music, revving engines that'll wake you up at the crack of dawn.  \n\nIf you're visiting at night, stay aware of your surroundings.  Bensonhurst is safe enough, but you know how it is in any big city – people can be unpredictable.  You might encounter some troublemakers, bullies, or even petty thieves. I've had some run-ins with bullies in the past (physical assault, back when I was younger), and recently, there have been some package thefts. \n\nAnd one last thing – dog owners, please clean up after your pets!  Despite the fines in NYC, seemingly nobody here follows the rules. You'll be dodging dog waste left and right on your way to the train station or the supermarket. It's my biggest pet peeve!  Watch your step, and keep those shoes clean!",
            "My neighborhood is perched on a steep hill, the highest point everyone calls \"workout hill\" due to the runners who tackle it daily.  Sidewalks are a rare commodity here, so everyone walks right on the road, a bumpy path pockmarked with divots and patched wires. Rain and storms are frequent visitors, battering the power lines with branches and debris.  The constant repairs leave them looking like a haphazard patchwork.  Towering evergreen trees blanket the landscape, but locals seem to despise them, striving to cut them down for an unobstructed ocean view. This explains the abundance of houses perched high on the hill, boasting large glass-fronted second stories that frame the bay. Sunsets are breathtaking, with the water glowing from below and the sky ablaze with orange hues. However, the frequent overcast days mean most sunlight filters through a hazy veil, leaving most days damp and shrouded in mist.  Everything succumbs to moss: roofs, cars, railings, even my car sat in the driveway for a month and sprouted a thick green fuzz.\n\nDespite a school nearby, kids are scarce. The neighborhood is dominated by retirees, with dogs replacing children. They roam freely, often seen lounging in lawns or chasing each other down the street. Doors and windows better be kept shut, or you might find a furry intruder snooping inside. I once had one waltz into my living room – not the best houseguest! Add to that the mischievous rabbits who dig up gardens and burrow into lawns, a source of amusement for my cats who have hunted most of them out.  We also have our share of birds: sparrows, hummingbirds, occasional hawks or eagles chased off by the neighborhood crows.  \n\nThere are no shops around, but a short hike downhill leads to waterfront restaurants serving up fresh seafood. The beach is limited, but the rocks along the shore offer endless fun for tossing into the water. The bay itself is narrow, with the opposite shore visible even through the mist on most days.",
            "Alright, so I live in this typical suburban place in a small town down South.  Picture it: a street connecting two major highways, which means more traffic than I'd prefer, but hey, at least it's not boring. It's a pretty quiet neighborhood though. People kinda stick around, so I know most of the folks here. Everyone's busy with their lawn care and regular stuff, you know, the usual. In the winter, we crank up the sledding down the hill on our street. We're on the corner, so we see everyone coming and going.  We even keep track of the different cars that drive by.  If a strange vehicle rolls through, we definitely notice it.  Some neighbors like to walk for exercise or walk their dogs. Kids are out on their bikes, just your standard neighborhood scene. We work from home, so we're around a lot. It's the four of us: my wife, me, and our two daughters, who are eleven and fourteen.  Guess everyone else is used to seeing us around too.  We get outside and play, even in the rain sometimes.  We fire up the grill on the back deck every once in a while, and the smell of barbecue just fills the air. It seems like someone's always mowing the lawn around here. You can hear that lawnmower droning pretty much every day from spring to fall, when the grass finally chills out. We've got a ton of trees around us, because the area used to be all woods, so there's plenty of shade.  But that means a whole lot of leaves in the fall, which means raking and burning. I actually kind of love the smell of burning leaves, so that's a good sign that fall is here.  We haven't really had much of a winter lately, so it feels like fall just keeps going and going. Our garage is in the back, so we practically never use the front door unless someone knocks, which isn't often. I like to tinker with my truck or other projects in the garage, and when the garage doors are open, it's like I'm more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays are pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving brings some out-of-town relatives, so there are extra cars everywhere for a bit. It's the same for Mother's Day and Christmas. Overall, I dig it here. If it weren't for the through-street traffic, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is smack-dab in the middle of the high desert – think dirt, dirt, and more dirt. Unless you've actually lived here, you probably can't grasp the feeling of constantly seeing brown. And when you do see a lawn, you know that person is shelling out a small fortune to keep it that way. Back in the 90s when I first moved here, houses were spread out like stars in the night sky. Now, it's still pretty spread out, but there are tons of new additions popping up everywhere. Honestly, it's getting more and more city-like every day, but I guess that's happening everywhere these days.  \n\nMost of the people here are super friendly, just like in any city, there are good parts and bad parts. I'm surrounded by friendly old folks in my neighborhood, so I guess it's a pretty decent place to live.  \n\nWhen it comes to shopping, it's mostly chains like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you're looking for anything upscale, you've gotta hit the road. I don't see any Whole Foods or anything like that around here.\n\nBased on what I see, the most common jobs in town are in construction. I think it's because this city is still developing – there's a ton of open space left to build on.  That kinda freaks me out, though. I like things the way they are now. I left a big city, and I'm not itching to go back.\n\nSpeaking of construction, that's where my full-time gig is – I'm a drywall and T-bar installer. \n\nWhat I love about living here is the wildlife. People come here for all sorts of reasons, but the stark beauty of the desert is a big draw. The climate and landscape have created these challenging ecosystems that need protection. They're home to all sorts of cool creatures. It's important for us humans to learn about our wild neighbors so we can coexist peacefully. My family and I have adjusted really well to the wildlife. My three kids are obsessed with lizards and desert bugs. Right now, they're out there trying to catch some specimens. \n\nAs for tourist attractions, we've got a few. Victorville is a great place for families to experience the desert. It's a different kind of experience, for sure. If you're planning a visit, try to time it with the San Bernardino County Fair. It's a blast. Also, check out Wrightwood nearby – you can see the snow-covered mountains and even take some winter sports lessons.\n\nIf you're interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert, the Victor Valley Museum is worth a visit. They've got geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of Victorville's development.",
            "Okay, so when people ask about my neighborhood, it's a bit different than theirs, I reckon. Most folks probably picture a bunch of houses and families, right? Well, my \"hood\" is the college campus I live on. My dorm mates are my crew, and the whole campus is my stomping ground.  \n\nSure, it's not your typical neighborhood, but it's got the usual stuff: places to live, people, shops, and even a park. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, the digs. We've got apartments, regular houses rented out to alumni, and, of course, the dorms where most of us undergrads hang. Apartments usually have a few folks per room, maybe 20 or so in a building. Houses are rarer, mostly for alumni, and then there's the dorms, packed with hundreds of students, two to a room. \n\nThen there's the people. My school's all about diversity, so my neighborhood's a melting pot. You've got folks from all walks of life, all ages, all backgrounds.  The staff lives in the houses, newer students are in the dorms, and the older ones usually snag apartments. \n\nThere's too much to say about the people, so let's skip to the good stuff: the shops and the park! My campus is pretty self-contained, so we've got our own food joints, clothes stores, even a grocery store.  And the park? It's everyone's hangout, always clean and safe, thanks to all of us looking out for each other.",
            "Okay, so I've been living here for about 10 years now, so I think I have a pretty good handle on the place. When I first moved here from Riverdale to Stockbridge, I gotta admit, I was bummed out. I missed my old neighborhood and everyone in it, but my folks wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we made the switch for better housing, a better school, the whole \"not ghetto\" deal. \n\nOver the years, I got used to it. I made some new friends, some not-so-friendly faces too, but hey, that's life, right?  I never really clicked with most of the neighbors, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis for a while, since they lived right next door. They're cool people, almost like family, and I'm genuinely grateful to have them. \n\nI remember when my family went to Mr. Glen's wedding – they got remarried!  It was a blast, a total party, and something I'm looking forward to someday when I'm all settled down with a wife of my own. I even caught the little white strap off his wife, Ms. Veda's leg when she tossed it! Sadly, I missed the bouquet. We danced the night away, and I had a great time hanging with Marsharii, one of their daughters. Haven't seen her since, but I hope she's doing well.\n\nThis neighborhood is like a maze, honestly, but now that I have GPS, I'm thinking about exploring it more.  So far, my explorations have mostly been with my buddies Kason and Curtis, back when we were into video games and just living it up. Sometimes I'd chill out at the park, enjoying the peace and quiet. It really calms me down, gives me a sense of serenity. I'll even bring some sticks from Home Depot and practice my balance, sometimes even my bokken wooden sword.  \n\nThere's a basketball and tennis court too, although I haven't played in ages. Still, it's nice to have them there just in case I get the urge to pick up a racket or a ball again. My dad got me and my best friend into tennis with Mr. Graves back in the day. We had a blast, and they pushed us hard, but it was always fun. \n\nLooking back, I've had a lot of good times in this neighborhood. There are tons of stories, but these are the ones that really stick with me.  I have a feeling the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is pretty sweet because it's right by my college. It's mostly apartments, but there are some decent, affordable bars and restaurants around. One bar just got a fancy makeover and jacked up its prices, but it's not *that* bad. Most people here are either students or just scraping by since the apartments aren't exactly luxurious. There are tons of kids around because of the elementary school a stone's throw away. I don't really know my neighbors, and honestly, I'm good with that. They're pretty heavy into the weed, so the building management put this ridiculous air freshener thing right outside their door. It's hilarious, almost insulting. \n\nThe buildings around here are mostly old-school, but some have been renovated inside. There are some brand-new apartments down the street, but I can't stand them. They're cheaply built and super expensive, a total scam because they're near campus. They get away with it because, well, they're near campus. There's this cheap-ass restaurant a few minutes away that serves everything on paper plates and microwaves most of the food. Across the street is a gas station that supposedly has terrible working conditions. But hey, at least the road was redone last summer with city money. Now there's a nice sidewalk, some greenery, and it actually looks decent. \n\nMy building is surrounded by trees, though they chopped down a few. There's a whole tree line behind the complex, and then another set of apartments. I'm on 42nd street, but behind me is 43rd, which is rougher. The sidewalks are falling apart, the buildings look dingy, and the whole vibe is off. They've got lots of trees there too, probably to hide the buildings. A lot of the crime in the area seems to be concentrated in one apartment complex on 43rd, though I wouldn't blame them entirely. The apartments across the street from me have a pretty high turnover rate and their share of problems too. \n\nBut overall, I'm pretty happy with where I live. It's affordable, convenient, and I'm within walking distance of the university. Plus, there are two bus stops nearby, so getting to the store or downtown is easy peasy.",
            "My neighborhood is a collection of duplexes arranged on a cul-de-sac, spaced out to look like individual houses. They all share the same yellow paint, white porches, and green metal roofs, giving them a uniform look.  Most of the residents know each other well and often gather at the ends of driveways in the evenings. While the kids play, the adults chat and enjoy the simple pleasures of community life. It's a refreshing escape from the constant buzz of technology and feels like stepping back in time.  \n\nWe're surrounded by fields, trees, and endless blue skies, but lately, we've been dealing with some stormy weather. This season has brought tornado warnings, and last night, we even heard the sirens. I found myself huddled in my bathtub with my smallest dog, my purse, and a few pillows, while my other dog nervously paced the living room.  The storm unleashed a barrage of hail, and afterward, the ground steamed from the sudden temperature drop. It went from a scorching 92 degrees to a cool 75 in just minutes. The hail melted instantly upon hitting the hot pavement. \n\nAfter the storm passed, a double rainbow appeared in the clearing sky. I rushed to grab my camera and snapped some pictures to share with my loved ones. It was a breathtaking sight, and the neighborhood remained quiet for another hour before people started trickling back home. Life returned to normal, with parents and kids outside enjoying the evening air as dinner cooked.  \n\nMy new neighborhood in North Carolina is a wonderful place to live. Even though we all have similar two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartments, the interiors vary, with some being surprisingly small.  I love taking walks in the large field behind my apartment and heading down to the pond, where I've seen deer and hear the booming call of a giant bullfrog each morning. It's a peaceful retreat just forty minutes outside of Charlotte.  \n\nEvery morning is greeted by the sound of roosters crowing from nearby farms, making it feel like living in a small, close-knit village. Even the local donkey braying in the evening adds to the charm.  I feel incredibly lucky to have found this hidden gem of a neighborhood.",
            "Moving into this neighborhood right before eighth grade was a bit rough at first. Making friends took some time, but I eventually became close with a couple of guys – one lives two houses down and the other on my street. They've since moved, but those memories stick with me.  Most of the folks who were here when I first moved are still around. It's a pretty typical American suburb, full of two-story houses. Weekends, or any time the weather's nice, you can hear kids playing outside. It's pretty quiet most days, though. I've never had any issues with anyone here. You're pretty much left to your own devices unless you need something, which is cool. I've ordered tons of stuff online and never had a package disappear from my porch. I trust my neighbors.\n\nThere's a park just a couple minutes from my house, loaded with memories. Played basketball, football, baseball there with the neighborhood crew. Even got a nasty elbow to the nose playing football, but the good times definitely outweigh the bad. Now, when I go, it's mostly to hang with my cousin's kids. They're way younger than me and still into swings and slides and that kinda stuff. Just thinking about the park gets them pumped! It's pretty nostalgic for me now, for a bunch of reasons.\n\nThe neighborhood's pretty diverse, with all kinds of food options nearby. Within a mile, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian – the works. Though, these days, a lot of people just use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for delivery. The usual suspects are the fast food chains, which you can find anywhere in the suburbs, and there are tons of pizza places too.  The stores here have everything you could need. Plenty of dry cleaners, a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street, even a Jewel-Osco grocery store, a Midwest staple. There's even an Indian-owned store if you're in the mood for homemade or ready-made Indian food.\n\nOverall, I dig my neighborhood. Reading about other people's nightmare neighbors on social media and the news makes me appreciate mine even more.",
            "My town, Johnston, isn't exactly a standout in South Carolina. It's just your average, run-of-the-mill town, but it's got this big claim to fame: it's the \"Peach Capital of the World.\" You'll see it plastered on the welcome sign, and it's pretty much true.  The whole place is basically one giant peach orchard or cattle ranch.  \n\nThe houses are spread out, mostly two-story affairs with either metal roofs or gray shingles, probably to deal with the scorching summer heat. They're usually tucked back from the road, giving way to fields for animals or crops. The heart of town is pretty small, with just one stoplight at a four-way intersection. That's where you'll find the only stores in town. \n\nYou've got your usual fast food options: Hong Kong, a tiny Chinese spot run by a family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a local burger chain. Sadly, the pizza place closed down recently. There's a little family pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, known more for their Cherry Coca-Cola than anything else. And then there's IGA, the only grocery store but it's kind of pricey, so most people head to Walmart in the next town over for groceries. The real star of the show is Dollar General – it's always packed with folks grabbing everyday essentials.\n\nThere's also Possibilities Furniture & More, a charming little store run by a local legend. They even have movers who'll deliver your furniture! Attached to the furniture store is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet groomer that does it all: daycare, boarding, grooming, the works. \n\nThe doctor's office and the vet are both tucked away from the main drag, but they're well-equipped to take care of the town's needs. There's just one elementary school, Johnston Elementary. After fifth grade, kids have to head to the next town for middle and high school. \n\nParks? Well, they're working on a 2.5-acre park, but for now, there aren't really any. No movie theaters, bowling alleys, or places to hang out. It's pretty quiet here. But hey, it's a nice place to live, small enough to be overlooked.",
            "My first encounter with my current neighborhood came through a podcast about missing people, which was a bit of a shock. I mean, rents here are sky-high, often exceeding a thousand dollars a month.  It was surprising to learn about this story, as neither I nor any of my friends had ever heard of it. Maybe it's the struggle of making ends meet that makes these things happen. I know some friends who have tough nights, crying themselves to sleep because of the cost of living. Things are expensive, but we've become masters of frugality over the years. We've learned to appreciate the charm of dusty flea market treasures and moth-eaten clothes. As we age, we tend to smell less, perhaps because we're more used to the way things are. But the flea market always holds its own. The smell of adulthood for me is a mix of dusty magazines piled on a closed piano, lingering in the leather even after washing it. \n\nSpeaking of flea markets, there are three thrift stores within walking distance here. Starting from one end, you can visit two charity shops, a library, a rare book store, and a quirky curio shop. Downtown is bustling with cars and people every morning, but the thrift stores are peaceful sanctuaries. No matter how many people or vehicles pass by, there's a hush inside. It's a perfect place to lose yourself for an afternoon. Every year, the city seems to get denser, with more cars and people. They call it a developing city, a place where one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery is headquartered. It's still growing, showing signs of those growing pains. It reminds me of New York City – everyone's focused on their own goals, and there's not much expectation of anything from anyone else. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will respect your space. It's not like the South, where showing a little concern is seen as genuine care. People here don't pry into your life. You can keep your guard up as long as you like, and the city rolls on, like waves on a beach. It's a lively place to be. \n\nBetween the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something happening. In a way, we're less like strangers in an apartment building and more like a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and support each other when we can. I feel fortunate to be here. I like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I make an effort to keep my space clean and leave them food, and they do the same for me. I bring them their mail, and they bring me mine. It's nice to see them, and I believe they enjoy my company as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, impersonal modernist sprawl, but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I haven't completely messed up my life.",
            "So, where I live is like, your basic, everyday suburb, y'know?  There's a homeowner's association here that's *really* into keeping things looking neat and tidy.  Driving around, you'll see rows and rows of identical houses, all perfectly manicured lawns, a sprinkle of decorative rocks, and tiny driveways.  Every once in a while, there's a small tree trying to break up the monotony, and two-car garages are the norm. The roads are always freshly paved, which is nice, but kinda boring.  I mean, you won't find any potholes or anything, but it's all just...predictable. Most of the houses are one story, but a few have two. And the mail situation?  Forget those individual mailboxes you see everywhere else – we've got a huge communal box at the end of the street, like an apartment building.  Key required, of course.  Gotta keep things uniform, right?\n\nMy place is kind of on the edge of the city, so it's kinda like a mix of rural and suburban.  We've got tons of space, which is cool. There are a bunch of community pools – gated and well-maintained – and walking trails everywhere.  You don't even need to go to a park to get your steps in.  The neighborhood's mostly made up of retired folks, so it's super safe and everyone knows each other.  There are a few younger folks and middle-aged professionals mixed in, but not many.  \n\nThe city itself is pretty big, population-wise, but it still feels like a small town.  We've got all the basic stuff you need, like a mall – not huge, but it does the trick. It takes about 15 minutes to get anywhere decent though.  We've got everything from fancy organic grocery stores to bargain outlets with half the staff and twice the dusty shelves. Overall, it's a pretty standard, safe, and well-kept neighborhood.",
            "My town's kinda like that quiet cousin of a bigger city. It's got a small-town feel, but you're close enough to the city stuff if you need it. My part of town, on the east side, isn't the fanciest.  Houses are older, mostly rentals, and you know, sometimes things go missing from porches if you're not careful.  But it's not a bad place. Folks are friendly, wave when you walk by, and crime, while it happens, isn't anything crazy. There have been some rough incidents, shootings a few blocks over, even a homicide. We lost a neighbor’s son to a shooting last year, which was tough. But overall, we're lucky - nothing major has ever directly hit home.\n\nThe whole opioid thing has been a big weight on our town, like everywhere else.  We've lost people, but there are a lot of good resources trying to fight it - rehab centers, Narcan training, that kind of thing.\n\nBut hey, there are good things here too. My son’s school is amazing, from the teachers to the staff. He’s got special needs, but they make him feel right at home. The school even gives free breakfast and lunch to all the kids because a lot of families struggle.  \n\nThe town's been trying to spruce itself up, but most of the work seems to be focused downtown, where the shops and traffic are. Our side gets a little forgotten, which can be frustrating.\n\nStill, we love it here. It’s our home. People are good, the school's great, we've got everything we need, and our house, well, it's comfortable. We've been here for 16 years, and we wouldn't trade it for the world.",
            "My neighborhood is a vibrant mix of history and character. It's nestled on a hill, surrounded by buildings that whisper tales of the past. I live in a seven-story apartment building right across from an old theater, and just down the street, there's this awesome arcade bar that draws in all sorts of folks on warm summer evenings. On weekends, especially in June and July, you'll often see a line snaking out the door. A few blocks up is the local park, surprisingly spacious for this part of town. It's enclosed by concrete with these steep stairs built right into the wall. During the harsh winter months, you'll see homeless people setting up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and on those wide steps. Though it doesn't snow much, the heavy downpours in mid-winter can make staying warm a real struggle. By clustering their tents together, they find warmth and are close to the only family center for miles, where they can find a hot shower and a chance to freshen up. What I truly love about my city, though, isn't the beauty of its historical landmarks – the towering buildings, the architecture that climbs the hills rolling down to the ocean.  It's the spirit of the people.  Hilltop used to be notorious for gang violence on the West Coast, and even today, stories from those days, when federal agents and the DEA would swoop in, echo through the neighborhood. The people here remember. These stories are passed down through generations, even to newcomers like me. Despite still being considered a rough area, the residents work hard to keep it clean and safe. They care deeply about their community. There are warnings about not walking around alone at night if you're white, but I think those are echoes of the past, a remnant of old prejudices. Maybe it's because I'm dark enough to pass as something other than a \"white girl,\" or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of their own, someone who understands the constant reminders of racism and social conditioning that plague our nation. Even in a city that prides itself on being a melting pot of cultures. One thing is for sure: no matter where I go, Hilltop will always be home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, encountering people who offer me a jacket more readily than a threat. It's a place where laundromat owners stay open late so I can charge my phone when caught in a downpour. It's a place where I've sat, feeling invisible, huddled against store fronts on the bleakest nights, only to have someone stop, look me in the eye, hand me five dollars, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I call home a slice of Rural America, tucked away in a small town in Michigan. You'll find no towering skyscrapers or sprawling shopping centers here – no Walmart, Target, not even an Applebee's in sight. You've gotta hit the road to get anything you need. Despite the lack of big-city amenities, I wouldn't trade this place for the world. It's surrounded by breathtaking water: Lake Michigan on one side, Lake Charlevoix on the other.  Beaches are practically everywhere you turn, perfect for dipping your toes and soaking up the sun.\n\nMy neighborhood is straight out of a quintessential small town picture book. Homes aren't crammed together, each one unique, some sporting a modern makeover, others proudly showcasing their age.  Most have full basements, visible from the street, and a kaleidoscope of colors adorns the aluminum siding of many. Yards are plentiful, bursting with life – trampolines bouncing, kids' playsets whirring, gardens flourishing, and fences keeping furry friends safe. It's a community of hard-working folks, raising families or cherishing the memories they've made.\n\nYou'll see kids zooming down sidewalks, dogs getting their daily walk, and neighbors cycling or rollerblading. There's a real sense of belonging here, a knowing glance exchanged between those who call this place home and those who are just passing through.  The air hums with the friendly chatter of neighbors grilling outside, a wave here, a smile there. Lawns are manicured with pride, free from fallen leaves and overgrown weeds.  \n\nIt's not about flashy homes, but about creating a sense of community, a place where families thrive. The quiet streets, the friendly faces, the feeling of safety – these are the things that make this neighborhood special. It's a place where you can let your guard down, knowing that you're among friends. \n\nThe county sheriff's department and jail are within walking distance, a reassuring presence in the community.  The health department is right next door, and the city recycling center is just down the road, a testament to the town's commitment to sustainability. \n\nBaseball and softball games echo through the air, the announcer's voice painting vivid pictures of the players' triumphs.  The small town airport, a stone's throw away, adds a little bit of excitement to the day with the rumble of small planes taking off and landing.  A local ice cream parlor is within easy reach, and a short bike ride takes you to the park, where kids can run free.\n\nIt might not be a glamorous place, but it's home. It's a place where life moves at a slower pace, where neighbors become friends, and where you can truly feel a sense of belonging."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "My neighborhood in this massive city is a real melting pot.  Residential areas pop up randomly between all these businesses - offices, shops, restaurants, you name it. There's always something new to try, whether it's a fancy restaurant or a quirky little boutique.  Big brands definitely have their place, but these independent shops are gaining popularity, popping up in malls and lining the streets, bringing a touch of excitement to what would otherwise be quiet neighborhoods.  And speaking of excitement, there are a couple of parks nearby that are always bustling with families.  \n\nThis diversity extends to the people too. We've got a big LGBTQ+ community, a thriving Orthodox Jewish community, and a bunch of folks who've moved here from the former Soviet Union, all in one small area.  Venture a bit further out, and you'll find even more cultures represented.  It's like a mini United Nations with \"Korea Town,\" \"China Town,\" \"Little Armenia,\" and so many more, all just a short (or long, depending on traffic) drive away.  Speaking of traffic, this city is notorious for it.  Even a 10-mile journey can easily take two hours during rush hour.  Walking isn't really an option, since the city is massive and people are glued to their cars.  Which, ironically, leads to the city being choked with cars and parking being a nightmare. \n\nAdding to the chaos, they're constantly building new apartment buildings, which is great for newcomers but makes existing residents groan at the thought of even more people and traffic.  But hey, not everyone wants to live in a giant apartment building.  My neighborhood has a mix of houses, from small bungalows to sprawling mansions, and everything in between.  You've got your single-family homes, duplexes, and smaller apartment complexes.  \n\nAnd the people?  A real mix of ages, but to be honest, I don't know most of them.  It's not as tight-knit as it used to be back when I was a kid and spent my days playing with my next-door neighbor and a few other neighborhood kids.",
            "My neighborhood is a bit of a time capsule, a snapshot of a bygone era. Most of the houses are single-family dwellings, some split into two while still attached, creating a unique kind of clustered intimacy. My place has a small front yard and a tiny driveway – a picture of suburban normalcy that once embodied the American dream.  \n\nThere's a bittersweet nostalgia hanging in the air. While the dream feels a bit distant now, the houses still whisper of a time when things were simpler, when the dream felt more attainable. People aren't as optimistic as they used to be, the yards aren't as manicured, but there are still cars in every driveway, and kids playing like the world revolves around their games. The old public school, standing strong after almost 90 years, seems to promise a future to the young while stirring memories in the older folks. \n\nThe churches are mostly empty, but the basketball courts are always buzzing. Every house has its own story, its own character, yet they all share a similar feeling – a sense of quiet community. The highlight is Super \"A,\" the local supermarket run by a Yemeni family, probably the only Arab family around.  \n\nMost folks are African American, and they've been here for generations, their roots intertwined with the neighborhood's history.  The streets are wide, and kids play football, stopping only for cars to pass. There are stories passed down from parent to child, tales of a time when everyone knew everyone. The karate school, once a hub of youthful aspirations, is now a pharmacy – reflecting a shift in priorities. \n\nEven the old movie theater, showing classic films at bargain prices, still draws crowds, mostly the older residents who appreciate a night out without the distractions of the latest releases. The expressway cuts through the town next door, a constant reminder of the outside world, a world that the town elders, with their yearning for a simpler time, have actively kept at bay. They ultimately blocked the petition for a local exit, fearing it would disrupt the town's tranquility.  A new high school is being built, and the town is debating a mascot. My vote? A cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin – the perfect embodiment of our town's unique blend of old and new.",
            "You might pass it over at first glance. It's tucked behind shops, not exactly a place that screams \"desirable living.\"  Not unless you're into the kind of hidden gems most people overlook.  But if you venture past the old, deserted Whole Foods and the hotels that only see action during family reunions, you'll stumble upon a vibrant community.  Imagine apartment complexes squeezed together like Russian nesting dolls, meticulously disassembled and lined up along the road.  The first ones you encounter are known for some shady dealings, so let's not dwell on those.  Appearances can be deceiving, after all. But the complexes next door, and the ones beyond those, are a world apart, a secret known only to a select few.  Across from them sits a community college branch, a sleepy collection of buildings where students shuffle in with coffee, yawning at 7 a.m. They trudge through the iron gates, which creak open one by one, while commuters bellow in frustration at the morning rush. The road intersects with another residential street, leading to a park on one side and a rehabilitation center on the other. The center's porch is decked out with cheerful furniture, and a lazy ceiling fan stirs the heavy summer air. \n\nKids zoom around the park, cartwheeling and giggling, while bees buzz lazily around the flower patches.  Seniors stroll their dogs, shaking their heads at the skateboarders and exchanging knowing glances with the teenage girls huddled by the playground, gossiping about boys and the latest viral videos.   A strip mall nearby houses a sushi joint serving cheap eats, a swimming supply store, and a nail salon – a one-stop shop for pool parties and manicures.  There's also a frozen yogurt place, the DIY kind, where teens often gather, clutching cold cups of sugary goodness while they try out their latest skateboarding tricks and puff on vapes, convinced it makes them cool.   This neighborhood is pure Americana, a snapshot of the sleepy south where time seems to stand still.",
            "\"Where's everything?\" she asked as we drove past endless cornfields. I knew she'd be shocked by how empty it all seemed. She was from a town where you could walk to the grocery store in five minutes, she'd never seen this much open space before. Overwhelmed by the sea of corn, I told her about growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood who I was and where I came from.  We turned onto a two-lane country road, passing a quarry filled with water. Just past it was the small development where I live. Most of the houses are made of brick and stucco, each one with at least half an acre of land that everyone takes pride in keeping up. In the spring, flowers bloom everywhere, alongside the midwestern trees that change colors with each season. The driveways are always filled with fancy Mercedes-Benz cars, gleaming in the afternoon sun after a good wash.  \n\nAs we continued down the road towards my grey stucco house, my Korean neighbor was out in his yard, as always, with a friendly smile. He spends all day mowing his lawn, singing along to the hum of his mower. Everyone in the neighborhood finds it amusing, but he's a genuinely kind guy with a fascinating past. He's gotten older and his wit isn't what it used to be. Back in the day, he was a doctor, but now he mostly blends in with the grass and his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Finally, we reached my house. \n\nGeese wander the side yard, chased by our terrier. Out back, a small stream flows into the quarry. You can hear bullfrogs, the gentle gurgling of the stream, and the occasional \"moo\" from the nearby farms.  Across a handmade wooden bridge is a peaceful haven filled with trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was where I spent most of my childhood. Whether building tree forts or \"hunting\" (which mostly involved chasing critters), there was always something to do, and there was always a neighborhood friend around. \n\nThe winters in our small town can be really harsh, but they're also beautiful. The yard transforms from a lush green into a bare wilderness. The trees that once boasted vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers become just skeletons of bark. When it snows, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is covered with snow angels made by my little sister and snowmen.  My sister and I fought constantly as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapons of choice. We'd build massive igloo-like forts to store our \"arsenal\" of branches.  In our own little winter wonderland, we played pretend, lost in a world where nothing else mattered. We were just carefree kids.",
            "Portland, Oregon, has this thing about \"weird,\"  a vibe that's more than just a slogan painted on a building that somehow manages to be a pizza place, bar, music venue, and, well, let's just say it pushes the boundaries of legality. It's a place where the phrase \"Keep Portland Weird\" is like a rallying cry. \n\nSome see it as a nostalgic nod to the days when Portland was a hidden gem, less fancy and more affordable, where quirky subcultures thrived.  Others see it as an invitation: come to Portland, where being different isn't just accepted, it's celebrated.  \n\nEven with the influx of folks from California and all the new condos popping up, Portland still holds onto its weirdness.  It's not about blindly accepting everything, but it's about embracing the unconventional. We've got our share of modern conveniences and dramas, just like everywhere else. We buy our stuff from China, have yoga studios, and yes, even hipsters. Maybe \"weird\" just means we take things a little less seriously.\n\nTake my neighborhood, for example. It's full of colorful houses, front yards bursting with flowers, herbs, and veggies, and these magical things called \"free boxes\" that show up in the summer. These aren't your average cardboard boxes; they're treasure troves, filled with everything from clothes and books to who-knows-what. You never know what you'll find, but it's always a surprise.\n\nThat sense of wonder, that magic of discovery, that's what Portland is all about, at least to me. But there are a million ways to be weird in Portland, a million different flavors of \"unique.\" You've got people going to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real goats!), cheering on the Timbers soccer team, or simply embracing the weirdness in their own way.\n\nPortland is a city full of dreamers, people chasing their passions, or at least daydreaming about it over a pint at the local pub.  We've got our problems, sure. Drug addiction is a real issue, stemming from deeper mental health struggles, and the endless rain doesn't exactly help. Homelessness is another challenge, with a complex web of causes and no easy solutions.  The non-homeless population grapples with feelings of compassion and frustration, just like everywhere else.  But even with those struggles, Portland remains true to its heart, a place where being different is not just tolerated, it's celebrated.",
            "The mountains are always there, like silent guardians in the north, watching the sun rise and set every day.  No matter how busy I get, how lost in work or life, they're still there, strong and steady, unfazed by everything else. On days when stress is at its peak, they seem to call out to me, and when I turn to them, they offer a sense of peace and strength to carry on.\n\nI first fell for this place when I started college. The mountains north of campus were what truly captivated me. Sure, the university itself has its own beauty – the buildings, the ponds, the trees – all hold a special place in my heart. But the mountains reign supreme.\n\nThe town itself is charming in its own right. There are countless cafés where I spent countless hours fueled by caffeine and study sessions. A short walk or bus ride takes you to the downtown area, where the old, faded brick buildings create an atmosphere of history and vibrancy, almost as bustling as the nearby city.  But it's a short journey back to the quiet small-town feel, just past the library. This blend of urban energy and peaceful suburbs gives the town a unique charm, inviting exploration and making it easy to create lasting memories.\n\nThere are good memories, like walking past the rusty swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter, or sprinting through the busy downtown to catch a movie at the fancy theater thanks to a student discount. But there are also tough memories, because every place holds those too. The ponds, in particular, have been both a place of reflection and a spot for late-night existential crises. I've spent many a night there, watching turtles, ducks, and insects go about their lives, contemplating my own purpose in the face of life's mysteries.\n\nOne day, I was walking past the pond, the park, and the typical suburban houses, until I reached the main street. The sun was shining brightly on the palm trees, painting the sky in hues of blue and yellow. As I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was heading north. There they were, as they always had been – the majestic mountains, towering over everything else, silently reminding me to keep going.",
            "Alright, so you're thinking of checking out Bensonhurst, Brooklyn? Finding it won't be a problem, trust me. Public transport's pretty much the go-to in NYC, and Bensonhurst's a classic city neighborhood. You'll definitely feel that New York vibe.  \n\nGet ready for a serious dose of Asian shops everywhere you look. The neighborhood's been welcoming a ton of Asian folks over the last couple of decades, so you'll practically stumble into an Asian-owned store every block. Supermarkets and laundromats are like the kings of this neighborhood, and honestly, they're a hit with locals too. The food in the supermarkets is amazing, prices are super reasonable, and let's be real, convenience is key. I'm talking four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute stroll from where I am! Grocery shopping?  A breeze.\n\nNow, don't get me wrong, Bensonhurst isn't just an Asian enclave. It's a melting pot, with immigrants, first-gen and second-gen Americans all hanging out.  Most of the big businesses are Asian-owned, but there's also a recently revamped park nearby with a ton to offer: basketball courts, soccer and baseball fields, handball courts, swings, a playground, even a water fountain for the little ones. You'll see all walks of life mixing it up in the park, just like the rest of NYC.\n\nCorporate giants aren't really Bensonhurst's thing. Mostly, you'll find co-op buildings and condos, but two-family houses are the real MVPs here. The people are generally friendly, though they can be a bit loud.  Think cars blasting music, revving engines that'll wake you up at the crack of dawn.  \n\nIf you're visiting at night, stay aware of your surroundings.  Bensonhurst is safe enough, but you know how it is in any big city – people can be unpredictable.  You might encounter some troublemakers, bullies, or even petty thieves. I've had some run-ins with bullies in the past (physical assault, back when I was younger), and recently, there have been some package thefts. \n\nAnd one last thing – dog owners, please clean up after your pets!  Despite the fines in NYC, seemingly nobody here follows the rules. You'll be dodging dog waste left and right on your way to the train station or the supermarket. It's my biggest pet peeve!  Watch your step, and keep those shoes clean!",
            "My neighborhood is perched on a steep hill, the highest point everyone calls \"workout hill\" due to the runners who tackle it daily.  Sidewalks are a rare commodity here, so everyone walks right on the road, a bumpy path pockmarked with divots and patched wires. Rain and storms are frequent visitors, battering the power lines with branches and debris.  The constant repairs leave them looking like a haphazard patchwork.  Towering evergreen trees blanket the landscape, but locals seem to despise them, striving to cut them down for an unobstructed ocean view. This explains the abundance of houses perched high on the hill, boasting large glass-fronted second stories that frame the bay. Sunsets are breathtaking, with the water glowing from below and the sky ablaze with orange hues. However, the frequent overcast days mean most sunlight filters through a hazy veil, leaving most days damp and shrouded in mist.  Everything succumbs to moss: roofs, cars, railings, even my car sat in the driveway for a month and sprouted a thick green fuzz.\n\nDespite a school nearby, kids are scarce. The neighborhood is dominated by retirees, with dogs replacing children. They roam freely, often seen lounging in lawns or chasing each other down the street. Doors and windows better be kept shut, or you might find a furry intruder snooping inside. I once had one waltz into my living room – not the best houseguest! Add to that the mischievous rabbits who dig up gardens and burrow into lawns, a source of amusement for my cats who have hunted most of them out.  We also have our share of birds: sparrows, hummingbirds, occasional hawks or eagles chased off by the neighborhood crows.  \n\nThere are no shops around, but a short hike downhill leads to waterfront restaurants serving up fresh seafood. The beach is limited, but the rocks along the shore offer endless fun for tossing into the water. The bay itself is narrow, with the opposite shore visible even through the mist on most days.",
            "Alright, so I live in this typical suburban place in a small town down South.  Picture it: a street connecting two major highways, which means more traffic than I'd prefer, but hey, at least it's not boring. It's a pretty quiet neighborhood though. People kinda stick around, so I know most of the folks here. Everyone's busy with their lawn care and regular stuff, you know, the usual. In the winter, we crank up the sledding down the hill on our street. We're on the corner, so we see everyone coming and going.  We even keep track of the different cars that drive by.  If a strange vehicle rolls through, we definitely notice it.  Some neighbors like to walk for exercise or walk their dogs. Kids are out on their bikes, just your standard neighborhood scene. We work from home, so we're around a lot. It's the four of us: my wife, me, and our two daughters, who are eleven and fourteen.  Guess everyone else is used to seeing us around too.  We get outside and play, even in the rain sometimes.  We fire up the grill on the back deck every once in a while, and the smell of barbecue just fills the air. It seems like someone's always mowing the lawn around here. You can hear that lawnmower droning pretty much every day from spring to fall, when the grass finally chills out. We've got a ton of trees around us, because the area used to be all woods, so there's plenty of shade.  But that means a whole lot of leaves in the fall, which means raking and burning. I actually kind of love the smell of burning leaves, so that's a good sign that fall is here.  We haven't really had much of a winter lately, so it feels like fall just keeps going and going. Our garage is in the back, so we practically never use the front door unless someone knocks, which isn't often. I like to tinker with my truck or other projects in the garage, and when the garage doors are open, it's like I'm more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays are pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving brings some out-of-town relatives, so there are extra cars everywhere for a bit. It's the same for Mother's Day and Christmas. Overall, I dig it here. If it weren't for the through-street traffic, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is smack-dab in the middle of the high desert – think dirt, dirt, and more dirt. Unless you've actually lived here, you probably can't grasp the feeling of constantly seeing brown. And when you do see a lawn, you know that person is shelling out a small fortune to keep it that way. Back in the 90s when I first moved here, houses were spread out like stars in the night sky. Now, it's still pretty spread out, but there are tons of new additions popping up everywhere. Honestly, it's getting more and more city-like every day, but I guess that's happening everywhere these days.  \n\nMost of the people here are super friendly, just like in any city, there are good parts and bad parts. I'm surrounded by friendly old folks in my neighborhood, so I guess it's a pretty decent place to live.  \n\nWhen it comes to shopping, it's mostly chains like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you're looking for anything upscale, you've gotta hit the road. I don't see any Whole Foods or anything like that around here.\n\nBased on what I see, the most common jobs in town are in construction. I think it's because this city is still developing – there's a ton of open space left to build on.  That kinda freaks me out, though. I like things the way they are now. I left a big city, and I'm not itching to go back.\n\nSpeaking of construction, that's where my full-time gig is – I'm a drywall and T-bar installer. \n\nWhat I love about living here is the wildlife. People come here for all sorts of reasons, but the stark beauty of the desert is a big draw. The climate and landscape have created these challenging ecosystems that need protection. They're home to all sorts of cool creatures. It's important for us humans to learn about our wild neighbors so we can coexist peacefully. My family and I have adjusted really well to the wildlife. My three kids are obsessed with lizards and desert bugs. Right now, they're out there trying to catch some specimens. \n\nAs for tourist attractions, we've got a few. Victorville is a great place for families to experience the desert. It's a different kind of experience, for sure. If you're planning a visit, try to time it with the San Bernardino County Fair. It's a blast. Also, check out Wrightwood nearby – you can see the snow-covered mountains and even take some winter sports lessons.\n\nIf you're interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert, the Victor Valley Museum is worth a visit. They've got geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of Victorville's development.",
            "Okay, so when people ask about my neighborhood, it's a bit different than theirs, I reckon. Most folks probably picture a bunch of houses and families, right? Well, my \"hood\" is the college campus I live on. My dorm mates are my crew, and the whole campus is my stomping ground.  \n\nSure, it's not your typical neighborhood, but it's got the usual stuff: places to live, people, shops, and even a park. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, the digs. We've got apartments, regular houses rented out to alumni, and, of course, the dorms where most of us undergrads hang. Apartments usually have a few folks per room, maybe 20 or so in a building. Houses are rarer, mostly for alumni, and then there's the dorms, packed with hundreds of students, two to a room. \n\nThen there's the people. My school's all about diversity, so my neighborhood's a melting pot. You've got folks from all walks of life, all ages, all backgrounds.  The staff lives in the houses, newer students are in the dorms, and the older ones usually snag apartments. \n\nThere's too much to say about the people, so let's skip to the good stuff: the shops and the park! My campus is pretty self-contained, so we've got our own food joints, clothes stores, even a grocery store.  And the park? It's everyone's hangout, always clean and safe, thanks to all of us looking out for each other.",
            "Okay, so I've been living here for about 10 years now, so I think I have a pretty good handle on the place. When I first moved here from Riverdale to Stockbridge, I gotta admit, I was bummed out. I missed my old neighborhood and everyone in it, but my folks wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we made the switch for better housing, a better school, the whole \"not ghetto\" deal. \n\nOver the years, I got used to it. I made some new friends, some not-so-friendly faces too, but hey, that's life, right?  I never really clicked with most of the neighbors, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis for a while, since they lived right next door. They're cool people, almost like family, and I'm genuinely grateful to have them. \n\nI remember when my family went to Mr. Glen's wedding – they got remarried!  It was a blast, a total party, and something I'm looking forward to someday when I'm all settled down with a wife of my own. I even caught the little white strap off his wife, Ms. Veda's leg when she tossed it! Sadly, I missed the bouquet. We danced the night away, and I had a great time hanging with Marsharii, one of their daughters. Haven't seen her since, but I hope she's doing well.\n\nThis neighborhood is like a maze, honestly, but now that I have GPS, I'm thinking about exploring it more.  So far, my explorations have mostly been with my buddies Kason and Curtis, back when we were into video games and just living it up. Sometimes I'd chill out at the park, enjoying the peace and quiet. It really calms me down, gives me a sense of serenity. I'll even bring some sticks from Home Depot and practice my balance, sometimes even my bokken wooden sword.  \n\nThere's a basketball and tennis court too, although I haven't played in ages. Still, it's nice to have them there just in case I get the urge to pick up a racket or a ball again. My dad got me and my best friend into tennis with Mr. Graves back in the day. We had a blast, and they pushed us hard, but it was always fun. \n\nLooking back, I've had a lot of good times in this neighborhood. There are tons of stories, but these are the ones that really stick with me.  I have a feeling the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is pretty sweet because it's right by my college. It's mostly apartments, but there are some decent, affordable bars and restaurants around. One bar just got a fancy makeover and jacked up its prices, but it's not *that* bad. Most people here are either students or just scraping by since the apartments aren't exactly luxurious. There are tons of kids around because of the elementary school a stone's throw away. I don't really know my neighbors, and honestly, I'm good with that. They're pretty heavy into the weed, so the building management put this ridiculous air freshener thing right outside their door. It's hilarious, almost insulting. \n\nThe buildings around here are mostly old-school, but some have been renovated inside. There are some brand-new apartments down the street, but I can't stand them. They're cheaply built and super expensive, a total scam because they're near campus. They get away with it because, well, they're near campus. There's this cheap-ass restaurant a few minutes away that serves everything on paper plates and microwaves most of the food. Across the street is a gas station that supposedly has terrible working conditions. But hey, at least the road was redone last summer with city money. Now there's a nice sidewalk, some greenery, and it actually looks decent. \n\nMy building is surrounded by trees, though they chopped down a few. There's a whole tree line behind the complex, and then another set of apartments. I'm on 42nd street, but behind me is 43rd, which is rougher. The sidewalks are falling apart, the buildings look dingy, and the whole vibe is off. They've got lots of trees there too, probably to hide the buildings. A lot of the crime in the area seems to be concentrated in one apartment complex on 43rd, though I wouldn't blame them entirely. The apartments across the street from me have a pretty high turnover rate and their share of problems too. \n\nBut overall, I'm pretty happy with where I live. It's affordable, convenient, and I'm within walking distance of the university. Plus, there are two bus stops nearby, so getting to the store or downtown is easy peasy.",
            "My neighborhood is a collection of duplexes arranged on a cul-de-sac, spaced out to look like individual houses. They all share the same yellow paint, white porches, and green metal roofs, giving them a uniform look.  Most of the residents know each other well and often gather at the ends of driveways in the evenings. While the kids play, the adults chat and enjoy the simple pleasures of community life. It's a refreshing escape from the constant buzz of technology and feels like stepping back in time.  \n\nWe're surrounded by fields, trees, and endless blue skies, but lately, we've been dealing with some stormy weather. This season has brought tornado warnings, and last night, we even heard the sirens. I found myself huddled in my bathtub with my smallest dog, my purse, and a few pillows, while my other dog nervously paced the living room.  The storm unleashed a barrage of hail, and afterward, the ground steamed from the sudden temperature drop. It went from a scorching 92 degrees to a cool 75 in just minutes. The hail melted instantly upon hitting the hot pavement. \n\nAfter the storm passed, a double rainbow appeared in the clearing sky. I rushed to grab my camera and snapped some pictures to share with my loved ones. It was a breathtaking sight, and the neighborhood remained quiet for another hour before people started trickling back home. Life returned to normal, with parents and kids outside enjoying the evening air as dinner cooked.  \n\nMy new neighborhood in North Carolina is a wonderful place to live. Even though we all have similar two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartments, the interiors vary, with some being surprisingly small.  I love taking walks in the large field behind my apartment and heading down to the pond, where I've seen deer and hear the booming call of a giant bullfrog each morning. It's a peaceful retreat just forty minutes outside of Charlotte.  \n\nEvery morning is greeted by the sound of roosters crowing from nearby farms, making it feel like living in a small, close-knit village. Even the local donkey braying in the evening adds to the charm.  I feel incredibly lucky to have found this hidden gem of a neighborhood.",
            "Moving into this neighborhood right before eighth grade was a bit rough at first. Making friends took some time, but I eventually became close with a couple of guys – one lives two houses down and the other on my street. They've since moved, but those memories stick with me.  Most of the folks who were here when I first moved are still around. It's a pretty typical American suburb, full of two-story houses. Weekends, or any time the weather's nice, you can hear kids playing outside. It's pretty quiet most days, though. I've never had any issues with anyone here. You're pretty much left to your own devices unless you need something, which is cool. I've ordered tons of stuff online and never had a package disappear from my porch. I trust my neighbors.\n\nThere's a park just a couple minutes from my house, loaded with memories. Played basketball, football, baseball there with the neighborhood crew. Even got a nasty elbow to the nose playing football, but the good times definitely outweigh the bad. Now, when I go, it's mostly to hang with my cousin's kids. They're way younger than me and still into swings and slides and that kinda stuff. Just thinking about the park gets them pumped! It's pretty nostalgic for me now, for a bunch of reasons.\n\nThe neighborhood's pretty diverse, with all kinds of food options nearby. Within a mile, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian – the works. Though, these days, a lot of people just use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for delivery. The usual suspects are the fast food chains, which you can find anywhere in the suburbs, and there are tons of pizza places too.  The stores here have everything you could need. Plenty of dry cleaners, a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street, even a Jewel-Osco grocery store, a Midwest staple. There's even an Indian-owned store if you're in the mood for homemade or ready-made Indian food.\n\nOverall, I dig my neighborhood. Reading about other people's nightmare neighbors on social media and the news makes me appreciate mine even more.",
            "My town, Johnston, isn't exactly a standout in South Carolina. It's just your average, run-of-the-mill town, but it's got this big claim to fame: it's the \"Peach Capital of the World.\" You'll see it plastered on the welcome sign, and it's pretty much true.  The whole place is basically one giant peach orchard or cattle ranch.  \n\nThe houses are spread out, mostly two-story affairs with either metal roofs or gray shingles, probably to deal with the scorching summer heat. They're usually tucked back from the road, giving way to fields for animals or crops. The heart of town is pretty small, with just one stoplight at a four-way intersection. That's where you'll find the only stores in town. \n\nYou've got your usual fast food options: Hong Kong, a tiny Chinese spot run by a family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a local burger chain. Sadly, the pizza place closed down recently. There's a little family pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, known more for their Cherry Coca-Cola than anything else. And then there's IGA, the only grocery store but it's kind of pricey, so most people head to Walmart in the next town over for groceries. The real star of the show is Dollar General – it's always packed with folks grabbing everyday essentials.\n\nThere's also Possibilities Furniture & More, a charming little store run by a local legend. They even have movers who'll deliver your furniture! Attached to the furniture store is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet groomer that does it all: daycare, boarding, grooming, the works. \n\nThe doctor's office and the vet are both tucked away from the main drag, but they're well-equipped to take care of the town's needs. There's just one elementary school, Johnston Elementary. After fifth grade, kids have to head to the next town for middle and high school. \n\nParks? Well, they're working on a 2.5-acre park, but for now, there aren't really any. No movie theaters, bowling alleys, or places to hang out. It's pretty quiet here. But hey, it's a nice place to live, small enough to be overlooked.",
            "My first encounter with my current neighborhood came through a podcast about missing people, which was a bit of a shock. I mean, rents here are sky-high, often exceeding a thousand dollars a month.  It was surprising to learn about this story, as neither I nor any of my friends had ever heard of it. Maybe it's the struggle of making ends meet that makes these things happen. I know some friends who have tough nights, crying themselves to sleep because of the cost of living. Things are expensive, but we've become masters of frugality over the years. We've learned to appreciate the charm of dusty flea market treasures and moth-eaten clothes. As we age, we tend to smell less, perhaps because we're more used to the way things are. But the flea market always holds its own. The smell of adulthood for me is a mix of dusty magazines piled on a closed piano, lingering in the leather even after washing it. \n\nSpeaking of flea markets, there are three thrift stores within walking distance here. Starting from one end, you can visit two charity shops, a library, a rare book store, and a quirky curio shop. Downtown is bustling with cars and people every morning, but the thrift stores are peaceful sanctuaries. No matter how many people or vehicles pass by, there's a hush inside. It's a perfect place to lose yourself for an afternoon. Every year, the city seems to get denser, with more cars and people. They call it a developing city, a place where one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery is headquartered. It's still growing, showing signs of those growing pains. It reminds me of New York City – everyone's focused on their own goals, and there's not much expectation of anything from anyone else. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will respect your space. It's not like the South, where showing a little concern is seen as genuine care. People here don't pry into your life. You can keep your guard up as long as you like, and the city rolls on, like waves on a beach. It's a lively place to be. \n\nBetween the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something happening. In a way, we're less like strangers in an apartment building and more like a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and support each other when we can. I feel fortunate to be here. I like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I make an effort to keep my space clean and leave them food, and they do the same for me. I bring them their mail, and they bring me mine. It's nice to see them, and I believe they enjoy my company as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, impersonal modernist sprawl, but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I haven't completely messed up my life.",
            "So, where I live is like, your basic, everyday suburb, y'know?  There's a homeowner's association here that's *really* into keeping things looking neat and tidy.  Driving around, you'll see rows and rows of identical houses, all perfectly manicured lawns, a sprinkle of decorative rocks, and tiny driveways.  Every once in a while, there's a small tree trying to break up the monotony, and two-car garages are the norm. The roads are always freshly paved, which is nice, but kinda boring.  I mean, you won't find any potholes or anything, but it's all just...predictable. Most of the houses are one story, but a few have two. And the mail situation?  Forget those individual mailboxes you see everywhere else – we've got a huge communal box at the end of the street, like an apartment building.  Key required, of course.  Gotta keep things uniform, right?\n\nMy place is kind of on the edge of the city, so it's kinda like a mix of rural and suburban.  We've got tons of space, which is cool. There are a bunch of community pools – gated and well-maintained – and walking trails everywhere.  You don't even need to go to a park to get your steps in.  The neighborhood's mostly made up of retired folks, so it's super safe and everyone knows each other.  There are a few younger folks and middle-aged professionals mixed in, but not many.  \n\nThe city itself is pretty big, population-wise, but it still feels like a small town.  We've got all the basic stuff you need, like a mall – not huge, but it does the trick. It takes about 15 minutes to get anywhere decent though.  We've got everything from fancy organic grocery stores to bargain outlets with half the staff and twice the dusty shelves. Overall, it's a pretty standard, safe, and well-kept neighborhood.",
            "My town's kinda like that quiet cousin of a bigger city. It's got a small-town feel, but you're close enough to the city stuff if you need it. My part of town, on the east side, isn't the fanciest.  Houses are older, mostly rentals, and you know, sometimes things go missing from porches if you're not careful.  But it's not a bad place. Folks are friendly, wave when you walk by, and crime, while it happens, isn't anything crazy. There have been some rough incidents, shootings a few blocks over, even a homicide. We lost a neighbor’s son to a shooting last year, which was tough. But overall, we're lucky - nothing major has ever directly hit home.\n\nThe whole opioid thing has been a big weight on our town, like everywhere else.  We've lost people, but there are a lot of good resources trying to fight it - rehab centers, Narcan training, that kind of thing.\n\nBut hey, there are good things here too. My son’s school is amazing, from the teachers to the staff. He’s got special needs, but they make him feel right at home. The school even gives free breakfast and lunch to all the kids because a lot of families struggle.  \n\nThe town's been trying to spruce itself up, but most of the work seems to be focused downtown, where the shops and traffic are. Our side gets a little forgotten, which can be frustrating.\n\nStill, we love it here. It’s our home. People are good, the school's great, we've got everything we need, and our house, well, it's comfortable. We've been here for 16 years, and we wouldn't trade it for the world.",
            "My neighborhood is a vibrant mix of history and character. It's nestled on a hill, surrounded by buildings that whisper tales of the past. I live in a seven-story apartment building right across from an old theater, and just down the street, there's this awesome arcade bar that draws in all sorts of folks on warm summer evenings. On weekends, especially in June and July, you'll often see a line snaking out the door. A few blocks up is the local park, surprisingly spacious for this part of town. It's enclosed by concrete with these steep stairs built right into the wall. During the harsh winter months, you'll see homeless people setting up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and on those wide steps. Though it doesn't snow much, the heavy downpours in mid-winter can make staying warm a real struggle. By clustering their tents together, they find warmth and are close to the only family center for miles, where they can find a hot shower and a chance to freshen up. What I truly love about my city, though, isn't the beauty of its historical landmarks – the towering buildings, the architecture that climbs the hills rolling down to the ocean.  It's the spirit of the people.  Hilltop used to be notorious for gang violence on the West Coast, and even today, stories from those days, when federal agents and the DEA would swoop in, echo through the neighborhood. The people here remember. These stories are passed down through generations, even to newcomers like me. Despite still being considered a rough area, the residents work hard to keep it clean and safe. They care deeply about their community. There are warnings about not walking around alone at night if you're white, but I think those are echoes of the past, a remnant of old prejudices. Maybe it's because I'm dark enough to pass as something other than a \"white girl,\" or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of their own, someone who understands the constant reminders of racism and social conditioning that plague our nation. Even in a city that prides itself on being a melting pot of cultures. One thing is for sure: no matter where I go, Hilltop will always be home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, encountering people who offer me a jacket more readily than a threat. It's a place where laundromat owners stay open late so I can charge my phone when caught in a downpour. It's a place where I've sat, feeling invisible, huddled against store fronts on the bleakest nights, only to have someone stop, look me in the eye, hand me five dollars, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I call home a slice of Rural America, tucked away in a small town in Michigan. You'll find no towering skyscrapers or sprawling shopping centers here – no Walmart, Target, not even an Applebee's in sight. You've gotta hit the road to get anything you need. Despite the lack of big-city amenities, I wouldn't trade this place for the world. It's surrounded by breathtaking water: Lake Michigan on one side, Lake Charlevoix on the other.  Beaches are practically everywhere you turn, perfect for dipping your toes and soaking up the sun.\n\nMy neighborhood is straight out of a quintessential small town picture book. Homes aren't crammed together, each one unique, some sporting a modern makeover, others proudly showcasing their age.  Most have full basements, visible from the street, and a kaleidoscope of colors adorns the aluminum siding of many. Yards are plentiful, bursting with life – trampolines bouncing, kids' playsets whirring, gardens flourishing, and fences keeping furry friends safe. It's a community of hard-working folks, raising families or cherishing the memories they've made.\n\nYou'll see kids zooming down sidewalks, dogs getting their daily walk, and neighbors cycling or rollerblading. There's a real sense of belonging here, a knowing glance exchanged between those who call this place home and those who are just passing through.  The air hums with the friendly chatter of neighbors grilling outside, a wave here, a smile there. Lawns are manicured with pride, free from fallen leaves and overgrown weeds.  \n\nIt's not about flashy homes, but about creating a sense of community, a place where families thrive. The quiet streets, the friendly faces, the feeling of safety – these are the things that make this neighborhood special. It's a place where you can let your guard down, knowing that you're among friends. \n\nThe county sheriff's department and jail are within walking distance, a reassuring presence in the community.  The health department is right next door, and the city recycling center is just down the road, a testament to the town's commitment to sustainability. \n\nBaseball and softball games echo through the air, the announcer's voice painting vivid pictures of the players' triumphs.  The small town airport, a stone's throw away, adds a little bit of excitement to the day with the rumble of small planes taking off and landing.  A local ice cream parlor is within easy reach, and a short bike ride takes you to the park, where kids can run free.\n\nIt might not be a glamorous place, but it's home. It's a place where life moves at a slower pace, where neighbors become friends, and where you can truly feel a sense of belonging."

Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

You've got your typical office buildings, but also all kinds of stores, restaurants, and entertainment spots.  There's always something new to try, whether it's a fancy chain store or a cool little boutique popping up on every corner. These boutiques aren't just found in malls, they've taken over the streets, adding some buzz to quieter neighborhoods.  \n\nAnd speaking of buzz, there are a couple of parks nearby that are always packed with families. As for the people, my neighborhood is a crazy mix. We've got a strong LGBTQ+ presence, a big Orthodox Jewish community, and a bunch of immigrants from the former Soviet Union all living together.\n\nVenture a little further out, and you'll find even more diverse pockets, like Korea Town, China Town, Little Armenia, and so on.  They're all just a short drive away, but \"short\" can be a relative term in this city. Ten miles can easily turn into a two-hour nightmare thanks to rush hour traffic. \n\nIt's a car-centric place, so most people don't walk around much. Since everything is spread out, even places that seem close can be a pain to get to on foot.  This leads to some of the worst traffic in the world and a never-ending search for parking. Ironically, they're building tons of new apartments, which is great for attracting more people, but not so great for those of us who are already here and struggling with the traffic and parking.\n\nBut hey, at least there's variety in housing. You've got your massive apartment buildings, but also tons of houses, duplexes, smaller apartment complexes, and everything in between.  It's a mixed bag in terms of people too.  I don't really know most of my neighbors, it's not exactly a close-knit community anymore. Back in the day, though, we used to play outside all the time with the kids from the neighborhood. Those were the days.",
            "My neighborhood is a fascinating blend of old and new. Most of the homes are traditional single-family houses, though a few have been divided into two separate units while still sharing a wall. My own place has a small front yard and a tiny driveway. It's the kind of house that whispers of a bygone era when suburban living was the quintessential American dream.  A dream that once felt inclusive, but now seems to be slipping away. Yet, my neighborhood, along with countless others like it, still holds out hope, still calls to us, reminding us that the dream endures. \n\nWhile the optimism might not be as bright as it once was, and the yards aren't always perfectly manicured, there are still cars in every driveway, and kids playing as if they own the world. The old public school, a landmark for nearly 90 years, stands tall, offering a glimpse of the future to today's youth while stirring up memories for the older generation. \n\nChurches are scarce, mostly empty now, but the basketball courts are always buzzing with activity. Every house looks different, yet they share a common feeling, a sense of shared history. There's a large supermarket, \"Super A,\" run by a large Yemeni family, likely the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The majority of residents are African American, with families who have lived here for generations, their stories weaving a tapestry of a time when everyone knew everyone else. \n\nThere used to be a karate school, but when Hollywood moved on from \"The Karate Kid,\" the kids lost interest, and it's now a pharmacy – because, as they say, drugs solve everything. There's also a small movie theater showing classic films at discounted prices. It's a haven for the older generation, who appreciate a night out without the distractions of today's blockbusters, while the youth look down upon its lack of new releases.\n\nA single expressway cuts through our town, technically entering and exiting in the neighboring town. We once tried to get our own exit, but the youth supported it, while the elders opposed it, arguing that it would ruin our town's charm. They eventually convinced the city council to deny our request. Now, a new high school is being built, and we're debating a mascot.

            "You might overlook it at first glance. It's tucked behind a shopping strip in a residential area, not exactly a place you'd expect to find vibrant living spaces. Not the kind of place most people would choose to live. But if you venture past the old, deserted Whole Foods and behind the hotels that mostly stand empty except for occasional family reunions in the summer, you'll stumble upon a thriving community.  \n\nDown these hidden streets, nestled together like disassembled Russian nesting dolls, are a few apartment complexes. The first ones you encounter have a somewhat shady reputation, so let's not dwell on them. Appearances can be deceiving, right? But the complexes next to those, and the ones after that, are worlds apart, unknown to most people in the area.  \n\nAcross from these apartments sits a quiet satellite campus of a community college. Sleepy students shuffle in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to start their day. The iron gates creak open to let them in one by one, while commuters give them the stink eye and grumble about the traffic delays on busier mornings. The road then intersects with another residential street, where a park sits on one side and a rehabilitation center for people recovering from injuries stands on the other. The center boasts cheerful porch furniture and a lazy ceiling fan that stirs up the thick summer air. \n\nKids zoom around the park across the street, cartwheeling and playing tag. Bees buzz lazily around the flowerbeds by the road.

            "She asked, \"Where is everything?\" as we drove past endless cornfields stretching as far as the eye could see.  I knew she'd be stunned by the vast emptiness of the landscape. She grew up in a town where the grocery store was just a stone's throw away, so this much open space was completely foreign to her. Overwhelmed by the sea of corn, I told her about growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood where I came from. \n\nAs we continued down the two-lane road, you'd reach a quarry filled with water. Just past it lies the small development I call home. Mostly brick and stucco houses, each with at least half an acre of land, take pride of place.  Springtime explodes with color from the flowers planted each year, alongside the ever-changing hues of the Midwestern trees. Gleaming Mercedes Benzes, the epitome of luxury, fill the driveways, sparkling in the midday sun after a good wash.\n\nNear my grey stucco house, my Korean neighbor always greets me with a warm smile. He spends his days meticulously tending to his lawn, his laughter often accompanying the hum of his lawnmower. Everyone finds his dedication amusing, but he's a genuinely kind soul with a fascinating past.  He's a bit older now, his wit slightly dimmed by time. Once a doctor, he blends seamlessly with the grass and his John Deere Zero Turn mower.\n\nFinally, we reach my house. Geese roam the side yard, chased by our energetic Terrier. Out back, a small stream flows into the quarry, where bullfrogs croak, the water murmurs, and the occasional \"moo\" from nearby farms reaches our ears.  A handmade wooden bridge leads to a secluded oasis untouched by human hands.  Here, trees, herbs, and wildflowers grow wild and free. This was my childhood playground. From building tree forts to 'hunting' (mostly chasing) animals, there was always something to do, and a neighborhood friend was always around.\n\nWinters in our small town are harsh but breathtaking.  The green yard transforms into a desolate wilderness. Trees, once adorned with vibrant flowers, stand bare, skeletal against the sky. When snow falls, it blankets everything in a magical white layer. Snow angels and snowmen line the backyard, remnants of my sister and I's childhood battles. We fought constantly, and during winter, snowballs were our weapons of choice. We built massive, igloo-like forts to store our arsenal of branches, creating our own winter wonderland. In that world, pretending was everything, and we were just carefree kids.",
            "You gotta get Portland, Oregon. \"Keep Portland Weird,\" it says on a building that's basically a pizza place, bar, music venue, and, well, let's just say it pushes the boundaries a little. Some folks see it as a throwback to the '90s and early 2000s, a time before Portland got famous and pricey, when all sorts of unique subcultures thrived. For others, it's a call to adventure – come to Portland, where \"weird\" isn't a bad thing, it's a badge of honor. Even with all the fancy Californians moving in and the constant construction of condos, Portland still holds onto its weirdness.\n\nNow, \"weird\" doesn't mean everyone's always accepting, but it does mean embracing things that aren't exactly mainstream. It doesn't mean we're immune to modern life – we've got the same Chinese imports as everywhere else. There are a million ways to be \"not normal,\" and Portland has plenty of that. We've got yoga studios, hipsters, business types...maybe \"weird\" is just us taking it all a little less seriously.\n\nTake my neighborhood, for example. We've got colorful houses, gardens bursting with flowers and veggies, and these free boxes piled up in the summer. They're usually just cardboard boxes filled with stuff people are getting rid of, but sometimes it's plastic bags or whatever. It's like a treasure hunt – you never know what you'll find, clothes, books, maybe even something truly bizarre. That's the magic of wandering through Southeast Portland – you're bound to stumble upon something unexpected.\n\nThat's what Portland is all about, at least to me. But I'm just one small piece of the weird puzzle. Some folks wouldn't dream of picking clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. They're off doing goat yoga (yes, with real goats!) or cheering on the Timbers (our beloved soccer team). Portland is full of people chasing dreams, big or small, and probably a few too many folks spending their evenings at the bar.\n\nYeah, we've got drug problems. I mean, most places do, and it often boils down to mental health struggles. And the constant rain and gray skies probably don't help. We also have a homelessness problem, which no one seems to have a good solution for. People come here for the social services, which are better than in most places, but they're still not enough. The non-homeless folks are caught between wanting to help and feeling overwhelmed.\n\nSo, yeah, we're not perfect. We're weird, sure, but we're also human, struggling with the same issues as everyone else. But maybe that's part of the weird magic of Portland – embracing the messy, complicated, and ultimately beautiful reality of it all.",
            "The mountains, they're always there, you know?  North of everything, watching the sun rise and set every single day. I can get so caught up in work and life, forget about them entirely. But they're still there, solid, dependable, unbothered by any of my drama. On the days when stress just piles on, I find myself drawn to them. They're like a calming force, giving me a little boost to keep going, one step at a time.  \n\nI remember when I first moved here for college,  it was the mountains just north of campus that really hooked me. The university itself is stunning, with its buildings, ponds, and trees, all holding a special place in my heart. But the mountains? They're the real MVPs. \n\nThe town itself is pretty cool too.  It's got these awesome cafes - perfect for late-night study sessions fueled by caffeine. You can hop on a bus or take a quick walk to downtown, and suddenly you're surrounded by this old-school vibe, with faded brick buildings lining the streets. It's like a mini-city with its own energy, buzzing with life.  But just a few blocks later, you're back in that serene small-town atmosphere, passing by the library and all. It's this weird mix of vibes that makes this place so fascinating. \n\nIt's easy to make memories here, good and bad.  Walking past those rusty swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter, or racing through downtown to catch a movie at that fancy theater the university scored tickets for. But there are tough memories too, like those late-night existential crises by the ponds.  I've definitely had my share of those.\n\nWatching the turtles and ducks and bugs going about their lives, I'd get lost thinking about my own purpose, struggling to figure out this whole life thing. So, I'd walk past the pond, the park, those little houses that scream \"suburbia,\" until I hit the main street.  That's when the sun would hit the palm trees, painting the sky with its golden light, and I'd realize I was walking north.\n\nAnd there they were, the mountains, just as they always had been. Towering over everything else, they'd meet the blue and yellow sky, and somehow, just by being there, they'd reawaken this sense of hope inside me.",
            "Alright, so you're thinking about checking out Bensonhurst, huh? Don't sweat finding it, public transit's a breeze in this city. You'll definitely feel like you're in the heart of NYC, it's a proper urban vibe. \n\nGet ready for a serious dose of Asian culture, it's taken over the place in the last twenty years or so. Seriously, you won't walk a block without bumping into an Asian-owned store – supermarkets, laundromats, the whole shebang. And they're super popular, not just with the Asian community, but everyone. The food's top-notch, prices are killer, and it's just so damn convenient. I'm talking four Asian supermarkets within spitting distance of each other!  \n\nBut don't get the wrong idea, it's not just an Asian enclave. It's a melting pot, with immigrants and their families making it their home. You'll see a mix of everything, and the big businesses? Mostly Asian-owned.\n\nPlus, there's this super cool renovated park nearby with, like, ten basketball courts, a massive field for soccer or baseball, handball courts, swings, a kid's playground – the works. And a water fountain for those scorching summer days. It's a real community hub, you'll see all kinds of people chilling and having a good time.\n\nForget about towering corporate buildings, though. It's mostly co-ops, condos, and two-family houses. \n\nThe people are mostly friendly, but let me tell you, they're LOUD. Cars blaring music, revving engines – it's a symphony of city noise. Be prepared to wake up with a jolt some mornings!\n\nNow, Bensonhurst is generally safe, but you gotta be street smart, especially at night. There are always those unpredictable characters who might cause trouble for no reason.  I've been in a couple of sticky situations here myself, some years back. Package theft is also a thing, nothing new in the city, I guess.\n\nAnd one last thing – dog poop.  Ugh, it's everywhere! People don't seem to care about cleaning up after their pets. Be careful where you step, or you'll be dodging landmines all day long.",
            "Life up here on the hill is a bit... different.  There aren't any sidewalks, so everyone walks in the road, which is pockmarked and pretty rough in spots.  The power lines look like a patchwork quilt after all the storms and the falling branches.  You'd think they'd just take the old, tired trees down, but nope, people love to complain about them blocking the view of the ocean.  That's why so many houses are built high up, with these giant second-story windows trying to catch a glimpse of the water.  It's pretty spectacular at sunset when the bay glows and the sky turns orange, but most days it's cloudy and overcast, so the sunlight just kind of filters through.  You can see moss growing everywhere—roofs, cars, even railings.  I once had to spend three hours scraping moss off my car after leaving it parked for a month.\n\nThe neighborhood is mostly older folks, retired types.  Dogs are more common than kids, and they're always running around, barking, or snooping around for treats.  I had a dog sneak into my living room once!\n\nRabbits are another story.  They're everywhere, digging up gardens and lawns, but my cats love to chase them.  We've got the usual birds too—sparrows, hummingbirds, the occasional hawk or eagle that gets chased away by the neighborhood crows.\n\nThere aren't any shops around here, just a few seafood restaurants down by the waterfront if you're willing to hike down the hill.  The beach isn't much to write home about, but we like to chuck rocks into the bay.  It's not very wide, so you can see the other side even through the fog.",
            "I live on a typical suburban street in a small Southern town, Tennessee. It's right between two state highways, so we get more traffic than I'd prefer, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood.  People move in and out pretty rarely, so I've gotten to know most of the folks around here.  They keep themselves busy with yard work and daily chores, mostly. In the winter, we all sled down the hill on our side street. Our house sits on the corner, so we see everyone coming and going all day. We even know which cars belong to which neighbors. Whenever we spot something unusual, it catches our eye. \n\nSome neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids are out on their bikes, doing all the usual kid things. We're home a lot since we both work from home. It's just the four of us: me, my wife, and our two daughters, who are eleven and fourteen. So, everyone else is used to seeing us around too. We get outside and play, even in the rain sometimes. We fire up the grill on the back deck every now and then, and the smell of barbecue always fills the air.\n\nThere's always someone cutting grass – you can practically hear a lawnmower every day from March until about October, when the grass finally slows down. We have a ton of trees because the neighborhood used to be wooded, so there's plenty of shade, but come fall, we're raking and burning leaves constantly. I actually love the smell of burning leaves, so it's a good sign that fall is here. Lately, we haven't had much of a winter at all, so it's felt like a never-ending fall. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone's at the door, which doesn't happen often. I like to work on my truck and other projects in the garage, and when the garage doors are open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood.\n\nThings are pretty quiet around here on holidays. Thanksgiving brings some extended family, and there are cars parked everywhere. It's the same for Mother's Day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here.  If it weren't for the traffic, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is smack dab in the middle of the high desert, where it's all dirt, dirt, and more dirt. Unless you've actually lived here, you probably can't truly grasp the feeling of constantly seeing brown. And when you do spot a lawn, you know that person is shelling out a small fortune to keep it that way. Back in the 90s when I first moved here, houses were spread out like stars in the night sky. Now, it's still pretty spread out, but there are a ton of new houses popping up. Honestly, it's starting to look more like a city every day, but I guess that's the story everywhere these days. Most of the people here are super friendly, but like any place, you've got your good and bad parts. My neighborhood is surrounded by friendly old folks, so I guess that makes it a pretty decent place to live. \n\nAs for shopping, you're mostly stuck with chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart and Final. For anything upscale, you'd have to drive a good distance – no Whole Foods or anything like that around here.\n\nLooking at the job scene, it seems like construction is king. I'm guessing this is because the city's still pretty undeveloped, with tons of open space just begging to be built on. It kinda scares me, though. I like things the way they are now. I escaped the big city, and I'm not looking to go back anytime soon. Speaking of construction, that's actually where I work full-time. I'm a drywall and T-bar installer.\n\nWhat I love most about living here is the wildlife. People come to the high desert for all sorts of reasons, but the raw beauty of the desert itself is a big draw. The unique climate and landscape create challenging ecosystems that need protection and are home to all sorts of fascinating creatures. We, as human residents, should make an effort to learn about these non-human neighbors so we can co-exist peacefully. My family and I have definitely adapted to living with wildlife. My three kids are obsessed with lizards and desert bugs – right now, they're outside trying to catch some specimens!\n\nAs for attractions, we've got a few. Victorville is a great place for families looking for a unique desert experience. If you're visiting, try to time your trip with the annual San Bernardino County Fair. It's a blast with the perfect mix of activities and fun, Victorville style! \n\nFor something different, head over to nearby Wrightwood to see the snow-capped mountains and take some winter sports lessons. \n\nIf you're interested in the history and culture of this high desert ecosystem, check out the Victor Valley Museum. It's got geological and paleontological exhibits, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of Victorville's development.",
            "Okay, so when people ask me about my neighborhood, it's kinda different from what they're used to. Most folks probably picture houses and lawns, right?  Not me. My neighborhood is the college campus I live on. My dorm is my home base, and all the other students, they're my crew.  The whole campus, well, that's my neighborhood too, just on a bigger scale.  \n\nBut even though it's not your typical neighborhood, it's got the same stuff: houses, people, shops, and even a park. Let's talk about the \"houses\" first.  We've got apartments, regular houses, and dorm buildings.  Apartments are where you'll find groups of 2-4 people per room, usually 4-6 rooms per floor. A typical building has two floors, so maybe 20 people total. Then there are actual houses, like singles or doubles, mostly for alumni. But those are pretty rare around here.  And lastly, there are the dorms, packed with hundreds of students, two per room mostly.  Dorms are the most common place to live on campus.\n\nNow, about the people. My school's all about diversity, so my neighborhood is a melting pot.  You got folks from all walks of life, all ages.  The staff usually lives in those houses, newer students are in the dorms, and the older ones tend to go for apartments.  There's so much to say about the people here, but I'll save it for another time.\n\nOn campus, we're pretty self-sufficient.  We've got a ton of stores, everything from cafes to bookstores to the school's own brand of clothing and groceries.  It's like our own little world!  And don't forget the park. It's a safe space for everyone, kept clean and friendly by everyone who calls this place home.",
            "So, I've been living here for about 10 years now, and figured I'd share some of my experiences.  Moving from Riverdale to Stockbridge was rough at first.  I was pretty bummed,  I really missed my old neighborhood and friends, you know? But my parents wanted a better life for me and my little sister, so we moved for better schools, housing, and everything they thought was \"not ghetto.\"   It took a while to adjust, met some new people (both friends and frenemies at school), but I never really got to know my neighbors much, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis for a while since they lived right next door. They've been awesome, almost like family, and I'm really grateful for them.  I remember going to Mr. Glen's wedding with my parents and sister - it was a blast!  It made me think about my future and wanting to give my future wife the same kind of happiness.   There was this funny moment when Mr. Glen's wife, Ms. Veda, took off this little white strap on her leg and threw it, and I actually caught it! Sadly, I missed the bouquet though. We danced the night away, and I had a great time hanging out with Marsharii, one of their daughters. Haven't seen her since, but hope she's doing well. \n\nThis neighborhood is like a maze, but now with GPS, I'm ready to explore more. So far, I've mostly hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We were all about video games back in the day, just living it up. Sometimes I'd go to the park, which is super peaceful and calming. I even practice my balance with some sticks I got from Home Depot and sometimes bring my bokken wooden sword. It's fun doing the things I love.  There's also a basketball and tennis court, even though I haven't played in ages. It's cool to have them there just in case. My dad got me and my best friend into tennis with Mr. Graves, and we had a blast. They really pushed us, but it was always fun.  Looking back, I've had so many great times in this neighborhood, there are tons of stories! But these are the ones that really stick with me.  I know the best is yet to come!",
            "My digs are super close to my college, which is a major perk.  It's mostly apartments around here, with a sprinkle of decent, affordable restaurants and bars.  One bar just got a fancy name change and jacked up the prices, but the drinks aren't *that* bad. Most folks are chill, either students or on a budget since the rent's not astronomical. There are tons of kids around because there's an elementary school practically next door. I'm not exactly BFFs with my neighbors, though. They're the heavy weed-smoking type, so the building management put an air freshener unit right outside their door – talk about awkward! It's kinda insulting, to be honest.\n\nThe buildings around me are old-school, though they might have had a recent makeover inside. Down the street, there are these brand new apartments, but I can't stand them. They're poorly built, overpriced, and the management gets away with it because they're close to campus. It's a total scam! There's this cheap eats joint a few blocks away where everything comes on paper plates and most of it's microwaved.  Right next door is a gas station, which supposedly isn't a great place to work.  \n\nBut, they redid the road last summer thanks to some city cash, so now there's a nice sidewalk, tons of grass, and the whole area looks a bit nicer. My building itself is kind of hidden away by trees – they cut down a few, but there are still plenty left. Behind the complex is a line of trees, then another set of apartments. I'm on 42nd Street, but right behind me is 43rd, which is a bit rougher. The sidewalks are crumbling, the buildings look shabby, and there are tons of trees, probably to hide the eyesores! Most of the trouble in the area seems to be coming from an apartment complex on 43rd, but to be fair, the apartments across the street from me aren't exactly angels either – a lot of crime and a revolving door of tenants.\n\nDespite all that, I actually kinda like where I live. It's affordable, convenient, and I'm close to the university and bus stops.",
            "My neighborhood's a real throwback. It's got these duplexes lined up on a cul-de-sac, spaced out so they look like individual houses.  They all share the same yellow paint, white porches, and green metal roofs, though.  Most of the folks here know each other pretty well. We hang out at the end of driveways, shooting the breeze while the kids play – sidewalk chalk, kites, the usual. It's a nice change of pace from the constant screens and hustle of modern life. Feels like stepping back in time, surrounded by fields, trees, and endless blue skies dotted with puffy clouds. The only bummer? We've been getting tornado warnings lately, and last night, those sirens actually went off! Ended up in the bathtub with my little dog, my purse, and some pillows – you know, the essentials. My big dog, though? He wasn't having it. Stuck in the living room, barking his head off, clearly spooked. You could hear the hail pounding on the ground, and after the storm, the street was practically steaming from the temperature swing. Went from 92 degrees to 75 in minutes – the hail melted instantly. Then, as the clouds cleared, the sun came out and started raining again. And wouldn't you know it, a double rainbow appeared! I grabbed my camera and snapped some pics to share with everyone. They were blown away, and so was I. The neighborhood was quiet for a while after the storm, then folks started trickling back home. Back to normal – kids playing, moms chatting, dinner cooking. This place has been a real blessing for me since I moved here from New Hampshire. Love the Southern drawl, gotta admit. \n\nEveryone's got a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, but they're not all the same inside.  Some are surprisingly tiny.  I love taking walks out to the big field behind my place and heading down to the pond (not for swimming, though).  I've spotted deer and in the mornings, you can hear this giant bullfrog croaking his heart out. It's a great place to live, just a hop, skip, and a jump from Charlotte.  Every morning starts with the sound of roosters crowing from the nearby farms. Feels like living in a little village, actually.  There's even a donkey at a farm down the road that brays every evening to let us know he's around. So glad I stumbled upon this little gem of a neighborhood.",
            "So, I moved into this neighborhood right when eighth grade started, and it took a bit to make friends. I ended up getting close to a couple of guys, one lives a couple houses down, and the other's on my street, but they've both moved on now.  Still, the memories stick around. Most of the folks who were here when I first got here are still around, which is cool.  The neighborhood's pretty typical – lots of two-story houses, you know, the standard suburban thing. On sunny days, you can always hear kids playing outside – it's a pretty chill place, mostly quiet during the week.  I've never had any issues with anyone here, folks are pretty much left to their own devices unless they need something. Never had a package stolen off my porch either, so I feel pretty safe.\n\nThere's this park just a hop, skip, and a jump from my place, and it's got a ton of memories attached to it.  Played tons of basketball, football, and baseball there with the neighborhood guys back in the day. Had a pretty brutal moment too, got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good times definitely outweigh the bad. Nowadays, I mostly go there with my cousin's kids – they're way younger and still into swings and slides and whatnot. Just seeing the park gets them super excited, which is kinda heartwarming. It definitely makes me nostalgic for that part of my life.\n\nThis neighborhood's got a good mix of people from all walks of life. You can find all sorts of food places within a mile – Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian, the works.  These days, everyone's using apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered, though. Fast food is pretty popular here, like pretty much anywhere, and there are tons of pizza places too.  \n\nThere are plenty of stores around here for everything you could need – dry cleaners, Walgreens, CVS, even a Jewel-Osco, which is a big deal in the Midwest. You can even find a store owned by some folks from India, perfect for getting some homemade or ready-made Indian food if you're feeling adventurous.\n\nOverall, I'm pretty happy with my neighborhood. Hearing all the crazy stories about bad neighbors on social media and the news, I feel really lucky to have the ones I do.",
            "My town, Johnston, is like a lot of other small towns in South Carolina. It's pretty unassuming, but it's known for one big thing: peaches!  Everyone here takes pride in the fact that Johnston is the \"Peach Capital of the World,\" and you'll see that slogan plastered all over town. It's mostly just farmland, either peach orchards or cattle grazing.  \n\nThe houses are spread out, most are two stories with metal roofs to beat the heat or gray shingles. They're usually set back from the road, leaving space in front for animals or crops.  The main part of town is where you'll find the only stoplight, which controls traffic at a four-way intersection.  That's also where all the stores are.\n\nFor \"fast food,\" you've got Hong Kong (a tiny Chinese place run by a family), Fiesta Mexican, or Gary's, a small burger chain. We used to have a pizza place, but it closed not too long ago. There's a small, family-owned pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, known for their Cherry Coca-Cola.  Then there's IGA, the only grocery store in town, which is a bit pricey. People often drive to Batesburg-Leesville to Walmart for their main grocery shopping.  But, the most popular store is probably Dollar General. It's always busy because it's got everything you need!\n\nThere's also a furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a lovely lady who's a fixture in the community. It's been around forever and even has movers to deliver your purchases! Attached to the furniture store is a pet groomer, Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They offer daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, baths, you name it. The doctor's office and the vet are both small but well-equipped, located away from the main town area.  We have one elementary school, Johnston Elementary, but after fifth grade, kids have to go to the next town for middle and high school.\n\nWe don't really have any parks, although they're trying to build a small recreation area. There aren't any movie theaters, bowling alleys, or places to just hang out. It's pretty quiet here.\n\nBut, despite all that, it's a nice town. It's so small you could easily drive through it without even realizing you were in a town at all!",
            "My first encounter with this place was through a podcast about missing persons, which was a bit of a shock.  Rent for apartments around here skyrockets past a thousand bucks a month, and I'd never heard a peep about any disappearances, neither had my buddies. Maybe it's the cost of living getting to folks. I know a few friends who end up crying themselves to sleep over money worries. Things are pricey, but we've learned to be resourceful over time. You start to get used to the musty scent of flea market toys and clothes that have been mothballed for years. You smell less as an adult, you might pick up smoking, or maybe you just get used to the state of things. But the flea market feeling always sneaks back. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines piled on a closed piano. It gets stuck in the leather and lingers even after washing.  \n\nThere are at least three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start at one end, you can hit up two charity shops, a library, a rare book store, and a place full of oddities.  Downtown's a bustling hive of cars and people every morning, but inside those thrift stores, it's silent. No matter how many people or cars zip by, the silence holds. It's a perfect spot to lose track of an afternoon. Every year, more and more of those places pop up. Cars and people flood the streets. It's a growing city, they say. Hosting one of the biggest online empires for shopping and delivery, it's still going through growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone's focused on their own goals, and nobody expects much from anyone else. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you be. It's not like the South, where a little concern means you really care. People here don't pry into each other's lives. You can keep your walls up as long as you want, and the city just rolls along like waves on the beach. It's a vibrant place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur singers upstairs, there's always something happening. In a way, we're less like an apartment building full of strangers and more like a community of friends. We come together for birthdays, funerals, and to help each other out when needed.  \n\nI'm lucky to be here, honestly. I like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I try to keep things tidy, leave them snacks, and they do the same for me. We trade mail, and it's nice to see each other. I think they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, impersonal modern complex, but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't completely mess things up.",
            "My neighborhood is like, the definition of cookie-cutter suburbia. You know, the kind where the homeowner's association is basically running the show.  Step inside, and it's a parade of identical single-family homes, all perfectly manicured lawns, matching driveways, and those little patches of pebbles everyone loves.  Oh, and don't forget the two-car garages, standard issue for every house.   You'll be cruising down these freshly paved roads, and it's like, zero potholes in sight.  Most houses are single-story, but sometimes you'll bump into a two-story one.  Mailboxes are a little different here too. No individual boxes out front, instead, it's more like an apartment building deal – a big cluster of mailboxes at the end of the street, everyone using a key to grab their own. And there are these giant lockers for packages, just in case those aren't small enough.  Thanks, HOA, for keeping things, well, *uniform*.\n\nLiving on the outskirts of the city, my neighborhood's kind of a mix of suburbia and rural.  We've got a ton of space.\n\nMultiple community pools, all gated and sparkling clean.  And these walking trails that snake through the neighborhood, perfect for your daily dog walk or a quiet evening stroll. No need to find a park, you can just run laps around the whole place.  Most people here are retired folks, super friendly and always looking out for each other.  You've got your share of middle-aged and young professionals mixed in too.  \n\nThe city itself is surprisingly big, but it's got that small-town vibe.  We've got the essentials, like one mall (not huge, but it gets the job done).  About a 15-minute drive gets you to all the big box stores you could ever want, from fancy organic grocery stores to those bargain outlets with barely any staff. \n\nAll in all, my neighborhood's pretty typical, safe, well-kept, and boring.  Nice things, like pools and trails, but not exactly a party scene.  You want something, hop in the car and it’s a quick trip to whatever chain store you need.",
            "I call this small Midwestern town home, just outside a big city's suburbs. My neighborhood, on the east side, is the least wealthy part of town. Houses are mostly rented or owned by folks who aren't rolling in dough. But it's not a bad place to live. My neighbors are mostly friendly folks who wave and say hello when I'm out and about. Sure, crime rates are a tad higher than in other parts of town, but they're not out of control. There have been a few violent incidents nearby over the past decade, including some shootings and even a homicide. Our next-door neighbors lost their son last year in a shooting outside a local bar, which was heartbreaking. Luckily, our family has stayed safe, though we've had the occasional porch pirate make off with something if we're not careful.\n\nThe \"opioid epidemic\" has hit our town pretty hard, like a lot of places in the US. It's stolen too many lives due to fentanyl overdoses. Thankfully, there are resources here, like rehab centers and Narcan training for families and friends dealing with addiction. \n\nDespite these struggles, there's a lot to love about our town. My son's elementary school has a fantastic staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. He's thrived there, even with his special needs, because the school has such a positive atmosphere, and he hasn't faced any bullying. We have a super active Parent Teacher Organization that throws events all year to get families involved and boost learning.  Since over 20% of our town lives below the poverty line, the school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so no kid goes hungry. They make sure no one feels less than because they can't afford things, and school fees, supplies, and field trips are really reasonable.\n\nThe City Council has put effort into sprucing up town, repaving roads, landscaping, and fixing up parks. Most of these improvements are downtown and on the west side, where the shops and traffic are. The east side, where I live, tends to get overlooked, which a lot of people in our neighborhood find frustrating.\n\nOverall, I'm happy living here. People are friendly, the schools are great, we've got enough shopping options (both small businesses and big chains) to get what we need, and our house might not be worth much, but it's comfortable and fits our family. We've been here for over 16 years, and can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is bursting with character. It's perched on a hill, surrounded by buildings with stories to tell. I live in a seven-story apartment building right across from the old live theater, and just down the street is this awesome little arcade bar that draws all sorts of people on warm summer nights. You'll often see a line snaking down the block, especially on weekends during June and July. A few blocks up is the nearest city park, surprisingly spacious for the area. It's surrounded by concrete with steep stairs built right into the wall. During the harsh winter months, homeless people set up tidy rows of tents along the sidewalk and those wide stairs. It doesn't snow much, but the rainstorms in mid-winter can be brutal, making it tough to stay warm.  Clustering their tents together in the heart of town instead of out in the open keeps them warmer and they're within walking distance of the only family center for miles, where they can shower and clean up. What I truly love about my city, though, isn't the beauty of its history – the towering buildings, the architecture that climbs the hills rolling down to the ocean. It's the people that make my neighborhood special.  Hilltop used to be the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. Even three decades later, you still hear stories about the feds and the DEA cracking down, trying to clean up the streets. The people remember. Those stories are passed down through generations, even to newcomers like me. They work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher areas in the city, to keep it clean and safe. They care about their city, their block. People say if you're white, you shouldn't walk around Hilltop after dark. I think it's a relic of the old days, tinged with the bitterness of social conditioning. Maybe because I'm dark enough to pass for something other than a \"white girl,\" or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of their own, someone who understands the constant reminders of racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions that stem from ignorance and fear, even in a city that's supposed to be a melting pot of cultures. One thing's for sure: no matter where I go, Hilltop will always feel like home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more often offered me a jacket than tried to rob me. It's a place where the laundromat owner stayed open late so I could charge my phone when I was caught in the rain. It's a place where, huddled against a concrete storefront on a bleak night, I felt invisible, only to have someone stop, look me in the eye, hand me five dollars, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I call home a little slice of Rural America, specifically a small town in Michigan. You'll find fields of crops transitioning into quaint tourist spots, but forget big city amenities like malls, Wal-Mart, Target, or even an Applebee's.  Getting around means hopping in the car because everything's a drive.  Even with that,  I think I live in one of the most beautiful places on Earth, surrounded by water. My town sits snuggled between Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix –  think beaches just steps away no matter where you are. \n\nMy neighborhood screams \"small town USA.\" Houses aren't crammed together, and they're not those cookie-cutter creations. They're older homes, some spruced up and modernized, others keeping their vintage charm. Most have full basements you can easily spot from the street.  You'll see a mix of aluminum siding, with houses painted in every color imaginable lining the streets. Most have yards, complete with trampolines, playsets, gardens, and fences for the family pets. They paint a picture of hard-working folks, raising families or enjoying the fruits of their labor. \n\nKids zoom up and down the sidewalks, you'll spot people walking dogs, biking, or rollerblading.  There's a real sense of community here; neighbors know each other, and you can quickly tell who belongs and who's just passing through.  You'll see someone grilling out and get a friendly wave, or a passerby walking their dog will offer a warm smile. Lawns are well-kept; no piles of leaves, just neat, mowed grass and trimmed bushes. It's not about flashy mansions, but about a place that feels like home. It's quiet, peaceful, and safe – a place you'd want to raise a family. \n\nThe county sheriff's department and jail are within walking distance, followed by the health department. The city's recycling center is just down the road, serving residents from all corners. Nearby, you'll find baseball and softball fields, where you can hear the excitement of the announcers and the cheers of the crowd. Our small town airport sits right next to it, so you'll hear the rumble of small planes taking off and landing, whether you're inside or outside.  A quick stroll takes you to the local ice cream shop, and if you're feeling ambitious, you can bike or walk into downtown.\n\nMy kids can ride their bikes to the park, just eight blocks away. It's a truly great place to live."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "My neighborhood in this big city is a real melting pot, with residential areas scattered randomly amongst shops and businesses. You've got your typical office buildings, but also all kinds of stores, restaurants, and entertainment spots.  There's always something new to try, whether it's a fancy chain store or a cool little boutique popping up on every corner. These boutiques aren't just found in malls, they've taken over the streets, adding some buzz to quieter neighborhoods.  \n\nAnd speaking of buzz, there are a couple of parks nearby that are always packed with families. As for the people, my neighborhood is a crazy mix. We've got a strong LGBTQ+ presence, a big Orthodox Jewish community, and a bunch of immigrants from the former Soviet Union all living together.\n\nVenture a little further out, and you'll find even more diverse pockets, like Korea Town, China Town, Little Armenia, and so on.  They're all just a short drive away, but \"short\" can be a relative term in this city. Ten miles can easily turn into a two-hour nightmare thanks to rush hour traffic. \n\nIt's a car-centric place, so most people don't walk around much. Since everything is spread out, even places that seem close can be a pain to get to on foot.  This leads to some of the worst traffic in the world and a never-ending search for parking. Ironically, they're building tons of new apartments, which is great for attracting more people, but not so great for those of us who are already here and struggling with the traffic and parking.\n\nBut hey, at least there's variety in housing. You've got your massive apartment buildings, but also tons of houses, duplexes, smaller apartment complexes, and everything in between.  It's a mixed bag in terms of people too.  I don't really know most of my neighbors, it's not exactly a close-knit community anymore. Back in the day, though, we used to play outside all the time with the kids from the neighborhood. Those were the days.",
            "My neighborhood is a fascinating blend of old and new. Most of the homes are traditional single-family houses, though a few have been divided into two separate units while still sharing a wall. My own place has a small front yard and a tiny driveway. It's the kind of house that whispers of a bygone era when suburban living was the quintessential American dream.  A dream that once felt inclusive, but now seems to be slipping away. Yet, my neighborhood, along with countless others like it, still holds out hope, still calls to us, reminding us that the dream endures. \n\nWhile the optimism might not be as bright as it once was, and the yards aren't always perfectly manicured, there are still cars in every driveway, and kids playing as if they own the world. The old public school, a landmark for nearly 90 years, stands tall, offering a glimpse of the future to today's youth while stirring up memories for the older generation. \n\nChurches are scarce, mostly empty now, but the basketball courts are always buzzing with activity. Every house looks different, yet they share a common feeling, a sense of shared history. There's a large supermarket, \"Super A,\" run by a large Yemeni family, likely the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The majority of residents are African American, with families who have lived here for generations, their stories weaving a tapestry of a time when everyone knew everyone else. \n\nThere used to be a karate school, but when Hollywood moved on from \"The Karate Kid,\" the kids lost interest, and it's now a pharmacy – because, as they say, drugs solve everything. There's also a small movie theater showing classic films at discounted prices. It's a haven for the older generation, who appreciate a night out without the distractions of today's blockbusters, while the youth look down upon its lack of new releases.\n\nA single expressway cuts through our town, technically entering and exiting in the neighboring town. We once tried to get our own exit, but the youth supported it, while the elders opposed it, arguing that it would ruin our town's charm. They eventually convinced the city council to deny our request. Now, a new high school is being built, and we're debating a mascot. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the perfect symbol for our town – a quirky blend of tradition and progress.",
            "You might overlook it at first glance. It's tucked behind a shopping strip in a residential area, not exactly a place you'd expect to find vibrant living spaces. Not the kind of place most people would choose to live. But if you venture past the old, deserted Whole Foods and behind the hotels that mostly stand empty except for occasional family reunions in the summer, you'll stumble upon a thriving community.  \n\nDown these hidden streets, nestled together like disassembled Russian nesting dolls, are a few apartment complexes. The first ones you encounter have a somewhat shady reputation, so let's not dwell on them. Appearances can be deceiving, right? But the complexes next to those, and the ones after that, are worlds apart, unknown to most people in the area.  \n\nAcross from these apartments sits a quiet satellite campus of a community college. Sleepy students shuffle in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to start their day. The iron gates creak open to let them in one by one, while commuters give them the stink eye and grumble about the traffic delays on busier mornings. The road then intersects with another residential street, where a park sits on one side and a rehabilitation center for people recovering from injuries stands on the other. The center boasts cheerful porch furniture and a lazy ceiling fan that stirs up the thick summer air. \n\nKids zoom around the park across the street, cartwheeling and playing tag. Bees buzz lazily around the flowerbeds by the road. Older folks walk their dogs along the path, giving teenagers on skateboards a disapproving look and politely nodding at young girls gathered by the playground, gossiping about boys and the latest trends. There's a sushi spot in a nearby strip mall with affordable food but not always a packed crowd. Next to it, a swimming supply store, and a nail salon tucked between them. You could fill your pool for the season, get a manicure, and enjoy some hibachi chicken, all in one stop - the magic of a strip mall. And don't forget the frozen yogurt place, the DIY kind, where you often see teenagers from the park clutching cold cups covered in toppings while they show off their skateboarding skills and vape, convinced it makes them cool. \n\nThis neighborhood is a slice of classic Americana - a piece of history in sleepy southern town where time seems to stand still.",
            "She asked, \"Where is everything?\" as we drove past endless cornfields stretching as far as the eye could see.  I knew she'd be stunned by the vast emptiness of the landscape. She grew up in a town where the grocery store was just a stone's throw away, so this much open space was completely foreign to her. Overwhelmed by the sea of corn, I told her about growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood where I came from. \n\nAs we continued down the two-lane road, you'd reach a quarry filled with water. Just past it lies the small development I call home. Mostly brick and stucco houses, each with at least half an acre of land, take pride of place.  Springtime explodes with color from the flowers planted each year, alongside the ever-changing hues of the Midwestern trees. Gleaming Mercedes Benzes, the epitome of luxury, fill the driveways, sparkling in the midday sun after a good wash.\n\nNear my grey stucco house, my Korean neighbor always greets me with a warm smile. He spends his days meticulously tending to his lawn, his laughter often accompanying the hum of his lawnmower. Everyone finds his dedication amusing, but he's a genuinely kind soul with a fascinating past.  He's a bit older now, his wit slightly dimmed by time. Once a doctor, he blends seamlessly with the grass and his John Deere Zero Turn mower.\n\nFinally, we reach my house. Geese roam the side yard, chased by our energetic Terrier. Out back, a small stream flows into the quarry, where bullfrogs croak, the water murmurs, and the occasional \"moo\" from nearby farms reaches our ears.  A handmade wooden bridge leads to a secluded oasis untouched by human hands.  Here, trees, herbs, and wildflowers grow wild and free. This was my childhood playground. From building tree forts to 'hunting' (mostly chasing) animals, there was always something to do, and a neighborhood friend was always around.\n\nWinters in our small town are harsh but breathtaking.  The green yard transforms into a desolate wilderness. Trees, once adorned with vibrant flowers, stand bare, skeletal against the sky. When snow falls, it blankets everything in a magical white layer. Snow angels and snowmen line the backyard, remnants of my sister and I's childhood battles. We fought constantly, and during winter, snowballs were our weapons of choice. We built massive, igloo-like forts to store our arsenal of branches, creating our own winter wonderland. In that world, pretending was everything, and we were just carefree kids.",
            "You gotta get Portland, Oregon. \"Keep Portland Weird,\" it says on a building that's basically a pizza place, bar, music venue, and, well, let's just say it pushes the boundaries a little. Some folks see it as a throwback to the '90s and early 2000s, a time before Portland got famous and pricey, when all sorts of unique subcultures thrived. For others, it's a call to adventure – come to Portland, where \"weird\" isn't a bad thing, it's a badge of honor. Even with all the fancy Californians moving in and the constant construction of condos, Portland still holds onto its weirdness.\n\nNow, \"weird\" doesn't mean everyone's always accepting, but it does mean embracing things that aren't exactly mainstream. It doesn't mean we're immune to modern life – we've got the same Chinese imports as everywhere else. There are a million ways to be \"not normal,\" and Portland has plenty of that. We've got yoga studios, hipsters, business types...maybe \"weird\" is just us taking it all a little less seriously.\n\nTake my neighborhood, for example. We've got colorful houses, gardens bursting with flowers and veggies, and these free boxes piled up in the summer. They're usually just cardboard boxes filled with stuff people are getting rid of, but sometimes it's plastic bags or whatever. It's like a treasure hunt – you never know what you'll find, clothes, books, maybe even something truly bizarre. That's the magic of wandering through Southeast Portland – you're bound to stumble upon something unexpected.\n\nThat's what Portland is all about, at least to me. But I'm just one small piece of the weird puzzle. Some folks wouldn't dream of picking clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. They're off doing goat yoga (yes, with real goats!) or cheering on the Timbers (our beloved soccer team). Portland is full of people chasing dreams, big or small, and probably a few too many folks spending their evenings at the bar.\n\nYeah, we've got drug problems. I mean, most places do, and it often boils down to mental health struggles. And the constant rain and gray skies probably don't help. We also have a homelessness problem, which no one seems to have a good solution for. People come here for the social services, which are better than in most places, but they're still not enough. The non-homeless folks are caught between wanting to help and feeling overwhelmed.\n\nSo, yeah, we're not perfect. We're weird, sure, but we're also human, struggling with the same issues as everyone else. But maybe that's part of the weird magic of Portland – embracing the messy, complicated, and ultimately beautiful reality of it all.",
            "The mountains, they're always there, you know?  North of everything, watching the sun rise and set every single day. I can get so caught up in work and life, forget about them entirely. But they're still there, solid, dependable, unbothered by any of my drama. On the days when stress just piles on, I find myself drawn to them. They're like a calming force, giving me a little boost to keep going, one step at a time.  \n\nI remember when I first moved here for college,  it was the mountains just north of campus that really hooked me. The university itself is stunning, with its buildings, ponds, and trees, all holding a special place in my heart. But the mountains? They're the real MVPs. \n\nThe town itself is pretty cool too.  It's got these awesome cafes - perfect for late-night study sessions fueled by caffeine. You can hop on a bus or take a quick walk to downtown, and suddenly you're surrounded by this old-school vibe, with faded brick buildings lining the streets. It's like a mini-city with its own energy, buzzing with life.  But just a few blocks later, you're back in that serene small-town atmosphere, passing by the library and all. It's this weird mix of vibes that makes this place so fascinating. \n\nIt's easy to make memories here, good and bad.  Walking past those rusty swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter, or racing through downtown to catch a movie at that fancy theater the university scored tickets for. But there are tough memories too, like those late-night existential crises by the ponds.  I've definitely had my share of those.\n\nWatching the turtles and ducks and bugs going about their lives, I'd get lost thinking about my own purpose, struggling to figure out this whole life thing. So, I'd walk past the pond, the park, those little houses that scream \"suburbia,\" until I hit the main street.  That's when the sun would hit the palm trees, painting the sky with its golden light, and I'd realize I was walking north.\n\nAnd there they were, the mountains, just as they always had been. Towering over everything else, they'd meet the blue and yellow sky, and somehow, just by being there, they'd reawaken this sense of hope inside me.",
            "Alright, so you're thinking about checking out Bensonhurst, huh? Don't sweat finding it, public transit's a breeze in this city. You'll definitely feel like you're in the heart of NYC, it's a proper urban vibe. \n\nGet ready for a serious dose of Asian culture, it's taken over the place in the last twenty years or so. Seriously, you won't walk a block without bumping into an Asian-owned store – supermarkets, laundromats, the whole shebang. And they're super popular, not just with the Asian community, but everyone. The food's top-notch, prices are killer, and it's just so damn convenient. I'm talking four Asian supermarkets within spitting distance of each other!  \n\nBut don't get the wrong idea, it's not just an Asian enclave. It's a melting pot, with immigrants and their families making it their home. You'll see a mix of everything, and the big businesses? Mostly Asian-owned.\n\nPlus, there's this super cool renovated park nearby with, like, ten basketball courts, a massive field for soccer or baseball, handball courts, swings, a kid's playground – the works. And a water fountain for those scorching summer days. It's a real community hub, you'll see all kinds of people chilling and having a good time.\n\nForget about towering corporate buildings, though. It's mostly co-ops, condos, and two-family houses. \n\nThe people are mostly friendly, but let me tell you, they're LOUD. Cars blaring music, revving engines – it's a symphony of city noise. Be prepared to wake up with a jolt some mornings!\n\nNow, Bensonhurst is generally safe, but you gotta be street smart, especially at night. There are always those unpredictable characters who might cause trouble for no reason.  I've been in a couple of sticky situations here myself, some years back. Package theft is also a thing, nothing new in the city, I guess.\n\nAnd one last thing – dog poop.  Ugh, it's everywhere! People don't seem to care about cleaning up after their pets. Be careful where you step, or you'll be dodging landmines all day long.",
            "Life up here on the hill is a bit... different.  There aren't any sidewalks, so everyone walks in the road, which is pockmarked and pretty rough in spots.  The power lines look like a patchwork quilt after all the storms and the falling branches.  You'd think they'd just take the old, tired trees down, but nope, people love to complain about them blocking the view of the ocean.  That's why so many houses are built high up, with these giant second-story windows trying to catch a glimpse of the water.  It's pretty spectacular at sunset when the bay glows and the sky turns orange, but most days it's cloudy and overcast, so the sunlight just kind of filters through.  You can see moss growing everywhere—roofs, cars, even railings.  I once had to spend three hours scraping moss off my car after leaving it parked for a month.\n\nThe neighborhood is mostly older folks, retired types.  Dogs are more common than kids, and they're always running around, barking, or snooping around for treats.  I had a dog sneak into my living room once!\n\nRabbits are another story.  They're everywhere, digging up gardens and lawns, but my cats love to chase them.  We've got the usual birds too—sparrows, hummingbirds, the occasional hawk or eagle that gets chased away by the neighborhood crows.\n\nThere aren't any shops around here, just a few seafood restaurants down by the waterfront if you're willing to hike down the hill.  The beach isn't much to write home about, but we like to chuck rocks into the bay.  It's not very wide, so you can see the other side even through the fog.",
            "I live on a typical suburban street in a small Southern town, Tennessee. It's right between two state highways, so we get more traffic than I'd prefer, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood.  People move in and out pretty rarely, so I've gotten to know most of the folks around here.  They keep themselves busy with yard work and daily chores, mostly. In the winter, we all sled down the hill on our side street. Our house sits on the corner, so we see everyone coming and going all day. We even know which cars belong to which neighbors. Whenever we spot something unusual, it catches our eye. \n\nSome neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids are out on their bikes, doing all the usual kid things. We're home a lot since we both work from home. It's just the four of us: me, my wife, and our two daughters, who are eleven and fourteen. So, everyone else is used to seeing us around too. We get outside and play, even in the rain sometimes. We fire up the grill on the back deck every now and then, and the smell of barbecue always fills the air.\n\nThere's always someone cutting grass – you can practically hear a lawnmower every day from March until about October, when the grass finally slows down. We have a ton of trees because the neighborhood used to be wooded, so there's plenty of shade, but come fall, we're raking and burning leaves constantly. I actually love the smell of burning leaves, so it's a good sign that fall is here. Lately, we haven't had much of a winter at all, so it's felt like a never-ending fall. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone's at the door, which doesn't happen often. I like to work on my truck and other projects in the garage, and when the garage doors are open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood.\n\nThings are pretty quiet around here on holidays. Thanksgiving brings some extended family, and there are cars parked everywhere. It's the same for Mother's Day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here.  If it weren't for the traffic, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is smack dab in the middle of the high desert, where it's all dirt, dirt, and more dirt. Unless you've actually lived here, you probably can't truly grasp the feeling of constantly seeing brown. And when you do spot a lawn, you know that person is shelling out a small fortune to keep it that way. Back in the 90s when I first moved here, houses were spread out like stars in the night sky. Now, it's still pretty spread out, but there are a ton of new houses popping up. Honestly, it's starting to look more like a city every day, but I guess that's the story everywhere these days. Most of the people here are super friendly, but like any place, you've got your good and bad parts. My neighborhood is surrounded by friendly old folks, so I guess that makes it a pretty decent place to live. \n\nAs for shopping, you're mostly stuck with chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart and Final. For anything upscale, you'd have to drive a good distance – no Whole Foods or anything like that around here.\n\nLooking at the job scene, it seems like construction is king. I'm guessing this is because the city's still pretty undeveloped, with tons of open space just begging to be built on. It kinda scares me, though. I like things the way they are now. I escaped the big city, and I'm not looking to go back anytime soon. Speaking of construction, that's actually where I work full-time. I'm a drywall and T-bar installer.\n\nWhat I love most about living here is the wildlife. People come to the high desert for all sorts of reasons, but the raw beauty of the desert itself is a big draw. The unique climate and landscape create challenging ecosystems that need protection and are home to all sorts of fascinating creatures. We, as human residents, should make an effort to learn about these non-human neighbors so we can co-exist peacefully. My family and I have definitely adapted to living with wildlife. My three kids are obsessed with lizards and desert bugs – right now, they're outside trying to catch some specimens!\n\nAs for attractions, we've got a few. Victorville is a great place for families looking for a unique desert experience. If you're visiting, try to time your trip with the annual San Bernardino County Fair. It's a blast with the perfect mix of activities and fun, Victorville style! \n\nFor something different, head over to nearby Wrightwood to see the snow-capped mountains and take some winter sports lessons. \n\nIf you're interested in the history and culture of this high desert ecosystem, check out the Victor Valley Museum. It's got geological and paleontological exhibits, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of Victorville's development.",
            "Okay, so when people ask me about my neighborhood, it's kinda different from what they're used to. Most folks probably picture houses and lawns, right?  Not me. My neighborhood is the college campus I live on. My dorm is my home base, and all the other students, they're my crew.  The whole campus, well, that's my neighborhood too, just on a bigger scale.  \n\nBut even though it's not your typical neighborhood, it's got the same stuff: houses, people, shops, and even a park. Let's talk about the \"houses\" first.  We've got apartments, regular houses, and dorm buildings.  Apartments are where you'll find groups of 2-4 people per room, usually 4-6 rooms per floor. A typical building has two floors, so maybe 20 people total. Then there are actual houses, like singles or doubles, mostly for alumni. But those are pretty rare around here.  And lastly, there are the dorms, packed with hundreds of students, two per room mostly.  Dorms are the most common place to live on campus.\n\nNow, about the people. My school's all about diversity, so my neighborhood is a melting pot.  You got folks from all walks of life, all ages.  The staff usually lives in those houses, newer students are in the dorms, and the older ones tend to go for apartments.  There's so much to say about the people here, but I'll save it for another time.\n\nOn campus, we're pretty self-sufficient.  We've got a ton of stores, everything from cafes to bookstores to the school's own brand of clothing and groceries.  It's like our own little world!  And don't forget the park. It's a safe space for everyone, kept clean and friendly by everyone who calls this place home.",
            "So, I've been living here for about 10 years now, and figured I'd share some of my experiences.  Moving from Riverdale to Stockbridge was rough at first.  I was pretty bummed,  I really missed my old neighborhood and friends, you know? But my parents wanted a better life for me and my little sister, so we moved for better schools, housing, and everything they thought was \"not ghetto.\"   It took a while to adjust, met some new people (both friends and frenemies at school), but I never really got to know my neighbors much, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis for a while since they lived right next door. They've been awesome, almost like family, and I'm really grateful for them.  I remember going to Mr. Glen's wedding with my parents and sister - it was a blast!  It made me think about my future and wanting to give my future wife the same kind of happiness.   There was this funny moment when Mr. Glen's wife, Ms. Veda, took off this little white strap on her leg and threw it, and I actually caught it! Sadly, I missed the bouquet though. We danced the night away, and I had a great time hanging out with Marsharii, one of their daughters. Haven't seen her since, but hope she's doing well. \n\nThis neighborhood is like a maze, but now with GPS, I'm ready to explore more. So far, I've mostly hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We were all about video games back in the day, just living it up. Sometimes I'd go to the park, which is super peaceful and calming. I even practice my balance with some sticks I got from Home Depot and sometimes bring my bokken wooden sword. It's fun doing the things I love.  There's also a basketball and tennis court, even though I haven't played in ages. It's cool to have them there just in case. My dad got me and my best friend into tennis with Mr. Graves, and we had a blast. They really pushed us, but it was always fun.  Looking back, I've had so many great times in this neighborhood, there are tons of stories! But these are the ones that really stick with me.  I know the best is yet to come!",
            "My digs are super close to my college, which is a major perk.  It's mostly apartments around here, with a sprinkle of decent, affordable restaurants and bars.  One bar just got a fancy name change and jacked up the prices, but the drinks aren't *that* bad. Most folks are chill, either students or on a budget since the rent's not astronomical. There are tons of kids around because there's an elementary school practically next door. I'm not exactly BFFs with my neighbors, though. They're the heavy weed-smoking type, so the building management put an air freshener unit right outside their door – talk about awkward! It's kinda insulting, to be honest.\n\nThe buildings around me are old-school, though they might have had a recent makeover inside. Down the street, there are these brand new apartments, but I can't stand them. They're poorly built, overpriced, and the management gets away with it because they're close to campus. It's a total scam! There's this cheap eats joint a few blocks away where everything comes on paper plates and most of it's microwaved.  Right next door is a gas station, which supposedly isn't a great place to work.  \n\nBut, they redid the road last summer thanks to some city cash, so now there's a nice sidewalk, tons of grass, and the whole area looks a bit nicer. My building itself is kind of hidden away by trees – they cut down a few, but there are still plenty left. Behind the complex is a line of trees, then another set of apartments. I'm on 42nd Street, but right behind me is 43rd, which is a bit rougher. The sidewalks are crumbling, the buildings look shabby, and there are tons of trees, probably to hide the eyesores! Most of the trouble in the area seems to be coming from an apartment complex on 43rd, but to be fair, the apartments across the street from me aren't exactly angels either – a lot of crime and a revolving door of tenants.\n\nDespite all that, I actually kinda like where I live. It's affordable, convenient, and I'm close to the university and bus stops.",
            "My neighborhood's a real throwback. It's got these duplexes lined up on a cul-de-sac, spaced out so they look like individual houses.  They all share the same yellow paint, white porches, and green metal roofs, though.  Most of the folks here know each other pretty well. We hang out at the end of driveways, shooting the breeze while the kids play – sidewalk chalk, kites, the usual. It's a nice change of pace from the constant screens and hustle of modern life. Feels like stepping back in time, surrounded by fields, trees, and endless blue skies dotted with puffy clouds. The only bummer? We've been getting tornado warnings lately, and last night, those sirens actually went off! Ended up in the bathtub with my little dog, my purse, and some pillows – you know, the essentials. My big dog, though? He wasn't having it. Stuck in the living room, barking his head off, clearly spooked. You could hear the hail pounding on the ground, and after the storm, the street was practically steaming from the temperature swing. Went from 92 degrees to 75 in minutes – the hail melted instantly. Then, as the clouds cleared, the sun came out and started raining again. And wouldn't you know it, a double rainbow appeared! I grabbed my camera and snapped some pics to share with everyone. They were blown away, and so was I. The neighborhood was quiet for a while after the storm, then folks started trickling back home. Back to normal – kids playing, moms chatting, dinner cooking. This place has been a real blessing for me since I moved here from New Hampshire. Love the Southern drawl, gotta admit. \n\nEveryone's got a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, but they're not all the same inside.  Some are surprisingly tiny.  I love taking walks out to the big field behind my place and heading down to the pond (not for swimming, though).  I've spotted deer and in the mornings, you can hear this giant bullfrog croaking his heart out. It's a great place to live, just a hop, skip, and a jump from Charlotte.  Every morning starts with the sound of roosters crowing from the nearby farms. Feels like living in a little village, actually.  There's even a donkey at a farm down the road that brays every evening to let us know he's around. So glad I stumbled upon this little gem of a neighborhood.",
            "So, I moved into this neighborhood right when eighth grade started, and it took a bit to make friends. I ended up getting close to a couple of guys, one lives a couple houses down, and the other's on my street, but they've both moved on now.  Still, the memories stick around. Most of the folks who were here when I first got here are still around, which is cool.  The neighborhood's pretty typical – lots of two-story houses, you know, the standard suburban thing. On sunny days, you can always hear kids playing outside – it's a pretty chill place, mostly quiet during the week.  I've never had any issues with anyone here, folks are pretty much left to their own devices unless they need something. Never had a package stolen off my porch either, so I feel pretty safe.\n\nThere's this park just a hop, skip, and a jump from my place, and it's got a ton of memories attached to it.  Played tons of basketball, football, and baseball there with the neighborhood guys back in the day. Had a pretty brutal moment too, got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good times definitely outweigh the bad. Nowadays, I mostly go there with my cousin's kids – they're way younger and still into swings and slides and whatnot. Just seeing the park gets them super excited, which is kinda heartwarming. It definitely makes me nostalgic for that part of my life.\n\nThis neighborhood's got a good mix of people from all walks of life. You can find all sorts of food places within a mile – Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian, the works.  These days, everyone's using apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered, though. Fast food is pretty popular here, like pretty much anywhere, and there are tons of pizza places too.  \n\nThere are plenty of stores around here for everything you could need – dry cleaners, Walgreens, CVS, even a Jewel-Osco, which is a big deal in the Midwest. You can even find a store owned by some folks from India, perfect for getting some homemade or ready-made Indian food if you're feeling adventurous.\n\nOverall, I'm pretty happy with my neighborhood. Hearing all the crazy stories about bad neighbors on social media and the news, I feel really lucky to have the ones I do.",
            "My town, Johnston, is like a lot of other small towns in South Carolina. It's pretty unassuming, but it's known for one big thing: peaches!  Everyone here takes pride in the fact that Johnston is the \"Peach Capital of the World,\" and you'll see that slogan plastered all over town. It's mostly just farmland, either peach orchards or cattle grazing.  \n\nThe houses are spread out, most are two stories with metal roofs to beat the heat or gray shingles. They're usually set back from the road, leaving space in front for animals or crops.  The main part of town is where you'll find the only stoplight, which controls traffic at a four-way intersection.  That's also where all the stores are.\n\nFor \"fast food,\" you've got Hong Kong (a tiny Chinese place run by a family), Fiesta Mexican, or Gary's, a small burger chain. We used to have a pizza place, but it closed not too long ago. There's a small, family-owned pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, known for their Cherry Coca-Cola.  Then there's IGA, the only grocery store in town, which is a bit pricey. People often drive to Batesburg-Leesville to Walmart for their main grocery shopping.  But, the most popular store is probably Dollar General. It's always busy because it's got everything you need!\n\nThere's also a furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a lovely lady who's a fixture in the community. It's been around forever and even has movers to deliver your purchases! Attached to the furniture store is a pet groomer, Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They offer daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, baths, you name it. The doctor's office and the vet are both small but well-equipped, located away from the main town area.  We have one elementary school, Johnston Elementary, but after fifth grade, kids have to go to the next town for middle and high school.\n\nWe don't really have any parks, although they're trying to build a small recreation area. There aren't any movie theaters, bowling alleys, or places to just hang out. It's pretty quiet here.\n\nBut, despite all that, it's a nice town. It's so small you could easily drive through it without even realizing you were in a town at all!",
            "My first encounter with this place was through a podcast about missing persons, which was a bit of a shock.  Rent for apartments around here skyrockets past a thousand bucks a month, and I'd never heard a peep about any disappearances, neither had my buddies. Maybe it's the cost of living getting to folks. I know a few friends who end up crying themselves to sleep over money worries. Things are pricey, but we've learned to be resourceful over time. You start to get used to the musty scent of flea market toys and clothes that have been mothballed for years. You smell less as an adult, you might pick up smoking, or maybe you just get used to the state of things. But the flea market feeling always sneaks back. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines piled on a closed piano. It gets stuck in the leather and lingers even after washing.  \n\nThere are at least three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start at one end, you can hit up two charity shops, a library, a rare book store, and a place full of oddities.  Downtown's a bustling hive of cars and people every morning, but inside those thrift stores, it's silent. No matter how many people or cars zip by, the silence holds. It's a perfect spot to lose track of an afternoon. Every year, more and more of those places pop up. Cars and people flood the streets. It's a growing city, they say. Hosting one of the biggest online empires for shopping and delivery, it's still going through growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone's focused on their own goals, and nobody expects much from anyone else. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you be. It's not like the South, where a little concern means you really care. People here don't pry into each other's lives. You can keep your walls up as long as you want, and the city just rolls along like waves on the beach. It's a vibrant place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur singers upstairs, there's always something happening. In a way, we're less like an apartment building full of strangers and more like a community of friends. We come together for birthdays, funerals, and to help each other out when needed.  \n\nI'm lucky to be here, honestly. I like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I try to keep things tidy, leave them snacks, and they do the same for me. We trade mail, and it's nice to see each other. I think they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, impersonal modern complex, but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't completely mess things up.",
            "My neighborhood is like, the definition of cookie-cutter suburbia. You know, the kind where the homeowner's association is basically running the show.  Step inside, and it's a parade of identical single-family homes, all perfectly manicured lawns, matching driveways, and those little patches of pebbles everyone loves.  Oh, and don't forget the two-car garages, standard issue for every house.   You'll be cruising down these freshly paved roads, and it's like, zero potholes in sight.  Most houses are single-story, but sometimes you'll bump into a two-story one.  Mailboxes are a little different here too. No individual boxes out front, instead, it's more like an apartment building deal – a big cluster of mailboxes at the end of the street, everyone using a key to grab their own. And there are these giant lockers for packages, just in case those aren't small enough.  Thanks, HOA, for keeping things, well, *uniform*.\n\nLiving on the outskirts of the city, my neighborhood's kind of a mix of suburbia and rural.  We've got a ton of space.\n\nMultiple community pools, all gated and sparkling clean.  And these walking trails that snake through the neighborhood, perfect for your daily dog walk or a quiet evening stroll. No need to find a park, you can just run laps around the whole place.  Most people here are retired folks, super friendly and always looking out for each other.  You've got your share of middle-aged and young professionals mixed in too.  \n\nThe city itself is surprisingly big, but it's got that small-town vibe.  We've got the essentials, like one mall (not huge, but it gets the job done).  About a 15-minute drive gets you to all the big box stores you could ever want, from fancy organic grocery stores to those bargain outlets with barely any staff. \n\nAll in all, my neighborhood's pretty typical, safe, well-kept, and boring.  Nice things, like pools and trails, but not exactly a party scene.  You want something, hop in the car and it’s a quick trip to whatever chain store you need.",
            "I call this small Midwestern town home, just outside a big city's suburbs. My neighborhood, on the east side, is the least wealthy part of town. Houses are mostly rented or owned by folks who aren't rolling in dough. But it's not a bad place to live. My neighbors are mostly friendly folks who wave and say hello when I'm out and about. Sure, crime rates are a tad higher than in other parts of town, but they're not out of control. There have been a few violent incidents nearby over the past decade, including some shootings and even a homicide. Our next-door neighbors lost their son last year in a shooting outside a local bar, which was heartbreaking. Luckily, our family has stayed safe, though we've had the occasional porch pirate make off with something if we're not careful.\n\nThe \"opioid epidemic\" has hit our town pretty hard, like a lot of places in the US. It's stolen too many lives due to fentanyl overdoses. Thankfully, there are resources here, like rehab centers and Narcan training for families and friends dealing with addiction. \n\nDespite these struggles, there's a lot to love about our town. My son's elementary school has a fantastic staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. He's thrived there, even with his special needs, because the school has such a positive atmosphere, and he hasn't faced any bullying. We have a super active Parent Teacher Organization that throws events all year to get families involved and boost learning.  Since over 20% of our town lives below the poverty line, the school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so no kid goes hungry. They make sure no one feels less than because they can't afford things, and school fees, supplies, and field trips are really reasonable.\n\nThe City Council has put effort into sprucing up town, repaving roads, landscaping, and fixing up parks. Most of these improvements are downtown and on the west side, where the shops and traffic are. The east side, where I live, tends to get overlooked, which a lot of people in our neighborhood find frustrating.\n\nOverall, I'm happy living here. People are friendly, the schools are great, we've got enough shopping options (both small businesses and big chains) to get what we need, and our house might not be worth much, but it's comfortable and fits our family. We've been here for over 16 years, and can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is bursting with character. It's perched on a hill, surrounded by buildings with stories to tell. I live in a seven-story apartment building right across from the old live theater, and just down the street is this awesome little arcade bar that draws all sorts of people on warm summer nights. You'll often see a line snaking down the block, especially on weekends during June and July. A few blocks up is the nearest city park, surprisingly spacious for the area. It's surrounded by concrete with steep stairs built right into the wall. During the harsh winter months, homeless people set up tidy rows of tents along the sidewalk and those wide stairs. It doesn't snow much, but the rainstorms in mid-winter can be brutal, making it tough to stay warm.  Clustering their tents together in the heart of town instead of out in the open keeps them warmer and they're within walking distance of the only family center for miles, where they can shower and clean up. What I truly love about my city, though, isn't the beauty of its history – the towering buildings, the architecture that climbs the hills rolling down to the ocean. It's the people that make my neighborhood special.  Hilltop used to be the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. Even three decades later, you still hear stories about the feds and the DEA cracking down, trying to clean up the streets. The people remember. Those stories are passed down through generations, even to newcomers like me. They work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher areas in the city, to keep it clean and safe. They care about their city, their block. People say if you're white, you shouldn't walk around Hilltop after dark. I think it's a relic of the old days, tinged with the bitterness of social conditioning. Maybe because I'm dark enough to pass for something other than a \"white girl,\" or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of their own, someone who understands the constant reminders of racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions that stem from ignorance and fear, even in a city that's supposed to be a melting pot of cultures. One thing's for sure: no matter where I go, Hilltop will always feel like home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more often offered me a jacket than tried to rob me. It's a place where the laundromat owner stayed open late so I could charge my phone when I was caught in the rain. It's a place where, huddled against a concrete storefront on a bleak night, I felt invisible, only to have someone stop, look me in the eye, hand me five dollars, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I call home a little slice of Rural America, specifically a small town in Michigan. You'll find fields of crops transitioning into quaint tourist spots, but forget big city amenities like malls, Wal-Mart, Target, or even an Applebee's.  Getting around means hopping in the car because everything's a drive.  Even with that,  I think I live in one of the most beautiful places on Earth, surrounded by water. My town sits snuggled between Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix –  think beaches just steps away no matter where you are. \n\nMy neighborhood screams \"small town USA.\" Houses aren't crammed together, and they're not those cookie-cutter creations. They're older homes, some spruced up and modernized, others keeping their vintage charm. Most have full basements you can easily spot from the street.  You'll see a mix of aluminum siding, with houses painted in every color imaginable lining the streets. Most have yards, complete with trampolines, playsets, gardens, and fences for the family pets. They paint a picture of hard-working folks, raising families or enjoying the fruits of their labor. \n\nKids zoom up and down the sidewalks, you'll spot people walking dogs, biking, or rollerblading.  There's a real sense of community here; neighbors know each other, and you can quickly tell who belongs and who's just passing through.  You'll see someone grilling out and get a friendly wave, or a passerby walking their dog will offer a warm smile. Lawns are well-kept; no piles of leaves, just neat, mowed grass and trimmed bushes. It's not about flashy mansions, but about a place that feels like home. It's quiet, peaceful, and safe – a place you'd want to raise a family. \n\nThe county sheriff's department and jail are within walking distance, followed by the health department. The city's recycling center is just down the road, serving residents from all corners. Nearby, you'll find baseball and softball fields, where you can hear the excitement of the announcers and the cheers of the crowd. Our small town airport sits right next to it, so you'll hear the rumble of small planes taking off and landing, whether you're inside or outside.  A quick stroll takes you to the local ice cream shop, and if you're feeling ambitious, you can bike or walk into downtown.\n\nMy kids can ride their bikes to the park, just eight blocks away. It's a truly great place to live."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "My neighborhood in this big city is a real melting pot, with residential areas scattered randomly amongst shops and businesses. You've got your typical office buildings, but also all kinds of stores, restaurants, and entertainment spots.  There's always something new to try, whether it's a fancy chain store or a cool little boutique popping up on every corner. These boutiques aren't just found in malls, they've taken over the streets, adding some buzz to quieter neighborhoods.  \n\nAnd speaking of buzz, there are a couple of parks nearby that are always packed with families. As for the people, my neighborhood is a crazy mix. We've got a strong LGBTQ+ presence, a big Orthodox Jewish community, and a bunch of immigrants from the former Soviet Union all living together.\n\nVenture a little further out, and you'll find even more diverse pockets, like Korea Town, China Town, Little Armenia, and so on.  They're all just a short drive away, but \"short\" can be a relative term in this city. Ten miles can easily turn into a two-hour nightmare thanks to rush hour traffic. \n\nIt's a car-centric place, so most people don't walk around much. Since everything is spread out, even places that seem close can be a pain to get to on foot.  This leads to some of the worst traffic in the world and a never-ending search for parking. Ironically, they're building tons of new apartments, which is great for attracting more people, but not so great for those of us who are already here and struggling with the traffic and parking.\n\nBut hey, at least there's variety in housing. You've got your massive apartment buildings, but also tons of houses, duplexes, smaller apartment complexes, and everything in between.  It's a mixed bag in terms of people too.  I don't really know most of my neighbors, it's not exactly a close-knit community anymore. Back in the day, though, we used to play outside all the time with the kids from the neighborhood. Those were the days.",
            "My neighborhood is a fascinating blend of old and new. Most of the homes are traditional single-family houses, though a few have been divided into two separate units while still sharing a wall. My own place has a small front yard and a tiny driveway. It's the kind of house that whispers of a bygone era when suburban living was the quintessential American dream.  A dream that once felt inclusive, but now seems to be slipping away. Yet, my neighborhood, along with countless others like it, still holds out hope, still calls to us, reminding us that the dream endures. \n\nWhile the optimism might not be as bright as it once was, and the yards aren't always perfectly manicured, there are still cars in every driveway, and kids playing as if they own the world. The old public school, a landmark for nearly 90 years, stands tall, offering a glimpse of the future to today's youth while stirring up memories for the older generation. \n\nChurches are scarce, mostly empty now, but the basketball courts are always buzzing with activity. Every house looks different, yet they share a common feeling, a sense of shared history. There's a large supermarket, \"Super A,\" run by a large Yemeni family, likely the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The majority of residents are African American, with families who have lived here for generations, their stories weaving a tapestry of a time when everyone knew everyone else. \n\nThere used to be a karate school, but when Hollywood moved on from \"The Karate Kid,\" the kids lost interest, and it's now a pharmacy – because, as they say, drugs solve everything. There's also a small movie theater showing classic films at discounted prices. It's a haven for the older generation, who appreciate a night out without the distractions of today's blockbusters, while the youth look down upon its lack of new releases.\n\nA single expressway cuts through our town, technically entering and exiting in the neighboring town. We once tried to get our own exit, but the youth supported it, while the elders opposed it, arguing that it would ruin our town's charm. They eventually convinced the city council to deny our request. Now, a new high school is being built, and we're debating a mascot.

            "You might overlook it at first glance. It's tucked behind a shopping strip in a residential area, not exactly a place you'd expect to find vibrant living spaces. Not the kind of place most people would choose to live. But if you venture past the old, deserted Whole Foods and behind the hotels that mostly stand empty except for occasional family reunions in the summer, you'll stumble upon a thriving community.  \n\nDown these hidden streets, nestled together like disassembled Russian nesting dolls, are a few apartment complexes. The first ones you encounter have a somewhat shady reputation, so let's not dwell on them. Appearances can be deceiving, right? But the complexes next to those, and the ones after that, are worlds apart, unknown to most people in the area.  \n\nAcross from these apartments sits a quiet satellite campus of a community college. Sleepy students shuffle in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to start their day. The iron gates creak open to let them in one by one, while commuters give them the stink eye and grumble about the traffic delays on busier mornings. The road then intersects with another residential street, where a park sits on one side and a rehabilitation center for people recovering from injuries stands on the other. The center boasts cheerful porch furniture and a lazy ceiling fan that stirs up the thick summer air. \n\nKids zoom around the park across the street, cartwheeling and playing tag. Bees buzz lazily around the flowerbeds by the road. Older folks walk their dogs along the path, giving teenagers on skateboards a disapproving look and politely nodding at young girls gathered by the playground, gossiping about boys and the latest trends. There's a sushi spot in a nearby strip mall with affordable food but not always a packed crowd. Next to it, a swimming supply store, and a nail salon tucked between them. You could fill your pool for the season, get a manicure, and enjoy some hibachi chicken, all in one stop - the magic of a strip mall. And don't forget the frozen yogurt place, the DIY kind, where you often see teenagers from the park clutching cold cups covered in toppings while they show off their skateboarding skills and vape, convinced it makes them cool. \n\nThis neighborhood is a slice of classic Americana - a piece of history in sleepy southern town where time seems to stand still.",
            "She asked, \"Where is everything?\" as we drove past endless cornfields stretching as far as the eye could see.  I knew she'd be stunned by the vast emptiness of the landscape. She grew up in a town where the grocery store was just a stone's throw away, so this much open space was completely foreign to her. Overwhelmed by the sea of corn, I told her about growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood where I came from. \n\nAs we continued down the two-lane road, you'd reach a quarry filled with water. Just past it lies the small development I call home. Mostly brick and stucco houses, each with at least half an acre of land, take pride of place.  Springtime explodes with color from the flowers planted each year, alongside the ever-changing hues of the Midwestern trees. Gleaming Mercedes Benzes, the epitome of luxury, fill the driveways, sparkling in the midday sun after a good wash.\n\nNear my grey stucco house, my Korean neighbor always greets me with a warm smile. He spends his days meticulously tending to his lawn, his laughter often accompanying the hum of his lawnmower. Everyone finds his dedication amusing, but he's a genuinely kind soul with a fascinating past.  He's a bit older now, his wit slightly dimmed by time. Once a doctor, he blends seamlessly with the grass and his John Deere Zero Turn mower.\n\nFinally, we reach my house. Geese roam the side yard, chased by our energetic Terrier. Out back, a small stream flows into the quarry, where bullfrogs croak, the water murmurs, and the occasional \"moo\" from nearby farms reaches our ears.  A handmade wooden bridge leads to a secluded oasis untouched by human hands.  Here, trees, herbs, and wildflowers grow wild and free. This was my childhood playground. From building tree forts to 'hunting' (mostly chasing) animals, there was always something to do, and a neighborhood friend was always around.\n\nWinters in our small town are harsh but breathtaking.  The green yard transforms into a desolate wilderness. Trees, once adorned with vibrant flowers, stand bare, skeletal against the sky. When snow falls, it blankets everything in a magical white layer. Snow angels and snowmen line the backyard, remnants of my sister and I's childhood battles. We fought constantly, and during winter, snowballs were our weapons of choice. We built massive, igloo-like forts to store our arsenal of branches, creating our own winter wonderland. In that world, pretending was everything, and we were just carefree kids.",
            "You gotta get Portland, Oregon. \"Keep Portland Weird,\" it says on a building that's basically a pizza place, bar, music venue, and, well, let's just say it pushes the boundaries a little. Some folks see it as a throwback to the '90s and early 2000s, a time before Portland got famous and pricey, when all sorts of unique subcultures thrived. For others, it's a call to adventure – come to Portland, where \"weird\" isn't a bad thing, it's a badge of honor. Even with all the fancy Californians moving in and the constant construction of condos, Portland still holds onto its weirdness.\n\nNow, \"weird\" doesn't mean everyone's always accepting, but it does mean embracing things that aren't exactly mainstream. It doesn't mean we're immune to modern life – we've got the same Chinese imports as everywhere else. There are a million ways to be \"not normal,\" and Portland has plenty of that. We've got yoga studios, hipsters, business types...maybe \"weird\" is just us taking it all a little less seriously.\n\nTake my neighborhood, for example. We've got colorful houses, gardens bursting with flowers and veggies, and these free boxes piled up in the summer. They're usually just cardboard boxes filled with stuff people are getting rid of, but sometimes it's plastic bags or whatever. It's like a treasure hunt – you never know what you'll find, clothes, books, maybe even something truly bizarre. That's the magic of wandering through Southeast Portland – you're bound to stumble upon something unexpected.\n\nThat's what Portland is all about, at least to me. But I'm just one small piece of the weird puzzle. Some folks wouldn't dream of picking clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. They're off doing goat yoga (yes, with real goats!) or cheering on the Timbers (our beloved soccer team). Portland is full of people chasing dreams, big or small, and probably a few too many folks spending their evenings at the bar.\n\nYeah, we've got drug problems. I mean, most places do, and it often boils down to mental health struggles. And the constant rain and gray skies probably don't help. We also have a homelessness problem, which no one seems to have a good solution for. People come here for the social services, which are better than in most places, but they're still not enough. The non-homeless folks are caught between wanting to help and feeling overwhelmed.\n\nSo, yeah, we're not perfect. We're weird, sure, but we're also human, struggling with the same issues as everyone else. But maybe that's part of the weird magic of Portland – embracing the messy, complicated, and ultimately beautiful reality of it all.",
            "The mountains, they're always there, you know?  North of everything, watching the sun rise and set every single day. I can get so caught up in work and life, forget about them entirely. But they're still there, solid, dependable, unbothered by any of my drama. On the days when stress just piles on, I find myself drawn to them. They're like a calming force, giving me a little boost to keep going, one step at a time.  \n\nI remember when I first moved here for college,  it was the mountains just north of campus that really hooked me. The university itself is stunning, with its buildings, ponds, and trees, all holding a special place in my heart. But the mountains? They're the real MVPs. \n\nThe town itself is pretty cool too.  It's got these awesome cafes - perfect for late-night study sessions fueled by caffeine. You can hop on a bus or take a quick walk to downtown, and suddenly you're surrounded by this old-school vibe, with faded brick buildings lining the streets. It's like a mini-city with its own energy, buzzing with life.  But just a few blocks later, you're back in that serene small-town atmosphere, passing by the library and all. It's this weird mix of vibes that makes this place so fascinating. \n\nIt's easy to make memories here, good and bad.  Walking past those rusty swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter, or racing through downtown to catch a movie at that fancy theater the university scored tickets for. But there are tough memories too, like those late-night existential crises by the ponds.  I've definitely had my share of those.\n\nWatching the turtles and ducks and bugs going about their lives, I'd get lost thinking about my own purpose, struggling to figure out this whole life thing. So, I'd walk past the pond, the park, those little houses that scream \"suburbia,\" until I hit the main street.  That's when the sun would hit the palm trees, painting the sky with its golden light, and I'd realize I was walking north.\n\nAnd there they were, the mountains, just as they always had been. Towering over everything else, they'd meet the blue and yellow sky, and somehow, just by being there, they'd reawaken this sense of hope inside me.",
            "Alright, so you're thinking about checking out Bensonhurst, huh? Don't sweat finding it, public transit's a breeze in this city. You'll definitely feel like you're in the heart of NYC, it's a proper urban vibe. \n\nGet ready for a serious dose of Asian culture, it's taken over the place in the last twenty years or so. Seriously, you won't walk a block without bumping into an Asian-owned store – supermarkets, laundromats, the whole shebang. And they're super popular, not just with the Asian community, but everyone. The food's top-notch, prices are killer, and it's just so damn convenient. I'm talking four Asian supermarkets within spitting distance of each other!  \n\nBut don't get the wrong idea, it's not just an Asian enclave. It's a melting pot, with immigrants and their families making it their home. You'll see a mix of everything, and the big businesses? Mostly Asian-owned.\n\nPlus, there's this super cool renovated park nearby with, like, ten basketball courts, a massive field for soccer or baseball, handball courts, swings, a kid's playground – the works. And a water fountain for those scorching summer days. It's a real community hub, you'll see all kinds of people chilling and having a good time.\n\nForget about towering corporate buildings, though. It's mostly co-ops, condos, and two-family houses. \n\nThe people are mostly friendly, but let me tell you, they're LOUD. Cars blaring music, revving engines – it's a symphony of city noise. Be prepared to wake up with a jolt some mornings!\n\nNow, Bensonhurst is generally safe, but you gotta be street smart, especially at night. There are always those unpredictable characters who might cause trouble for no reason.  I've been in a couple of sticky situations here myself, some years back. Package theft is also a thing, nothing new in the city, I guess.\n\nAnd one last thing – dog poop.  Ugh, it's everywhere! People don't seem to care about cleaning up after their pets. Be careful where you step, or you'll be dodging landmines all day long.",
            "Life up here on the hill is a bit... different.  There aren't any sidewalks, so everyone walks in the road, which is pockmarked and pretty rough in spots.  The power lines look like a patchwork quilt after all the storms and the falling branches.  You'd think they'd just take the old, tired trees down, but nope, people love to complain about them blocking the view of the ocean.  That's why so many houses are built high up, with these giant second-story windows trying to catch a glimpse of the water.  It's pretty spectacular at sunset when the bay glows and the sky turns orange, but most days it's cloudy and overcast, so the sunlight just kind of filters through.  You can see moss growing everywhere—roofs, cars, even railings.  I once had to spend three hours scraping moss off my car after leaving it parked for a month.\n\nThe neighborhood is mostly older folks, retired types.  Dogs are more common than kids, and they're always running around, barking, or snooping around for treats.  I had a dog sneak into my living room once!\n\nRabbits are another story.  They're everywhere, digging up gardens and lawns, but my cats love to chase them.  We've got the usual birds too—sparrows, hummingbirds, the occasional hawk or eagle that gets chased away by the neighborhood crows.\n\nThere aren't any shops around here, just a few seafood restaurants down by the waterfront if you're willing to hike down the hill.  The beach isn't much to write home about, but we like to chuck rocks into the bay.  It's not very wide, so you can see the other side even through the fog.",
            "I live on a typical suburban street in a small Southern town, Tennessee. It's right between two state highways, so we get more traffic than I'd prefer, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood.  People move in and out pretty rarely, so I've gotten to know most of the folks around here.  They keep themselves busy with yard work and daily chores, mostly. In the winter, we all sled down the hill on our side street. Our house sits on the corner, so we see everyone coming and going all day. We even know which cars belong to which neighbors. Whenever we spot something unusual, it catches our eye. \n\nSome neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids are out on their bikes, doing all the usual kid things. We're home a lot since we both work from home. It's just the four of us: me, my wife, and our two daughters, who are eleven and fourteen. So, everyone else is used to seeing us around too. We get outside and play, even in the rain sometimes. We fire up the grill on the back deck every now and then, and the smell of barbecue always fills the air.\n\nThere's always someone cutting grass – you can practically hear a lawnmower every day from March until about October, when the grass finally slows down. We have a ton of trees because the neighborhood used to be wooded, so there's plenty of shade, but come fall, we're raking and burning leaves constantly. I actually love the smell of burning leaves, so it's a good sign that fall is here. Lately, we haven't had much of a winter at all, so it's felt like a never-ending fall. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone's at the door, which doesn't happen often. I like to work on my truck and other projects in the garage, and when the garage doors are open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood.\n\nThings are pretty quiet around here on holidays. Thanksgiving brings some extended family, and there are cars parked everywhere. It's the same for Mother's Day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here.  If it weren't for the traffic, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is smack dab in the middle of the high desert, where it's all dirt, dirt, and more dirt. Unless you've actually lived here, you probably can't truly grasp the feeling of constantly seeing brown. And when you do spot a lawn, you know that person is shelling out a small fortune to keep it that way. Back in the 90s when I first moved here, houses were spread out like stars in the night sky. Now, it's still pretty spread out, but there are a ton of new houses popping up. Honestly, it's starting to look more like a city every day, but I guess that's the story everywhere these days. Most of the people here are super friendly, but like any place, you've got your good and bad parts. My neighborhood is surrounded by friendly old folks, so I guess that makes it a pretty decent place to live. \n\nAs for shopping, you're mostly stuck with chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart and Final. For anything upscale, you'd have to drive a good distance – no Whole Foods or anything like that around here.\n\nLooking at the job scene, it seems like construction is king. I'm guessing this is because the city's still pretty undeveloped, with tons of open space just begging to be built on. It kinda scares me, though. I like things the way they are now. I escaped the big city, and I'm not looking to go back anytime soon. Speaking of construction, that's actually where I work full-time. I'm a drywall and T-bar installer.\n\nWhat I love most about living here is the wildlife. People come to the high desert for all sorts of reasons, but the raw beauty of the desert itself is a big draw. The unique climate and landscape create challenging ecosystems that need protection and are home to all sorts of fascinating creatures. We, as human residents, should make an effort to learn about these non-human neighbors so we can co-exist peacefully. My family and I have definitely adapted to living with wildlife. My three kids are obsessed with lizards and desert bugs – right now, they're outside trying to catch some specimens!\n\nAs for attractions, we've got a few. Victorville is a great place for families looking for a unique desert experience. If you're visiting, try to time your trip with the annual San Bernardino County Fair. It's a blast with the perfect mix of activities and fun, Victorville style! \n\nFor something different, head over to nearby Wrightwood to see the snow-capped mountains and take some winter sports lessons. \n\nIf you're interested in the history and culture of this high desert ecosystem, check out the Victor Valley Museum. It's got geological and paleontological exhibits, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of Victorville's development.",
            "Okay, so when people ask me about my neighborhood, it's kinda different from what they're used to. Most folks probably picture houses and lawns, right?  Not me. My neighborhood is the college campus I live on. My dorm is my home base, and all the other students, they're my crew.  The whole campus, well, that's my neighborhood too, just on a bigger scale.  \n\nBut even though it's not your typical neighborhood, it's got the same stuff: houses, people, shops, and even a park. Let's talk about the \"houses\" first.  We've got apartments, regular houses, and dorm buildings.  Apartments are where you'll find groups of 2-4 people per room, usually 4-6 rooms per floor. A typical building has two floors, so maybe 20 people total. Then there are actual houses, like singles or doubles, mostly for alumni. But those are pretty rare around here.  And lastly, there are the dorms, packed with hundreds of students, two per room mostly.  Dorms are the most common place to live on campus.\n\nNow, about the people. My school's all about diversity, so my neighborhood is a melting pot.  You got folks from all walks of life, all ages.  The staff usually lives in those houses, newer students are in the dorms, and the older ones tend to go for apartments.  There's so much to say about the people here, but I'll save it for another time.\n\nOn campus, we're pretty self-sufficient.  We've got a ton of stores, everything from cafes to bookstores to the school's own brand of clothing and groceries.  It's like our own little world!  And don't forget the park. It's a safe space for everyone, kept clean and friendly by everyone who calls this place home.",
            "So, I've been living here for about 10 years now, and figured I'd share some of my experiences.  Moving from Riverdale to Stockbridge was rough at first.  I was pretty bummed,  I really missed my old neighborhood and friends, you know? But my parents wanted a better life for me and my little sister, so we moved for better schools, housing, and everything they thought was \"not ghetto.\"   It took a while to adjust, met some new people (both friends and frenemies at school), but I never really got to know my neighbors much, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis for a while since they lived right next door. They've been awesome, almost like family, and I'm really grateful for them.  I remember going to Mr. Glen's wedding with my parents and sister - it was a blast!  It made me think about my future and wanting to give my future wife the same kind of happiness.   There was this funny moment when Mr. Glen's wife, Ms. Veda, took off this little white strap on her leg and threw it, and I actually caught it! Sadly, I missed the bouquet though. We danced the night away, and I had a great time hanging out with Marsharii, one of their daughters. Haven't seen her since, but hope she's doing well. \n\nThis neighborhood is like a maze, but now with GPS, I'm ready to explore more. So far, I've mostly hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We were all about video games back in the day, just living it up. Sometimes I'd go to the park, which is super peaceful and calming. I even practice my balance with some sticks I got from Home Depot and sometimes bring my bokken wooden sword. It's fun doing the things I love.  There's also a basketball and tennis court, even though I haven't played in ages. It's cool to have them there just in case. My dad got me and my best friend into tennis with Mr. Graves, and we had a blast. They really pushed us, but it was always fun.  Looking back, I've had so many great times in this neighborhood, there are tons of stories! But these are the ones that really stick with me.  I know the best is yet to come!",
            "My digs are super close to my college, which is a major perk.  It's mostly apartments around here, with a sprinkle of decent, affordable restaurants and bars.  One bar just got a fancy name change and jacked up the prices, but the drinks aren't *that* bad. Most folks are chill, either students or on a budget since the rent's not astronomical. There are tons of kids around because there's an elementary school practically next door. I'm not exactly BFFs with my neighbors, though. They're the heavy weed-smoking type, so the building management put an air freshener unit right outside their door – talk about awkward! It's kinda insulting, to be honest.\n\nThe buildings around me are old-school, though they might have had a recent makeover inside. Down the street, there are these brand new apartments, but I can't stand them. They're poorly built, overpriced, and the management gets away with it because they're close to campus. It's a total scam! There's this cheap eats joint a few blocks away where everything comes on paper plates and most of it's microwaved.  Right next door is a gas station, which supposedly isn't a great place to work.  \n\nBut, they redid the road last summer thanks to some city cash, so now there's a nice sidewalk, tons of grass, and the whole area looks a bit nicer. My building itself is kind of hidden away by trees – they cut down a few, but there are still plenty left. Behind the complex is a line of trees, then another set of apartments. I'm on 42nd Street, but right behind me is 43rd, which is a bit rougher. The sidewalks are crumbling, the buildings look shabby, and there are tons of trees, probably to hide the eyesores! Most of the trouble in the area seems to be coming from an apartment complex on 43rd, but to be fair, the apartments across the street from me aren't exactly angels either – a lot of crime and a revolving door of tenants.\n\nDespite all that, I actually kinda like where I live. It's affordable, convenient, and I'm close to the university and bus stops.",
            "My neighborhood's a real throwback. It's got these duplexes lined up on a cul-de-sac, spaced out so they look like individual houses.  They all share the same yellow paint, white porches, and green metal roofs, though.  Most of the folks here know each other pretty well. We hang out at the end of driveways, shooting the breeze while the kids play – sidewalk chalk, kites, the usual. It's a nice change of pace from the constant screens and hustle of modern life. Feels like stepping back in time, surrounded by fields, trees, and endless blue skies dotted with puffy clouds. The only bummer? We've been getting tornado warnings lately, and last night, those sirens actually went off! Ended up in the bathtub with my little dog, my purse, and some pillows – you know, the essentials. My big dog, though? He wasn't having it. Stuck in the living room, barking his head off, clearly spooked. You could hear the hail pounding on the ground, and after the storm, the street was practically steaming from the temperature swing. Went from 92 degrees to 75 in minutes – the hail melted instantly. Then, as the clouds cleared, the sun came out and started raining again. And wouldn't you know it, a double rainbow appeared! I grabbed my camera and snapped some pics to share with everyone. They were blown away, and so was I. The neighborhood was quiet for a while after the storm, then folks started trickling back home. Back to normal – kids playing, moms chatting, dinner cooking. This place has been a real blessing for me since I moved here from New Hampshire. Love the Southern drawl, gotta admit. \n\nEveryone's got a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, but they're not all the same inside.  Some are surprisingly tiny.  I love taking walks out to the big field behind my place and heading down to the pond (not for swimming, though).  I've spotted deer and in the mornings, you can hear this giant bullfrog croaking his heart out. It's a great place to live, just a hop, skip, and a jump from Charlotte.  Every morning starts with the sound of roosters crowing from the nearby farms. Feels like living in a little village, actually.  There's even a donkey at a farm down the road that brays every evening to let us know he's around. So glad I stumbled upon this little gem of a neighborhood.",
            "So, I moved into this neighborhood right when eighth grade started, and it took a bit to make friends. I ended up getting close to a couple of guys, one lives a couple houses down, and the other's on my street, but they've both moved on now.  Still, the memories stick around. Most of the folks who were here when I first got here are still around, which is cool.  The neighborhood's pretty typical – lots of two-story houses, you know, the standard suburban thing. On sunny days, you can always hear kids playing outside – it's a pretty chill place, mostly quiet during the week.  I've never had any issues with anyone here, folks are pretty much left to their own devices unless they need something. Never had a package stolen off my porch either, so I feel pretty safe.\n\nThere's this park just a hop, skip, and a jump from my place, and it's got a ton of memories attached to it.  Played tons of basketball, football, and baseball there with the neighborhood guys back in the day. Had a pretty brutal moment too, got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good times definitely outweigh the bad. Nowadays, I mostly go there with my cousin's kids – they're way younger and still into swings and slides and whatnot. Just seeing the park gets them super excited, which is kinda heartwarming. It definitely makes me nostalgic for that part of my life.\n\nThis neighborhood's got a good mix of people from all walks of life. You can find all sorts of food places within a mile – Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian, the works.  These days, everyone's using apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered, though. Fast food is pretty popular here, like pretty much anywhere, and there are tons of pizza places too.  \n\nThere are plenty of stores around here for everything you could need – dry cleaners, Walgreens, CVS, even a Jewel-Osco, which is a big deal in the Midwest. You can even find a store owned by some folks from India, perfect for getting some homemade or ready-made Indian food if you're feeling adventurous.\n\nOverall, I'm pretty happy with my neighborhood. Hearing all the crazy stories about bad neighbors on social media and the news, I feel really lucky to have the ones I do.",
            "My town, Johnston, is like a lot of other small towns in South Carolina. It's pretty unassuming, but it's known for one big thing: peaches!  Everyone here takes pride in the fact that Johnston is the \"Peach Capital of the World,\" and you'll see that slogan plastered all over town. It's mostly just farmland, either peach orchards or cattle grazing.  \n\nThe houses are spread out, most are two stories with metal roofs to beat the heat or gray shingles. They're usually set back from the road, leaving space in front for animals or crops.  The main part of town is where you'll find the only stoplight, which controls traffic at a four-way intersection.  That's also where all the stores are.\n\nFor \"fast food,\" you've got Hong Kong (a tiny Chinese place run by a family), Fiesta Mexican, or Gary's, a small burger chain. We used to have a pizza place, but it closed not too long ago. There's a small, family-owned pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, known for their Cherry Coca-Cola.  Then there's IGA, the only grocery store in town, which is a bit pricey. People often drive to Batesburg-Leesville to Walmart for their main grocery shopping.  But, the most popular store is probably Dollar General. It's always busy because it's got everything you need!\n\nThere's also a furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a lovely lady who's a fixture in the community. It's been around forever and even has movers to deliver your purchases! Attached to the furniture store is a pet groomer, Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They offer daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, baths, you name it. The doctor's office and the vet are both small but well-equipped, located away from the main town area.  We have one elementary school, Johnston Elementary, but after fifth grade, kids have to go to the next town for middle and high school.\n\nWe don't really have any parks, although they're trying to build a small recreation area. There aren't any movie theaters, bowling alleys, or places to just hang out. It's pretty quiet here.\n\nBut, despite all that, it's a nice town. It's so small you could easily drive through it without even realizing you were in a town at all!",
            "My first encounter with this place was through a podcast about missing persons, which was a bit of a shock.  Rent for apartments around here skyrockets past a thousand bucks a month, and I'd never heard a peep about any disappearances, neither had my buddies. Maybe it's the cost of living getting to folks. I know a few friends who end up crying themselves to sleep over money worries. Things are pricey, but we've learned to be resourceful over time. You start to get used to the musty scent of flea market toys and clothes that have been mothballed for years. You smell less as an adult, you might pick up smoking, or maybe you just get used to the state of things. But the flea market feeling always sneaks back. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines piled on a closed piano. It gets stuck in the leather and lingers even after washing.  \n\nThere are at least three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start at one end, you can hit up two charity shops, a library, a rare book store, and a place full of oddities.  Downtown's a bustling hive of cars and people every morning, but inside those thrift stores, it's silent. No matter how many people or cars zip by, the silence holds. It's a perfect spot to lose track of an afternoon. Every year, more and more of those places pop up. Cars and people flood the streets. It's a growing city, they say. Hosting one of the biggest online empires for shopping and delivery, it's still going through growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone's focused on their own goals, and nobody expects much from anyone else. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you be. It's not like the South, where a little concern means you really care. People here don't pry into each other's lives. You can keep your walls up as long as you want, and the city just rolls along like waves on the beach. It's a vibrant place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur singers upstairs, there's always something happening. In a way, we're less like an apartment building full of strangers and more like a community of friends. We come together for birthdays, funerals, and to help each other out when needed.  \n\nI'm lucky to be here, honestly. I like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I try to keep things tidy, leave them snacks, and they do the same for me. We trade mail, and it's nice to see each other. I think they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, impersonal modern complex, but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't completely mess things up.",
            "My neighborhood is like, the definition of cookie-cutter suburbia. You know, the kind where the homeowner's association is basically running the show.  Step inside, and it's a parade of identical single-family homes, all perfectly manicured lawns, matching driveways, and those little patches of pebbles everyone loves.  Oh, and don't forget the two-car garages, standard issue for every house.   You'll be cruising down these freshly paved roads, and it's like, zero potholes in sight.  Most houses are single-story, but sometimes you'll bump into a two-story one.  Mailboxes are a little different here too. No individual boxes out front, instead, it's more like an apartment building deal – a big cluster of mailboxes at the end of the street, everyone using a key to grab their own. And there are these giant lockers for packages, just in case those aren't small enough.  Thanks, HOA, for keeping things, well, *uniform*.\n\nLiving on the outskirts of the city, my neighborhood's kind of a mix of suburbia and rural.  We've got a ton of space.\n\nMultiple community pools, all gated and sparkling clean.  And these walking trails that snake through the neighborhood, perfect for your daily dog walk or a quiet evening stroll. No need to find a park, you can just run laps around the whole place.  Most people here are retired folks, super friendly and always looking out for each other.  You've got your share of middle-aged and young professionals mixed in too.  \n\nThe city itself is surprisingly big, but it's got that small-town vibe.  We've got the essentials, like one mall (not huge, but it gets the job done).  About a 15-minute drive gets you to all the big box stores you could ever want, from fancy organic grocery stores to those bargain outlets with barely any staff. \n\nAll in all, my neighborhood's pretty typical, safe, well-kept, and boring.  Nice things, like pools and trails, but not exactly a party scene.  You want something, hop in the car and it’s a quick trip to whatever chain store you need.",
            "I call this small Midwestern town home, just outside a big city's suburbs. My neighborhood, on the east side, is the least wealthy part of town. Houses are mostly rented or owned by folks who aren't rolling in dough. But it's not a bad place to live. My neighbors are mostly friendly folks who wave and say hello when I'm out and about. Sure, crime rates are a tad higher than in other parts of town, but they're not out of control. There have been a few violent incidents nearby over the past decade, including some shootings and even a homicide. Our next-door neighbors lost their son last year in a shooting outside a local bar, which was heartbreaking. Luckily, our family has stayed safe, though we've had the occasional porch pirate make off with something if we're not careful.\n\nThe \"opioid epidemic\" has hit our town pretty hard, like a lot of places in the US. It's stolen too many lives due to fentanyl overdoses. Thankfully, there are resources here, like rehab centers and Narcan training for families and friends dealing with addiction. \n\nDespite these struggles, there's a lot to love about our town. My son's elementary school has a fantastic staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. He's thrived there, even with his special needs, because the school has such a positive atmosphere, and he hasn't faced any bullying. We have a super active Parent Teacher Organization that throws events all year to get families involved and boost learning.  Since over 20% of our town lives below the poverty line, the school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so no kid goes hungry. They make sure no one feels less than because they can't afford things, and school fees, supplies, and field trips are really reasonable.\n\nThe City Council has put effort into sprucing up town, repaving roads, landscaping, and fixing up parks. Most of these improvements are downtown and on the west side, where the shops and traffic are. The east side, where I live, tends to get overlooked, which a lot of people in our neighborhood find frustrating.\n\nOverall, I'm happy living here. People are friendly, the schools are great, we've got enough shopping options (both small businesses and big chains) to get what we need, and our house might not be worth much, but it's comfortable and fits our family. We've been here for over 16 years, and can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is bursting with character. It's perched on a hill, surrounded by buildings with stories to tell. I live in a seven-story apartment building right across from the old live theater, and just down the street is this awesome little arcade bar that draws all sorts of people on warm summer nights. You'll often see a line snaking down the block, especially on weekends during June and July. A few blocks up is the nearest city park, surprisingly spacious for the area. It's surrounded by concrete with steep stairs built right into the wall. During the harsh winter months, homeless people set up tidy rows of tents along the sidewalk and those wide stairs. It doesn't snow much, but the rainstorms in mid-winter can be brutal, making it tough to stay warm.  Clustering their tents together in the heart of town instead of out in the open keeps them warmer and they're within walking distance of the only family center for miles, where they can shower and clean up. What I truly love about my city, though, isn't the beauty of its history – the towering buildings, the architecture that climbs the hills rolling down to the ocean. It's the people that make my neighborhood special.  Hilltop used to be the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. Even three decades later, you still hear stories about the feds and the DEA cracking down, trying to clean up the streets. The people remember. Those stories are passed down through generations, even to newcomers like me. They work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher areas in the city, to keep it clean and safe. They care about their city, their block. People say if you're white, you shouldn't walk around Hilltop after dark. I think it's a relic of the old days, tinged with the bitterness of social conditioning. Maybe because I'm dark enough to pass for something other than a \"white girl,\" or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of their own, someone who understands the constant reminders of racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions that stem from ignorance and fear, even in a city that's supposed to be a melting pot of cultures. One thing's for sure: no matter where I go, Hilltop will always feel like home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more often offered me a jacket than tried to rob me. It's a place where the laundromat owner stayed open late so I could charge my phone when I was caught in the rain. It's a place where, huddled against a concrete storefront on a bleak night, I felt invisible, only to have someone stop, look me in the eye, hand me five dollars, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I call home a little slice of Rural America, specifically a small town in Michigan. You'll find fields of crops transitioning into quaint tourist spots, but forget big city amenities like malls, Wal-Mart, Target, or even an Applebee's.  Getting around means hopping in the car because everything's a drive.  Even with that,  I think I live in one of the most beautiful places on Earth, surrounded by water. My town sits snuggled between Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix –  think beaches just steps away no matter where you are. \n\nMy neighborhood screams \"small town USA.\" Houses aren't crammed together, and they're not those cookie-cutter creations. They're older homes, some spruced up and modernized, others keeping their vintage charm. Most have full basements you can easily spot from the street.  You'll see a mix of aluminum siding, with houses painted in every color imaginable lining the streets. Most have yards, complete with trampolines, playsets, gardens, and fences for the family pets. They paint a picture of hard-working folks, raising families or enjoying the fruits of their labor. \n\nKids zoom up and down the sidewalks, you'll spot people walking dogs, biking, or rollerblading.  There's a real sense of community here; neighbors know each other, and you can quickly tell who belongs and who's just passing through.  You'll see someone grilling out and get a friendly wave, or a passerby walking their dog will offer a warm smile. Lawns are well-kept; no piles of leaves, just neat, mowed grass and trimmed bushes. It's not about flashy mansions, but about a place that feels like home. It's quiet, peaceful, and safe – a place you'd want to raise a family. \n\nThe county sheriff's department and jail are within walking distance, followed by the health department. The city's recycling center is just down the road, serving residents from all corners. Nearby, you'll find baseball and softball fields, where you can hear the excitement of the announcers and the cheers of the crowd. Our small town airport sits right next to it, so you'll hear the rumble of small planes taking off and landing, whether you're inside or outside.  A quick stroll takes you to the local ice cream shop, and if you're feeling ambitious, you can bike or walk into downtown.\n\nMy kids can ride their bikes to the park, just eight blocks away. It's a truly great place to live."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "My city's a real melting pot, a crazy mix of everything. Residential areas pop up everywhere, kinda randomly tucked between shops and offices. You've got your big chains, sure, but there's also tons of cool, independent boutiques popping up on every street corner. It's like a constant exploration, even just walking around. Oh, and don't even get me started on the food! New restaurants are opening left and right, there's always something new to try.  Plus, there are a couple of parks nearby, always packed with families and kids.\n\nSpeaking of diversity, man, this place is wild. You've got your LGBTQ+ community, Orthodox Jews, even a whole bunch of folks who've resettled from the former Soviet Union, all in one small spot. And if you venture a little further out, you've got your \"Chinatown,\" \"Koreatown,\" \"Little Armenia\" - it's like a mini-United Nations out there.  \n\nThe thing is, getting around can be a nightmare. Everyone drives, so traffic is insane, especially during rush hour.  It's a 10-mile drive, but it can easily turn into a two-hour commute.  Even though lots of cool stuff is close by, it feels like everything is spread out forever.  \n\nThey're building tons of apartment buildings, trying to keep up with everyone moving in, but it feels like things are getting more crowded every day. More people, more cars, it's a recipe for disaster.  \n\nBut hey, there's still some variety in the types of places people live. You've got your typical apartment buildings, sure, but also houses, duplexes, little condo complexes -  it's not all concrete jungle.  And the people? Well, it's a mix of ages, and honestly, I don't know most of my neighbors. Not like it used to be when I was a kid, hanging out with the other kids on the block. It's different now, but hey, that's life in the big city, right?",
            "My neighborhood's kinda unique. Most houses are single-family, but some have been split into two, still connected though, you know? My place has a small yard out front and a tiny driveway on the side. It's got that classic suburban vibe, like a snapshot of the American Dream from not too long ago. It used to feel like everyone was chasing that dream, but now it seems like it's pulling away from some folks. \n\nBut still, our neighborhood holds onto it, whispers that the dream's still alive. People aren't as optimistic as they used to be, the yards aren't kept up like they used to be, but there's still a car or two in every driveway, and the kids are out playing like the world's their playground. The old public school, almost 90 years young, still stands, promising a future to the kids and a blast from the past for the older folks. Churches are sparse, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are always packed. \n\nEvery house looks different, but there’s a familiar feeling in them all. There's a big supermarket called Super \"A\", owned by a huge Yemeni family, probably the only Arab family around.

There used to be a karate school, but when Hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids lost interest. Now it's a pharmacy, 'cause apparently, drugs fix everything. \n\nThere's also a small movie theatre showing old films for cheap, ignored by the kids who want the latest releases, but loved by the elders who don't mind a night out without the kids. And there's this single expressway that cuts through town, even though the entrance and exit are in the next town over. Years ago, they tried to get an exit for our town, but the elders said it would ruin everything, and they convinced the city council to say no. \n\nNow they're building a new high school, and we're trying to pick a mascot.  I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the perfect symbol for my town.",
            "You might not notice it at first glance. It's tucked away behind a strip mall, not the kind of place you'd expect to find a community. But if you venture behind the old, boarded-up Whole Foods and past the hotels that are mostly empty except for a few summer weeks filled with family reunions, you'll discover a thriving neighborhood.  These communities are hidden along the road, with apartment complexes lining up beside each other like carefully disassembled Russian nesting dolls. The first complex you'll come across has been in the news for some not-so-nice things, so we'll skip over those. But the complexes next door, and the ones after that, are a whole different story, a secret known only to a few. Across from them sits a quiet branch of a community college.  Students stroll in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 a.m., starting their day. The iron gates creak open to let them in, while commuters grumble and shake their fists at the traffic delays on busier days. The road takes a turn, leading to another residential street, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for those recovering from injuries on the other. The center has cheerful porch furniture and a ceiling fan that lazily stirs the warm summer air. Kids play in the park, cartwheeling and running through the tall grass while bees buzz around the flower beds.  Older folks walk their dogs, eyeing the teenagers skateboarding and nodding politely at the girls huddled by the playground, gossiping about boys and the latest online trends.  There's a sushi place in a nearby strip mall with cheap eats, a swimming supply store right next to it, and a nail salon tucked in between. You could easily spend an afternoon getting a manicure, grabbing lunch, and stocking up on pool supplies all in one place. There's even a self-serve frozen yogurt shop where teens often congregate, slurping down their cold treats while skateboarding and vaping. This neighborhood is a snapshot of classic Americana, a piece of history in the sleepy south where time seems to stand still.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove past fields of corn stretching out as far as the eye could see. I knew she'd be surprised by how empty and open the landscape was. She was from a town where you could walk to the grocery store in five minutes—she'd never seen anything like this before. Overwhelmed by the endless cornfields, I told her about growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood who I was and where I came from.\n\nWe continued down a two-lane country road until we reached a quarry filled with water. Just past it was a small development where I live. The houses were mostly made of brick and stucco, each with at least half an acre of land that everyone took pride in keeping up. In the spring, the yards burst with colorful flowers, alongside the midwestern trees that changed colors with the seasons.  The driveways were lined with shiny, high-end Mercedes-Benz cars that gleamed in the afternoon sun after a good wash.\n\nAs we drove towards my grey stucco house, my Korean neighbor was outside, as always, with a friendly smile. He spent the whole day mowing his lawn, his singing voice carrying over the hum of the mower. Everyone in the neighborhood found it amusing, but he was a genuine, amazing guy with a fascinating past. He was a doctor once, and though he's gotten older and a little slower, he still blends right in with his John Deere mower.\n\nFinally, we reached my house. In the side yard, geese honked loudly and were chased around by our terrier.  Behind the house was a small stream that flowed into the quarry.  We could hear the bullfrogs, the gurgling stream, and the occasional \"moo\" from the nearby farms. A handmade wooden bridge crossed the stream, leading to a secluded spot filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was my childhood haven.  I built tree forts there and \"hunted\" (mostly chasing) animals, always finding something to do with a neighborhood friend by my side.\n\nThe winters in my small town could be brutal, but they were also beautiful. The yard transformed from a lush green into a stark wilderness. Trees that once bloomed with pink, purple, and orange flowers stood bare, their branches like skeletons against the sky. But when it snowed, a winter wonderland appeared overnight. The backyard was covered with snow angels made by my little sister and snowmen. We fought constantly as kids, and during winter, snowballs were our weapons of choice. We built massive igloo-like forts to store our branches-and-rock arsenal. In our own winter wonderland, we played pretend, forgetting about everything else. We were just carefree kids.",
            "Alright, so you wanna know about Portland, Oregon? Well, \"weird\" is the name of the game here.  There's this one place, a pizza joint, bar, music venue, and, let's just say, a \"spirited\" establishment all rolled into one, that sums it up perfectly with their slogan: \"Keep Portland Weird.\" For some folks, it's a throwback to the good ol' days, the 90s and early 2000s, when Portland was a hidden gem, not overrun with fancy Californians and their shiny condos.  For others, it's an open invitation: come hang with us, we're weird here, and we mean it as a compliment.\n\nLook, even with all the fancy folks moving in and the construction boom, Portland still holds onto its weirdness. It's not about blindly accepting everything, mind you, but it's about embracing the unconventional. We've got our share of modern stuff, just like every other city – we even get most of our stuff from China. \n\nThere are tons of ways to be weird, to be anything but normal, but Portland has its fair share of normal folks too: yoga buffs, hipsters, business types. Maybe weirdness is just about taking things a little less seriously. \n\nTake my neighborhood, for example. We've got colorful houses, gardens bursting with flowers, herbs, and veggies, and something called \"free boxes\" popping up in the summer. These aren't your average cardboard boxes, though. They're treasure troves, filled with random stuff people are getting rid of – clothes, books, you name it. It's like a magical hunt for forgotten gems.  \n\nThat's the Portland vibe, at least to me. I'm just one weird dude among thousands. Some folks I know wouldn't dream of digging through a box on the sidewalk. They're more into goat yoga (yes, real goats!) or cheering on the Timbers, our local soccer team.\n\nPortland's a melting pot of passions. People chase their dreams, or at least dream about chasing them while enjoying a few too many drinks at the bar.\n\nSure, we have our problems, like drug issues, homelessness, and the ever-present drizzle. We're not immune to those struggles, just like any other city. But hey, it's all part of the Portland experience. We're weird, we're flawed, and we're trying to figure it all out, one free box at a time.",
            "The mountains, they're always there, man. Always watching over this town. Even when I'm bogged down with work and life, even when I forget about them, they're just sitting there, strong and silent. But on those days when I'm stressed to the max,  they seem to call to me. When I look up at them, they give me this sense of calm, like they're saying, \"Hey, you'll get through this, one step at a time.\"  I first saw them when I moved here for college. They were the first thing that really blew me away. Sure, the campus is pretty with its buildings, ponds, and trees, but those mountains, they're the real deal. The rest of the town is cool too, you know? There are tons of cafes where I spent countless hours fueled by caffeine and studying. And if you head downtown, it's like stepping back in time with all the old brick buildings.  It's surprisingly vibrant for a small town.  But just a short walk away, you're back in that peaceful small-town vibe.  It's this crazy mix of energy and chill that makes this place so special.  It's easy to make memories here, good and bad. I've had some epic nights with friends in the park after pulling all-nighters, and there are those times when I've just needed to sit by the pond and let it all out. You know, those existential crises that hit in the middle of the night.  Watching the turtles and ducks, I'd wonder about my place in the world.  One day, I was walking through town, past the ponds and houses, and I found myself heading north. And there they were, my mountain buddies, standing tall against the sunrise. They were like a silent reminder to keep going, to persevere. They're always there, you know?",
            "Okay, so you're thinking of checking out Bensonhurst, Brooklyn? Easy peasy! Getting there's a breeze thanks to the city's awesome public transport. You'll feel right at home here, it's textbook New York City vibes.  Get ready for a major dose of Asian culture – seriously, it's like every block has a shop run by Asian folks. Supermarkets and laundromats are everywhere, and trust me, they're the real deal. The food's top-notch, prices are killer, and let's be honest, convenience is king. Just a hop, skip, and a jump from where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within spitting distance of each other. Talk about grocery goals!\n\nNow, don't get me wrong, Bensonhurst isn't just an Asian enclave. It's a melting pot of cultures, with immigrants and their families making it a real mix.  While most of the big businesses are Asian-owned, there's also a recently revamped park nearby that's got something for everyone. Think basketball courts, soccer fields, handball courts, swings, a playground, and even a water fountain to keep the little ones happy.  It's the classic New York City park experience – tons of diversity, everyone just chilling and getting along.\n\nForget those towering corporate buildings – you'll mostly find co-ops, condos, and two-family houses here. The people are generally nice, though they can be a bit loud.  Expect your daily dose of car horns and engines revving up, especially in the mornings.\n\nAs for safety, Bensonhurst is pretty chill during the day, but you gotta watch your back at night. Like any city, there's always a chance you might encounter some troublemakers, bullies, or even thieves. I've had my share of run-ins in the past, but that was ages ago. Lately, package theft has been a bit of an issue. And let's not forget the ever-present dog mess – despite the city's rules, people seem to forget about picking up after their furry friends. You'll be dodging poop more often than not! \n\nJust keep your wits about you, watch your step, and you'll be golden!",
            "My neighborhood is a bit of a different world.  The streets are all uphill, with my house perched right at the top of the steepest incline.  They call it \"workout hill\" because it's a favorite spot for joggers.  There aren't any sidewalks, so everyone walks right on the road which is a bit bumpy and rough in places.  The power lines look kinda haphazard because they get knocked down by branches and storms all the time. We get loads of rain and wind here. The area's choked with tall evergreen trees, but people here aren't fans. They try to chop them down as much as possible because they block the ocean view.  That's why a lot of houses are built way up high, with huge, glassy second floors jutting out to capture the vista.\n\nSunsets are breathtaking, with the water glowing below and the sky turning fiery orange. But most days are cloudy and hazy, so you don't get to see a lot of sun.  Everything gets covered in moss – roofs, cars, even railings. Once I left my car parked for a month and it grew this whole green, fuzzy coat of moss. Took ages to scrub it off!\n\nThere aren't many kids around, though there's a school not too far away. Mostly, it's older folks, many of them retired.  Instead of kids, people have dogs. You see them everywhere, hanging out in lawns or chasing each other down the street. They're pretty brazen and might even sneak into your house if you leave a door or window open. I found one chilling in my living room once, had to politely escort it back outside!\n\nRabbits roam everywhere, some pretty big ones. Gardeners hate them because they dig up plants and burrow in lawns. My cats, though, love them and have pretty much wiped them out around our place. We also have the usual birds – sparrows, hummingbirds, and sometimes even hawks or eagles, until the crows chase them away.\n\nThere aren't any shops nearby, but if you head down to the waterfront, there are a few restaurants serving up fresh seafood. The beach isn't much to write home about, but the rocks along the shore are fun to toss into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide, so you can see the other side even on misty days.",
            "My neighborhood's pretty typical - a quiet suburban street in a small Tennessee town, smack-dab between two state highways. That means we get more traffic than I'd prefer, but other than that, it's chill. Folks here tend to stick around, so I've gotten to know most of the neighbors.  Life's mostly about yards, chores, and the usual neighbourhood grind. In winter, we turn our side street into a sledding hill.  Living at the corner, we practically have a front-row seat to everyone's comings and goings. We know whose car is whose, so any strange vehicle catches our eye.  Some folks walk for exercise or to walk their dogs, kids cruise around on bikes, you know, the usual.\n\nWe work from home, my wife and I, with our two daughters, eleven and fourteen.  We're pretty much homebodies, so everyone's used to seeing us around. We're out playing in the yard, even in the rain sometimes. We fire up the grill on the back deck occasionally, and the smell of barbecue just makes it feel extra cozy.  I swear, there's always someone mowing their lawn around here, from March to October when the grass finally decides to chill. We've got tons of trees, the neighborhood used to be all woods, so there's plenty of shade, but come autumn, it's a leaf-raking extravaganza.  I kinda love the smell of burning leaves, though, so that's a nice reminder that Fall's here.  We haven't had much of a winter lately, just feels like a super long Fall.  Our garage is at the back, so we hardly ever use the front door unless someone's knocking. I tinker with my truck and other projects in there, and with the doors open, it feels like I'm more in tune with the neighborhood. Holidays are pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving brings some out-of-town folks and an explosion of cars, same with Mother's Day and Christmas. Overall, it's a pretty sweet spot to live.  If it weren't for the traffic, it'd be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is smack-dab in the middle of the high desert, a land of dirt, dirt, and more dirt. Unless you've lived here, you can't truly grasp the feeling of constantly seeing brown.  When you do spot a lush lawn, you know that homeowner is shelling out big bucks for upkeep. Back in the 90s when I first moved here, houses were spread out like stars in the night sky. Now it's still pretty spread out, but there are a ton more houses popping up.  Honestly, it's starting to feel more and more like a city every day, though I guess that's happening everywhere.\n\nMost folks around here are super friendly, just like in any city, there are good parts and not-so-good parts.  My neighborhood is surrounded by friendly older folks, so I guess you could say it's a pretty decent place to live.\n\nWhen it comes to shopping, we're mostly stuck with chain stores like Food4Less and Smart & Final.  If you're craving something upscale, you've got to hit the road. I rarely see any Whole Foods or similar stores around here. \n\nBased on what I see, construction seems to be the biggest industry in town. I think that's because our city is still growing, with tons of open space ready for development. It kind of freaks me out, though. I like things the way they are now.  I left a big city and don't have any desire to go back.\n\nSpeaking of construction, that's what I do for a living. I'm a drywall and T-bar installer.\n\nWhat I love most about my home is the wildlife. People flock to the high desert for its stark beauty, and that includes the unique ecosystems that exist here. It's important for us who live here to learn about the animals who share this environment so we can coexist peacefully. My family and I have definitely gotten used to sharing our space with the locals. My three kids are obsessed with lizards and desert bugs. Right now, they're outside catching all sorts of critters.\n\nWhen it comes to attractions, we've got a few. Victorville is a great place for families who want to experience the desert firsthand. If you're planning a visit, try to time it with the San Bernardino County Fair – a fun event with plenty to see and do. And if you're feeling adventurous, head over to nearby Wrightwood for some snow sports in the winter.\n\nHistory buffs will appreciate the Victor Valley Museum, which houses geological and paleontological finds, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of Victorville's growth.",
            "So, when people ask me about my neighborhood, things get a little weird. You know, the usual homeowners with their backyards and barbecues? Not my scene. My neighborhood is the college campus, my dorm is my home base, and the people who live there with me are my crew.  Sure, the surrounding campus is part of it too, but my dorm life is where it's at.  \n\nBut hey, even though it's a little different, my neighborhood still has the basics.  There are \"houses\" - apartments, regular houses, and dorm buildings - just like anywhere else.  Apartments usually have a few people per room, maybe 20 in a whole building.  Then there are the houses, mostly for alumni, but they're spread out. And of course, the dorms, packed with hundreds of students, two to a room, that's where most of us live. \n\nThe people here are another story.  My school is all about diversity, so my neighborhood is a melting pot of cultures and ages.  Professors tend to live in the houses, younger students are in the dorms, and the older ones? Apartments for them. It's a vibrant mix!\n\nAnd just like any neighborhood, we've got stores and a park.  We've got all the usual spots to grab a bite, plus school-specific stores for clothes and groceries.  Everything you need is right here!  The park is our spot to chill, always clean and safe because we all look out for each other.",
            "So, I've been here for about 10 years now, so I guess I can share some stories about my time in this neighborhood. When I first moved here from Riverdale to Stockbridge, I have to admit, I was pretty bummed. I missed my old place and the people there. But my parents wanted what was best for me and my little sister – a better house, a better school, you know, a \"not ghetto\" kind of vibe. It took some time to adjust, but I made some new friends and, yeah, a few enemies along the way. I never really got close to the neighbors, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis for a bit, since they lived right next door. They've been like family to me in a way, and I'm really grateful for them.\n\nI remember when my family went to Mr. Glen's wedding (they got remarried!). It was a blast – tons of dancing, good food, good company. It made me think about my own future, about finding someone special and giving them a life they deserve.  Speaking of the wedding, I actually caught the little white strap Mr. Glen's wife, Ms. Veda, threw! Sadly, I didn't catch the bouquet. I had a great time chatting with Marsharii, one of their daughters, but I haven't seen her since.  I hope she's doing well.\n\nThis neighborhood is like a maze, but now with GPS, I'm exploring more. I mostly stick to hanging out with my friends Kason and Curtis, especially when we're playing video games. We used to spend hours at it, just enjoying life. A lot of times I'd head to the park to relax and soak up some nature. It's so peaceful there.  Sometimes, I even practice my balance with some sticks I got from Home Depot, and maybe even bring along my bokken wooden sword for a little training. \n\nThere's also a basketball and tennis court, even though I haven't played either in a while.  It's nice to have them there just in case I feel like getting back into it. My dad and I used to play tennis with Mr. Graves all the time – he really pushed us, but it was always fun. \n\nLooking back, I've had so many good times in this neighborhood, but those are the ones that really stand out. I'm excited to see what the future holds!",
            "My pad's a stone's throw from my college, which is a major plus. It's mostly apartments around here, with a few decent, budget-friendly bars and eats thrown in.  One bar just got a fancy name change, and now it's a tad pricey, but the drinks and service aren't terrible.  The folks here are mostly chill – college kids or those on a tighter budget, since rents aren't exactly sky-high. There are tons of kids around 'cause there's an elementary school within spitting distance. Don't know my neighbors too well – kinda good that way. They're a bit...enthusiastic about their weed, so the building management put an air freshener right outside their door. Hilarious, yet kinda insulting, you know? \n\nThe buildings around here are mostly old-school looking, but some have been spruced up inside. There are some shiny new apartments down the street, but they scream \"cheap construction, inflated rent.\" They're basically cashing in on the college crowd.  Speaking of cheap eats, there's this place five minutes away that serves everything on paper plates – it's mostly microwaved stuff, but hey, it's cheap. Across the street is a gas station that supposedly has a horrible work environment. But thanks to some city dough, they redid the road last summer. Now there's a decent sidewalk, grassy medians, the whole nine yards. Makes the place feel a bit nicer.\n\nMy building is tucked away under a canopy of trees – they chopped down a few, leaving some gnarly stumps behind, but there are still plenty left. Behind my complex is a line of trees, then another set of apartments. I'm on 42nd street, but behind me is 43rd. Not as charming, let's just say that. Sidewalks are crumbling, buildings look rough around the edges, and there are more trees, probably to hide the shabbiness. Most of the crime around here seems to be concentrated in one complex on 43rd, but then again, another complex across the street has its share of issues too.  \n\nBut hey, I dig my spot. It's affordable, and it's got everything I need. Plus, the uni's a walk away, and there are two bus stops that get me to the shops and downtown in a flash.",
            "My neighborhood is like stepping back in time. It's made up of identical duplexes on a cul-de-sac, all painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. They're spaced out so they look like individual houses, and most of the neighbors know each other. We often gather at the end of driveways in the evenings, chatting while the kids play. It's a refreshing change from the constant hustle and bustle of the digital world.  \n\nWe're surrounded by fields and trees, with endless blue skies and fluffy clouds. It's pretty idyllic, but we've had some crazy weather lately. Tornado warnings have become common, and last night, we actually heard the sirens! I ended up in the bathtub with my smallest dog, my purse, and a few pillows, while my big dog stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The neighborhood was eerily quiet except for the sound of hail pummeling the ground.\n\nAfter the storm passed, the road was literally steaming from the temperature change. It went from 92 degrees to 75 in a flash! The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement. As the clouds cleared, a double rainbow appeared. I grabbed my camera and snapped some pictures to share with everyone. It was breathtaking.\n\nFor an hour after the storm, the neighborhood was deserted. Then, people started trickling back home. It was back to normal pretty quickly, with moms and kids outside again as dinner cooked. \n\nMy apartment is a two-bedroom, two-bath, just like everyone else's, though some of the apartments inside are surprisingly small. It's a friendly neighborhood, and I love the southern accents. I enjoy walking in the big field behind my place and strolling down to the pond (not for swimming, though!). I've even seen deer and heard the croaking of a giant bullfrog in the mornings. It's a fantastic place to live, just forty minutes outside Charlotte.\n\nEvery morning, we're woken up by the sound of roosters crowing from the nearby farms. It feels like living in a small village. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that brays in the evenings. I feel so lucky to have found this amazing neighborhood.",
            "Moving into this neighborhood right before eighth grade was a bit tough at first, friendship-wise. I eventually clicked with a couple of guys, one two houses down and another on my street. They've since moved away, but those memories stick with me. Most of the folks who were here when I first arrived are still around. It's pretty much your typical American suburb: loads of two-story houses, the sound of kids playing outside whenever the weather's good, and a generally quiet atmosphere most days. \n\nI haven't had any bad experiences with anyone here. You're left to your own devices unless you need something, and I've never had a package disappear from my porch. I feel pretty comfortable trusting my neighbors.\n\nThere's a park just a stone's throw away, packed with memories. We played basketball, football, and baseball there with the neighborhood crew. I even got clocked in the nose during a football game, which isn't my fondest memory, but the good times definitely outweigh the bad. These days, I mostly go there to hang out with my cousins' kids – they're still into swings, slides, and all that good stuff. Just the thought of the park gets them pumped. It brings back a lot of nostalgia for me.\n\nThe neighborhood's pretty diverse, with a whole bunch of different food options within walking distance. You can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants all within a mile. Of course, these days everyone's relying on apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for delivery. The usual suspects – fast food joints and pizza places – are plentiful, just like in any suburb.\n\nWe've got everything we need in terms of stores: dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, a Jewel-Osco grocery store (a Midwest favorite), and even an Indian-owned store for those craving homemade or ready-made Indian food. \n\nOverall, I love my neighborhood. Reading about other people's crazy neighbor stories online and on the news makes me appreciate mine even more.",
            "My town, Johnston, is a typical South Carolina town - nothing fancy, but it plays a big role in the farming world. It's known as the Peach Capital of the World, a title it proudly flaunts on its welcome sign.  Everywhere you look, it's either peach orchards or cattle farms. Houses outside the main part of town are spread out, mostly two-story homes with metal roofs to beat the summer heat or gray shingles. They're usually tucked away from the road, leaving space for fields in front.\n\nDowntown, you'll find a single traffic light where everything else hangs out. There are just a few stores in town:  Hong Kong, a small Chinese place run by a family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a local burger chain. A pizzeria used to be there but closed recently. There's also Maxwell and Halford Drug, a tiny family pharmacy famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola. The only grocery store is Independent Grocers Alliance (IGA), but it's pricey and most people head to a Walmart in the next town for their shopping.  Dollar General is the most popular spot, though. It's always packed with folks grabbing everyday essentials.\n\nThere's also a friendly furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a local favorite. It's been around forever and even has movers to deliver your new couch! Attached to the furniture store is Clark's Cuts and Kennels for all your pet grooming needs.\n\nThe doctor and vet's offices are further out from the main area, but they're well-equipped. There's only one elementary school, Johnston Elementary, but kids have to go to the next town for middle and high school.  \n\nWe're working on a 2.5-acre park, but right now, there aren't many places to hang out.  No movie theaters, bowling alleys, playgrounds, or even a specific dog park. It's a quiet town, easy to miss if you blink!",
            "So, the first time I heard about my building, I was listening to a podcast about missing persons. It was a bit of a surprise, considering how expensive this place is - every apartment here is over a thousand dollars a month! None of my friends had ever heard of any stories like that either. Maybe it's the struggle, you know? I know a few friends who cry themselves to sleep at night because things are so expensive. But we've learned to be frugal, to find joy in the dusty charm of flea market finds and vintage clothes. You kind of lose your sense of smell as you get older, or maybe you just get used to the way things are. But that flea market vibe, it always sticks around. It's the smell of old magazines piled on a dusty piano, clinging to your worn leather jacket even after you've washed it. There are three thrift stores within walking distance of my place. If you start at one end, you can hit up two charity shops, a library, a rare book store, and a quirky little curio shop. Downtown is packed with cars and people every morning, but inside those thrift stores, it's always eerily quiet. No matter how busy the streets are, the stores are sanctuaries of calm, perfect for escaping for an afternoon. Every year, there are more and more buildings going up, more cars and people flooding the streets. It's a growing city, they say, with one of the biggest online empires for e-commerce and delivery. It's still figuring things out, like a teenager going through awkward phases. It reminds me of New York, actually. Everyone's focused on their own thing, and nobody really expects you to do much more than stay out of their way. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people won't bat an eye. It's not like the South, where showing a little bit of concern is considered caring. Nobody really pries into your life here. You can keep your walls up as high as you want, and the city will just keep rolling on, like waves crashing on the beach. It's a lively place, for sure. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur singers upstairs, there's always something going on. I guess we're more of a community than just a bunch of strangers living in the same building. We come together for birthdays, funerals, to help each other out. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. We look out for each other, share food, help with errands. It's nice to see familiar faces, and I think they enjoy my company as much as I enjoy theirs. I live in this massive, impersonal concrete jungle, but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I haven't completely screwed up my life.",
            "This place I live in? Picture your standard, cookie-cutter suburb.  Seriously, it's like they used a template. You can practically thank the homeowner's association for the perfectly manicured lawns and identical front yards –  a little patch of grass, some pebbles, and driveways that are way too short. Every now and then you'll spot a sad little tree trying to make its way. Everyone's got a two-car garage, and the roads are like something out of a dream, all freshly paved with nary a pothole in sight. Most houses are single-story, but sometimes you'll stumble across a two-story one, breaking the monotony.  \n\nBut forget about those individual mailboxes you see everywhere else. Nope, here it's all communal. Big clusters of mailboxes at the end of the street, accessed with a key, and two massive lockers for packages. Gotta love the HOA's obsession with, well, everything being the same.\n\nMy house sits on the fringe of the city, so it's a bit of a weird mix – part rural, part suburbia.  We've got tons of space, which is cool. There are community pools (gated and fancy, of course), walking trails for your dog or your existential crisis, and enough space to run around and get your workout in.\n\nMostly, it's populated by retirees, which makes it super safe and everyone's always looking out for each other.  There are a few middle-aged and younger folks like me thrown in for good measure.\n\nThe city itself is a beast, surprisingly populous but still feeling like a small town. It has everything you need – one mall, which isn't huge but gets the job done. A 15-minute drive takes you to a world of shopping: organic grocery stores, bargain bins with staff who look like they'd rather be anywhere else... you name it.\n\nSo, yeah, my neighborhood is safe, clean, and pretty standard. It's nice, we've got amenities, and we're not too far from the action.",
            "I call my hometown a small Midwestern town, just outside the suburbs of a big city. The part of town I live in, on the east side, is the poorest. Houses are mostly rented or owned by folks who struggle financially, and property values are low. But it's not a bad place to be. My neighbors are friendly folks who always wave hello when I'm out walking. Sure, crime rates are a tad higher than other areas, but they're still pretty low overall. There have been a few violent incidents in the past ten years, a few shootings and even a homicide, all within a few blocks of my house. Last year, the family next door lost their son in a shooting outside a bar. Thankfully, our family has been lucky enough to avoid anything serious – just the occasional missing item from the porch if we forget to bring it inside.\n\nThis town, like many places, has been hit hard by the opioid crisis. Too many lives have been lost to fentanyl overdoses.  But there are good things happening too. We have several addiction recovery centers and Narcan training programs for families and friends impacted by this epidemic.\n\nDespite the challenges, there are a lot of good things about this town. My son's elementary school is amazing. From the principal to the teachers and support staff, everyone is dedicated. He's actually thrived there, even with his special needs, because the atmosphere is so positive. There’s a very active PTO that organizes events throughout the year to keep families involved and learning fun.\n\nBecause over 20% of our town lives below the poverty line, the school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students. No one feels less than because of their financial situation, and school fees, supplies, and field trips are affordable.\n\nThe City Council has made some improvements to the town, like fixing roads, planting trees, and sprucing up parks. Most of these upgrades are in the center of town and on the west side, where the shops and traffic are. The east side, where I live, tends to get overlooked, which is frustrating for us.\n\nOverall, I'm happy living here. People are friendly, the schools are great, there are plenty of stores, and our house might not be worth much, but it’s comfortable and homey. We’ve lived here for over 16 years, and I can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is bursting with character. It's perched on a hill, surrounded by buildings steeped in history. I live in a seven-story apartment building directly across from an old theater, and just a block down is a quirky arcade bar that draws all sorts of folks on warm summer nights. Especially during June and July, weekends often see a line snaking out the door. A few blocks up is the nearest city park, surprisingly spacious for its location. The park is enclosed by concrete, with steep steps built right into the wall. When winter hits, you'll see homeless folks setting up neat rows of tents along the sidewalk and those wide steps. It doesn't snow much here, but the heavy downpours that come in mid-winter make it tough to stay warm. Clustering together in the heart of town instead of out in the wilderness keeps them warmer, plus they're within easy reach of the only family center for miles, where they can shower and freshen up.\n\nBut what I truly love about this city isn't the historical charm – the majestic buildings, the architecture that climbs up the rolling hills towards the ocean. It's the people that make this neighborhood special. \n\nHilltop used to be notorious on the West Coast for gang violence. Even three decades later, you hear whispers of federal agents and the DEA swooping in, trying to clean up the streets.  The stories linger, passed down through generations, reaching even newcomers like me. These folks work hard, even though Hilltop is still considered one of the tougher neighborhoods, to keep things clean and safe. They take pride in their city, their block. You'll hear warnings about not walking around the Hill after dark if you're white – a relic of the past, tinged with the sting of prejudice. Maybe it's because I'm dark-skinned enough to blend in, or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of their own, someone who understands the constant reminders of racism, cultural bias, and assumptions based on ignorance and fear. Even in a city that claims to be a melting pot of cultures. \n\nOne thing's for sure: no matter where I go, Hilltop will always feel like home. The streets hum with life, and I've experienced more kindness than any other place.  People have offered me a jacket in the cold, opened their laundromats late so I could charge my phone in the rain, and even stopped to tell me I'm beautiful and valuable on the dreariest of nights.",
            "I live in a small town in rural Michigan, where farmlands give way to charming tourist spots. There's no bustling city life here – no big malls, chain stores like Walmart or Target, or even a familiar spot like Applebee's. You need a car to get anywhere you want to go.  Despite the lack of big-city amenities, I live in a truly beautiful place surrounded by water. My town is nestled between two stunning lakes – Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other.  Every direction you look, there's a beach within reach.\n\nMy neighborhood embodies the classic small-town feel. Houses aren't crammed together like in a city; they're spread out, each with its own unique character.  Some are older, with a touch of vintage charm, while others have been updated and modernized.  Many even have full basements visible from the street.  You'll find a rainbow of colors on the houses lining the blocks, with most boasting yards filled with trampolines, playsets, gardens, and even fences for animals. It's a picture-perfect representation of Middle America: hardworking families making a living, raising kids, and creating a sense of community.\n\nKids run freely down the streets, while you might also see people walking their dogs, biking, or rollerblading.  Everyone seems to know each other, and you can easily tell who belongs and who's just passing through. A friendly wave from someone grilling outside or a pleasant smile from a neighbor walking their dog a few blocks away is a common occurrence. Lawns are well-maintained, free of piles of leaves, with freshly mowed grass and neatly trimmed bushes.\n\nThis isn't a neighborhood that screams \"luxury,\" but it's the kind of place that makes you think, \"This would be a great place to raise a family.\" It's quiet, peaceful, and safe. While not outwardly glamorous, it embodies the essence of what people crave: a secure and welcoming place to call home.  \n\nWithin walking distance, you'll find the county sheriff's department, the jail, the health department, and the recycling center, all conveniently located and serving the needs of the community. Nearby baseball and softball fields echo with the excitement of games, and the rumble of small planes taking off and landing at our local airport adds a touch of charm to the daily soundtrack.  A short walk takes you to the local ice cream shop, and if you're feeling adventurous, you can even bike or walk downtown. My kids can easily ride their bikes to the park, just eight blocks away.\n\nThis small town is truly a great place to live."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "My city's a real melting pot, a crazy mix of everything. Residential areas pop up everywhere, kinda randomly tucked between shops and offices. You've got your big chains, sure, but there's also tons of cool, independent boutiques popping up on every street corner. It's like a constant exploration, even just walking around. Oh, and don't even get me started on the food! New restaurants are opening left and right, there's always something new to try.

And if you venture a little further out, you've got your \"Chinatown,\" \"Koreatown,\" \"Little Armenia\" - it's like a mini-United Nations out there.  \n\nThe thing is, getting around can be a nightmare. Everyone drives, so traffic is insane, especially during rush hour.  It's a 10-mile drive, but it can easily turn into a two-hour commute.  Even though lots of cool stuff is close by, it feels like everything is spread out forever.  \n\nThey're building tons of apartment buildings, trying to keep up with everyone moving in, but it feels like things are getting more crowded every day. More people, more cars, it's a recipe for disaster.  \n\nBut hey, there's still some variety in the types of places people live. You've got your typical apartment buildings, sure, but also houses, duplexes, little condo complexes -  it's not all concrete jungle.  And the people? Well, it's a mix of ages, and honestly, I don't know most of my neighbors. Not like it used to be when I was a kid, hanging out with the other kids on the block. It's different now, but hey, that's life in the big city, right?",
            "My neighborhood's kinda unique. Most houses are single-family, but some have been split into two, still connected though, you know? My place has a small yard out front and a tiny driveway on the side. It's got that classic suburban vibe, like a snapshot of the American Dream from not too long ago. It used to feel like everyone was chasing that dream, but now it seems like it's pulling away from some folks. \n\nBut still, our neighborhood holds onto it, whispers that the dream's still alive. People aren't as optimistic as they used to be, the yards aren't kept up like they used to be, but there's still a car or two in every driveway, and the kids are out playing like the world's their playground. The old public school, almost 90 years young, still stands, promising a future to the kids and a blast from the past for the older folks. Churches are sparse, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are always packed. \n\nEvery house looks different, but there’s a familiar feeling in them all. There's a big supermarket called Super \"A\", owned by a huge Yemeni family, probably the only Arab family around. Most folks are African American, and the streets are wide, perfect for the kids playing football, only pausing for cars to go by. \n\nMost people here have been around for generations, they can tell stories about a time when everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school, but when Hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids lost interest. Now it's a pharmacy, 'cause apparently, drugs fix everything. \n\nThere's also a small movie theatre showing old films for cheap, ignored by the kids who want the latest releases, but loved by the elders who don't mind a night out without the kids. And there's this single expressway that cuts through town, even though the entrance and exit are in the next town over. Years ago, they tried to get an exit for our town, but the elders said it would ruin everything, and they convinced the city council to say no. \n\nNow they're building a new high school, and we're trying to pick a mascot.  I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the perfect symbol for my town.",
            "You might not notice it at first glance. It's tucked away behind a strip mall, not the kind of place you'd expect to find a community. But if you venture behind the old, boarded-up Whole Foods and past the hotels that are mostly empty except for a few summer weeks filled with family reunions, you'll discover a thriving neighborhood.  These communities are hidden along the road, with apartment complexes lining up beside each other like carefully disassembled Russian nesting dolls. The first complex you'll come across has been in the news for some not-so-nice things, so we'll skip over those. But the complexes next door, and the ones after that, are a whole different story, a secret known only to a few. Across from them sits a quiet branch of a community college.  Students stroll in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 a.m., starting their day. The iron gates creak open to let them in, while commuters grumble and shake their fists at the traffic delays on busier days. The road takes a turn, leading to another residential street, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for those recovering from injuries on the other. The center has cheerful porch furniture and a ceiling fan that lazily stirs the warm summer air. Kids play in the park, cartwheeling and running through the tall grass while bees buzz around the flower beds.  Older folks walk their dogs, eyeing the teenagers skateboarding and nodding politely at the girls huddled by the playground, gossiping about boys and the latest online trends.  There's a sushi place in a nearby strip mall with cheap eats, a swimming supply store right next to it, and a nail salon tucked in between. You could easily spend an afternoon getting a manicure, grabbing lunch, and stocking up on pool supplies all in one place. There's even a self-serve frozen yogurt shop where teens often congregate, slurping down their cold treats while skateboarding and vaping. This neighborhood is a snapshot of classic Americana, a piece of history in the sleepy south where time seems to stand still.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove past fields of corn stretching out as far as the eye could see. I knew she'd be surprised by how empty and open the landscape was. She was from a town where you could walk to the grocery store in five minutes—she'd never seen anything like this before. Overwhelmed by the endless cornfields, I told her about growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood who I was and where I came from.\n\nWe continued down a two-lane country road until we reached a quarry filled with water. Just past it was a small development where I live. The houses were mostly made of brick and stucco, each with at least half an acre of land that everyone took pride in keeping up. In the spring, the yards burst with colorful flowers, alongside the midwestern trees that changed colors with the seasons.  The driveways were lined with shiny, high-end Mercedes-Benz cars that gleamed in the afternoon sun after a good wash.\n\nAs we drove towards my grey stucco house, my Korean neighbor was outside, as always, with a friendly smile. He spent the whole day mowing his lawn, his singing voice carrying over the hum of the mower. Everyone in the neighborhood found it amusing, but he was a genuine, amazing guy with a fascinating past. He was a doctor once, and though he's gotten older and a little slower, he still blends right in with his John Deere mower.\n\nFinally, we reached my house. In the side yard, geese honked loudly and were chased around by our terrier.  Behind the house was a small stream that flowed into the quarry.  We could hear the bullfrogs, the gurgling stream, and the occasional \"moo\" from the nearby farms. A handmade wooden bridge crossed the stream, leading to a secluded spot filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was my childhood haven.  I built tree forts there and \"hunted\" (mostly chasing) animals, always finding something to do with a neighborhood friend by my side.\n\nThe winters in my small town could be brutal, but they were also beautiful. The yard transformed from a lush green into a stark wilderness. Trees that once bloomed with pink, purple, and orange flowers stood bare, their branches like skeletons against the sky. But when it snowed, a winter wonderland appeared overnight. The backyard was covered with snow angels made by my little sister and snowmen. We fought constantly as kids, and during winter, snowballs were our weapons of choice. We built massive igloo-like forts to store our branches-and-rock arsenal. In our own winter wonderland, we played pretend, forgetting about everything else. We were just carefree kids.",
            "Alright, so you wanna know about Portland, Oregon? Well, \"weird\" is the name of the game here.  There's this one place, a pizza joint, bar, music venue, and, let's just say, a \"spirited\" establishment all rolled into one, that sums it up perfectly with their slogan: \"Keep Portland Weird.\" For some folks, it's a throwback to the good ol' days, the 90s and early 2000s, when Portland was a hidden gem, not overrun with fancy Californians and their shiny condos.  For others, it's an open invitation: come hang with us, we're weird here, and we mean it as a compliment.\n\nLook, even with all the fancy folks moving in and the construction boom, Portland still holds onto its weirdness. It's not about blindly accepting everything, mind you, but it's about embracing the unconventional. We've got our share of modern stuff, just like every other city – we even get most of our stuff from China. \n\nThere are tons of ways to be weird, to be anything but normal, but Portland has its fair share of normal folks too: yoga buffs, hipsters, business types. Maybe weirdness is just about taking things a little less seriously. \n\nTake my neighborhood, for example. We've got colorful houses, gardens bursting with flowers, herbs, and veggies, and something called \"free boxes\" popping up in the summer. These aren't your average cardboard boxes, though. They're treasure troves, filled with random stuff people are getting rid of – clothes, books, you name it. It's like a magical hunt for forgotten gems.  \n\nThat's the Portland vibe, at least to me. I'm just one weird dude among thousands. Some folks I know wouldn't dream of digging through a box on the sidewalk. They're more into goat yoga (yes, real goats!) or cheering on the Timbers, our local soccer team.\n\nPortland's a melting pot of passions. People chase their dreams, or at least dream about chasing them while enjoying a few too many drinks at the bar.\n\nSure, we have our problems, like drug issues, homelessness, and the ever-present drizzle. We're not immune to those struggles, just like any other city. But hey, it's all part of the Portland experience. We're weird, we're flawed, and we're trying to figure it all out, one free box at a time.",
            "The mountains, they're always there, man. Always watching over this town. Even when I'm bogged down with work and life, even when I forget about them, they're just sitting there, strong and silent. But on those days when I'm stressed to the max,  they seem to call to me. When I look up at them, they give me this sense of calm, like they're saying, \"Hey, you'll get through this, one step at a time.\"  I first saw them when I moved here for college. They were the first thing that really blew me away. Sure, the campus is pretty with its buildings, ponds, and trees, but those mountains, they're the real deal. The rest of the town is cool too, you know? There are tons of cafes where I spent countless hours fueled by caffeine and studying. And if you head downtown, it's like stepping back in time with all the old brick buildings.  It's surprisingly vibrant for a small town.  But just a short walk away, you're back in that peaceful small-town vibe.  It's this crazy mix of energy and chill that makes this place so special.  It's easy to make memories here, good and bad. I've had some epic nights with friends in the park after pulling all-nighters, and there are those times when I've just needed to sit by the pond and let it all out. You know, those existential crises that hit in the middle of the night.  Watching the turtles and ducks, I'd wonder about my place in the world.  One day, I was walking through town, past the ponds and houses, and I found myself heading north. And there they were, my mountain buddies, standing tall against the sunrise. They were like a silent reminder to keep going, to persevere. They're always there, you know?",
            "Okay, so you're thinking of checking out Bensonhurst, Brooklyn? Easy peasy! Getting there's a breeze thanks to the city's awesome public transport. You'll feel right at home here, it's textbook New York City vibes.  Get ready for a major dose of Asian culture – seriously, it's like every block has a shop run by Asian folks. Supermarkets and laundromats are everywhere, and trust me, they're the real deal. The food's top-notch, prices are killer, and let's be honest, convenience is king. Just a hop, skip, and a jump from where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within spitting distance of each other. Talk about grocery goals!\n\nNow, don't get me wrong, Bensonhurst isn't just an Asian enclave. It's a melting pot of cultures, with immigrants and their families making it a real mix.  While most of the big businesses are Asian-owned, there's also a recently revamped park nearby that's got something for everyone. Think basketball courts, soccer fields, handball courts, swings, a playground, and even a water fountain to keep the little ones happy.  It's the classic New York City park experience – tons of diversity, everyone just chilling and getting along.\n\nForget those towering corporate buildings – you'll mostly find co-ops, condos, and two-family houses here. The people are generally nice, though they can be a bit loud.  Expect your daily dose of car horns and engines revving up, especially in the mornings.\n\nAs for safety, Bensonhurst is pretty chill during the day, but you gotta watch your back at night. Like any city, there's always a chance you might encounter some troublemakers, bullies, or even thieves. I've had my share of run-ins in the past, but that was ages ago. Lately, package theft has been a bit of an issue. And let's not forget the ever-present dog mess – despite the city's rules, people seem to forget about picking up after their furry friends. You'll be dodging poop more often than not! \n\nJust keep your wits about you, watch your step, and you'll be golden!",
            "My neighborhood is a bit of a different world.  The streets are all uphill, with my house perched right at the top of the steepest incline.  They call it \"workout hill\" because it's a favorite spot for joggers.  There aren't any sidewalks, so everyone walks right on the road which is a bit bumpy and rough in places.  The power lines look kinda haphazard because they get knocked down by branches and storms all the time. We get loads of rain and wind here. The area's choked with tall evergreen trees, but people here aren't fans. They try to chop them down as much as possible because they block the ocean view.  That's why a lot of houses are built way up high, with huge, glassy second floors jutting out to capture the vista.\n\nSunsets are breathtaking, with the water glowing below and the sky turning fiery orange. But most days are cloudy and hazy, so you don't get to see a lot of sun.  Everything gets covered in moss – roofs, cars, even railings. Once I left my car parked for a month and it grew this whole green, fuzzy coat of moss. Took ages to scrub it off!\n\nThere aren't many kids around, though there's a school not too far away. Mostly, it's older folks, many of them retired.  Instead of kids, people have dogs. You see them everywhere, hanging out in lawns or chasing each other down the street. They're pretty brazen and might even sneak into your house if you leave a door or window open. I found one chilling in my living room once, had to politely escort it back outside!\n\nRabbits roam everywhere, some pretty big ones. Gardeners hate them because they dig up plants and burrow in lawns. My cats, though, love them and have pretty much wiped them out around our place. We also have the usual birds – sparrows, hummingbirds, and sometimes even hawks or eagles, until the crows chase them away.\n\nThere aren't any shops nearby, but if you head down to the waterfront, there are a few restaurants serving up fresh seafood. The beach isn't much to write home about, but the rocks along the shore are fun to toss into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide, so you can see the other side even on misty days.",
            "My neighborhood's pretty typical - a quiet suburban street in a small Tennessee town, smack-dab between two state highways. That means we get more traffic than I'd prefer, but other than that, it's chill. Folks here tend to stick around, so I've gotten to know most of the neighbors.  Life's mostly about yards, chores, and the usual neighbourhood grind. In winter, we turn our side street into a sledding hill.  Living at the corner, we practically have a front-row seat to everyone's comings and goings. We know whose car is whose, so any strange vehicle catches our eye.  Some folks walk for exercise or to walk their dogs, kids cruise around on bikes, you know, the usual.\n\nWe work from home, my wife and I, with our two daughters, eleven and fourteen.  We're pretty much homebodies, so everyone's used to seeing us around. We're out playing in the yard, even in the rain sometimes. We fire up the grill on the back deck occasionally, and the smell of barbecue just makes it feel extra cozy.  I swear, there's always someone mowing their lawn around here, from March to October when the grass finally decides to chill. We've got tons of trees, the neighborhood used to be all woods, so there's plenty of shade, but come autumn, it's a leaf-raking extravaganza.  I kinda love the smell of burning leaves, though, so that's a nice reminder that Fall's here.  We haven't had much of a winter lately, just feels like a super long Fall.  Our garage is at the back, so we hardly ever use the front door unless someone's knocking. I tinker with my truck and other projects in there, and with the doors open, it feels like I'm more in tune with the neighborhood. Holidays are pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving brings some out-of-town folks and an explosion of cars, same with Mother's Day and Christmas. Overall, it's a pretty sweet spot to live.  If it weren't for the traffic, it'd be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is smack-dab in the middle of the high desert, a land of dirt, dirt, and more dirt. Unless you've lived here, you can't truly grasp the feeling of constantly seeing brown.  When you do spot a lush lawn, you know that homeowner is shelling out big bucks for upkeep. Back in the 90s when I first moved here, houses were spread out like stars in the night sky. Now it's still pretty spread out, but there are a ton more houses popping up.  Honestly, it's starting to feel more and more like a city every day, though I guess that's happening everywhere.\n\nMost folks around here are super friendly, just like in any city, there are good parts and not-so-good parts.  My neighborhood is surrounded by friendly older folks, so I guess you could say it's a pretty decent place to live.\n\nWhen it comes to shopping, we're mostly stuck with chain stores like Food4Less and Smart & Final.  If you're craving something upscale, you've got to hit the road. I rarely see any Whole Foods or similar stores around here. \n\nBased on what I see, construction seems to be the biggest industry in town. I think that's because our city is still growing, with tons of open space ready for development. It kind of freaks me out, though. I like things the way they are now.  I left a big city and don't have any desire to go back.\n\nSpeaking of construction, that's what I do for a living. I'm a drywall and T-bar installer.\n\nWhat I love most about my home is the wildlife. People flock to the high desert for its stark beauty, and that includes the unique ecosystems that exist here. It's important for us who live here to learn about the animals who share this environment so we can coexist peacefully. My family and I have definitely gotten used to sharing our space with the locals. My three kids are obsessed with lizards and desert bugs. Right now, they're outside catching all sorts of critters.\n\nWhen it comes to attractions, we've got a few. Victorville is a great place for families who want to experience the desert firsthand. If you're planning a visit, try to time it with the San Bernardino County Fair – a fun event with plenty to see and do. And if you're feeling adventurous, head over to nearby Wrightwood for some snow sports in the winter.\n\nHistory buffs will appreciate the Victor Valley Museum, which houses geological and paleontological finds, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of Victorville's growth.",
            "So, when people ask me about my neighborhood, things get a little weird. You know, the usual homeowners with their backyards and barbecues? Not my scene. My neighborhood is the college campus, my dorm is my home base, and the people who live there with me are my crew.  Sure, the surrounding campus is part of it too, but my dorm life is where it's at.  \n\nBut hey, even though it's a little different, my neighborhood still has the basics.  There are \"houses\" - apartments, regular houses, and dorm buildings - just like anywhere else.  Apartments usually have a few people per room, maybe 20 in a whole building.  Then there are the houses, mostly for alumni, but they're spread out. And of course, the dorms, packed with hundreds of students, two to a room, that's where most of us live. \n\nThe people here are another story.  My school is all about diversity, so my neighborhood is a melting pot of cultures and ages.  Professors tend to live in the houses, younger students are in the dorms, and the older ones? Apartments for them. It's a vibrant mix!\n\nAnd just like any neighborhood, we've got stores and a park.  We've got all the usual spots to grab a bite, plus school-specific stores for clothes and groceries.  Everything you need is right here!  The park is our spot to chill, always clean and safe because we all look out for each other.",
            "So, I've been here for about 10 years now, so I guess I can share some stories about my time in this neighborhood. When I first moved here from Riverdale to Stockbridge, I have to admit, I was pretty bummed. I missed my old place and the people there. But my parents wanted what was best for me and my little sister – a better house, a better school, you know, a \"not ghetto\" kind of vibe. It took some time to adjust, but I made some new friends and, yeah, a few enemies along the way. I never really got close to the neighbors, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis for a bit, since they lived right next door. They've been like family to me in a way, and I'm really grateful for them.\n\nI remember when my family went to Mr. Glen's wedding (they got remarried!). It was a blast – tons of dancing, good food, good company. It made me think about my own future, about finding someone special and giving them a life they deserve.  Speaking of the wedding, I actually caught the little white strap Mr. Glen's wife, Ms. Veda, threw! Sadly, I didn't catch the bouquet. I had a great time chatting with Marsharii, one of their daughters, but I haven't seen her since.  I hope she's doing well.\n\nThis neighborhood is like a maze, but now with GPS, I'm exploring more. I mostly stick to hanging out with my friends Kason and Curtis, especially when we're playing video games. We used to spend hours at it, just enjoying life. A lot of times I'd head to the park to relax and soak up some nature. It's so peaceful there.  Sometimes, I even practice my balance with some sticks I got from Home Depot, and maybe even bring along my bokken wooden sword for a little training. \n\nThere's also a basketball and tennis court, even though I haven't played either in a while.  It's nice to have them there just in case I feel like getting back into it. My dad and I used to play tennis with Mr. Graves all the time – he really pushed us, but it was always fun. \n\nLooking back, I've had so many good times in this neighborhood, but those are the ones that really stand out. I'm excited to see what the future holds!",
            "My pad's a stone's throw from my college, which is a major plus. It's mostly apartments around here, with a few decent, budget-friendly bars and eats thrown in.  One bar just got a fancy name change, and now it's a tad pricey, but the drinks and service aren't terrible.  The folks here are mostly chill – college kids or those on a tighter budget, since rents aren't exactly sky-high. There are tons of kids around 'cause there's an elementary school within spitting distance. Don't know my neighbors too well – kinda good that way. They're a bit...enthusiastic about their weed, so the building management put an air freshener right outside their door. Hilarious, yet kinda insulting, you know? \n\nThe buildings around here are mostly old-school looking, but some have been spruced up inside. There are some shiny new apartments down the street, but they scream \"cheap construction, inflated rent.\" They're basically cashing in on the college crowd.  Speaking of cheap eats, there's this place five minutes away that serves everything on paper plates – it's mostly microwaved stuff, but hey, it's cheap. Across the street is a gas station that supposedly has a horrible work environment. But thanks to some city dough, they redid the road last summer. Now there's a decent sidewalk, grassy medians, the whole nine yards. Makes the place feel a bit nicer.\n\nMy building is tucked away under a canopy of trees – they chopped down a few, leaving some gnarly stumps behind, but there are still plenty left. Behind my complex is a line of trees, then another set of apartments. I'm on 42nd street, but behind me is 43rd. Not as charming, let's just say that. Sidewalks are crumbling, buildings look rough around the edges, and there are more trees, probably to hide the shabbiness. Most of the crime around here seems to be concentrated in one complex on 43rd, but then again, another complex across the street has its share of issues too.  \n\nBut hey, I dig my spot. It's affordable, and it's got everything I need. Plus, the uni's a walk away, and there are two bus stops that get me to the shops and downtown in a flash.",
            "My neighborhood is like stepping back in time. It's made up of identical duplexes on a cul-de-sac, all painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. They're spaced out so they look like individual houses, and most of the neighbors know each other. We often gather at the end of driveways in the evenings, chatting while the kids play. It's a refreshing change from the constant hustle and bustle of the digital world.  \n\nWe're surrounded by fields and trees, with endless blue skies and fluffy clouds. It's pretty idyllic, but we've had some crazy weather lately. Tornado warnings have become common, and last night, we actually heard the sirens! I ended up in the bathtub with my smallest dog, my purse, and a few pillows, while my big dog stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The neighborhood was eerily quiet except for the sound of hail pummeling the ground.\n\nAfter the storm passed, the road was literally steaming from the temperature change. It went from 92 degrees to 75 in a flash! The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement. As the clouds cleared, a double rainbow appeared. I grabbed my camera and snapped some pictures to share with everyone. It was breathtaking.\n\nFor an hour after the storm, the neighborhood was deserted. Then, people started trickling back home. It was back to normal pretty quickly, with moms and kids outside again as dinner cooked. \n\nMy apartment is a two-bedroom, two-bath, just like everyone else's, though some of the apartments inside are surprisingly small. It's a friendly neighborhood, and I love the southern accents. I enjoy walking in the big field behind my place and strolling down to the pond (not for swimming, though!). I've even seen deer and heard the croaking of a giant bullfrog in the mornings. It's a fantastic place to live, just forty minutes outside Charlotte.\n\nEvery morning, we're woken up by the sound of roosters crowing from the nearby farms. It feels like living in a small village. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that brays in the evenings. I feel so lucky to have found this amazing neighborhood.",
            "Moving into this neighborhood right before eighth grade was a bit tough at first, friendship-wise. I eventually clicked with a couple of guys, one two houses down and another on my street. They've since moved away, but those memories stick with me. Most of the folks who were here when I first arrived are still around. It's pretty much your typical American suburb: loads of two-story houses, the sound of kids playing outside whenever the weather's good, and a generally quiet atmosphere most days. \n\nI haven't had any bad experiences with anyone here. You're left to your own devices unless you need something, and I've never had a package disappear from my porch. I feel pretty comfortable trusting my neighbors.\n\nThere's a park just a stone's throw away, packed with memories. We played basketball, football, and baseball there with the neighborhood crew. I even got clocked in the nose during a football game, which isn't my fondest memory, but the good times definitely outweigh the bad. These days, I mostly go there to hang out with my cousins' kids – they're still into swings, slides, and all that good stuff. Just the thought of the park gets them pumped. It brings back a lot of nostalgia for me.\n\nThe neighborhood's pretty diverse, with a whole bunch of different food options within walking distance. You can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants all within a mile. Of course, these days everyone's relying on apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for delivery. The usual suspects – fast food joints and pizza places – are plentiful, just like in any suburb.\n\nWe've got everything we need in terms of stores: dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, a Jewel-Osco grocery store (a Midwest favorite), and even an Indian-owned store for those craving homemade or ready-made Indian food. \n\nOverall, I love my neighborhood. Reading about other people's crazy neighbor stories online and on the news makes me appreciate mine even more.",
            "My town, Johnston, is a typical South Carolina town - nothing fancy, but it plays a big role in the farming world. It's known as the Peach Capital of the World, a title it proudly flaunts on its welcome sign.  Everywhere you look, it's either peach orchards or cattle farms. Houses outside the main part of town are spread out, mostly two-story homes with metal roofs to beat the summer heat or gray shingles. They're usually tucked away from the road, leaving space for fields in front.\n\nDowntown, you'll find a single traffic light where everything else hangs out. There are just a few stores in town:  Hong Kong, a small Chinese place run by a family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a local burger chain. A pizzeria used to be there but closed recently. There's also Maxwell and Halford Drug, a tiny family pharmacy famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola. The only grocery store is Independent Grocers Alliance (IGA), but it's pricey and most people head to a Walmart in the next town for their shopping.  Dollar General is the most popular spot, though. It's always packed with folks grabbing everyday essentials.\n\nThere's also a friendly furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a local favorite. It's been around forever and even has movers to deliver your new couch! Attached to the furniture store is Clark's Cuts and Kennels for all your pet grooming needs.\n\nThe doctor and vet's offices are further out from the main area, but they're well-equipped. There's only one elementary school, Johnston Elementary, but kids have to go to the next town for middle and high school.  \n\nWe're working on a 2.5-acre park, but right now, there aren't many places to hang out.  No movie theaters, bowling alleys, playgrounds, or even a specific dog park. It's a quiet town, easy to miss if you blink!",
            "So, the first time I heard about my building, I was listening to a podcast about missing persons. It was a bit of a surprise, considering how expensive this place is - every apartment here is over a thousand dollars a month! None of my friends had ever heard of any stories like that either. Maybe it's the struggle, you know? I know a few friends who cry themselves to sleep at night because things are so expensive. But we've learned to be frugal, to find joy in the dusty charm of flea market finds and vintage clothes. You kind of lose your sense of smell as you get older, or maybe you just get used to the way things are. But that flea market vibe, it always sticks around. It's the smell of old magazines piled on a dusty piano, clinging to your worn leather jacket even after you've washed it. There are three thrift stores within walking distance of my place. If you start at one end, you can hit up two charity shops, a library, a rare book store, and a quirky little curio shop. Downtown is packed with cars and people every morning, but inside those thrift stores, it's always eerily quiet. No matter how busy the streets are, the stores are sanctuaries of calm, perfect for escaping for an afternoon. Every year, there are more and more buildings going up, more cars and people flooding the streets. It's a growing city, they say, with one of the biggest online empires for e-commerce and delivery. It's still figuring things out, like a teenager going through awkward phases. It reminds me of New York, actually. Everyone's focused on their own thing, and nobody really expects you to do much more than stay out of their way. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people won't bat an eye. It's not like the South, where showing a little bit of concern is considered caring. Nobody really pries into your life here. You can keep your walls up as high as you want, and the city will just keep rolling on, like waves crashing on the beach. It's a lively place, for sure. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur singers upstairs, there's always something going on. I guess we're more of a community than just a bunch of strangers living in the same building. We come together for birthdays, funerals, to help each other out. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. We look out for each other, share food, help with errands. It's nice to see familiar faces, and I think they enjoy my company as much as I enjoy theirs. I live in this massive, impersonal concrete jungle, but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I haven't completely screwed up my life.",
            "This place I live in? Picture your standard, cookie-cutter suburb.  Seriously, it's like they used a template. You can practically thank the homeowner's association for the perfectly manicured lawns and identical front yards –  a little patch of grass, some pebbles, and driveways that are way too short. Every now and then you'll spot a sad little tree trying to make its way. Everyone's got a two-car garage, and the roads are like something out of a dream, all freshly paved with nary a pothole in sight. Most houses are single-story, but sometimes you'll stumble across a two-story one, breaking the monotony.  \n\nBut forget about those individual mailboxes you see everywhere else. Nope, here it's all communal. Big clusters of mailboxes at the end of the street, accessed with a key, and two massive lockers for packages. Gotta love the HOA's obsession with, well, everything being the same.\n\nMy house sits on the fringe of the city, so it's a bit of a weird mix – part rural, part suburbia.  We've got tons of space, which is cool. There are community pools (gated and fancy, of course), walking trails for your dog or your existential crisis, and enough space to run around and get your workout in.\n\nMostly, it's populated by retirees, which makes it super safe and everyone's always looking out for each other.  There are a few middle-aged and younger folks like me thrown in for good measure.\n\nThe city itself is a beast, surprisingly populous but still feeling like a small town. It has everything you need – one mall, which isn't huge but gets the job done. A 15-minute drive takes you to a world of shopping: organic grocery stores, bargain bins with staff who look like they'd rather be anywhere else... you name it.\n\nSo, yeah, my neighborhood is safe, clean, and pretty standard. It's nice, we've got amenities, and we're not too far from the action.",
            "I call my hometown a small Midwestern town, just outside the suburbs of a big city. The part of town I live in, on the east side, is the poorest. Houses are mostly rented or owned by folks who struggle financially, and property values are low. But it's not a bad place to be. My neighbors are friendly folks who always wave hello when I'm out walking. Sure, crime rates are a tad higher than other areas, but they're still pretty low overall. There have been a few violent incidents in the past ten years, a few shootings and even a homicide, all within a few blocks of my house. Last year, the family next door lost their son in a shooting outside a bar. Thankfully, our family has been lucky enough to avoid anything serious – just the occasional missing item from the porch if we forget to bring it inside.\n\nThis town, like many places, has been hit hard by the opioid crisis. Too many lives have been lost to fentanyl overdoses.  But there are good things happening too. We have several addiction recovery centers and Narcan training programs for families and friends impacted by this epidemic.\n\nDespite the challenges, there are a lot of good things about this town. My son's elementary school is amazing. From the principal to the teachers and support staff, everyone is dedicated. He's actually thrived there, even with his special needs, because the atmosphere is so positive. There’s a very active PTO that organizes events throughout the year to keep families involved and learning fun.\n\nBecause over 20% of our town lives below the poverty line, the school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students. No one feels less than because of their financial situation, and school fees, supplies, and field trips are affordable.\n\nThe City Council has made some improvements to the town, like fixing roads, planting trees, and sprucing up parks. Most of these upgrades are in the center of town and on the west side, where the shops and traffic are. The east side, where I live, tends to get overlooked, which is frustrating for us.\n\nOverall, I'm happy living here. People are friendly, the schools are great, there are plenty of stores, and our house might not be worth much, but it’s comfortable and homey. We’ve lived here for over 16 years, and I can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is bursting with character. It's perched on a hill, surrounded by buildings steeped in history. I live in a seven-story apartment building directly across from an old theater, and just a block down is a quirky arcade bar that draws all sorts of folks on warm summer nights. Especially during June and July, weekends often see a line snaking out the door. A few blocks up is the nearest city park, surprisingly spacious for its location. The park is enclosed by concrete, with steep steps built right into the wall. When winter hits, you'll see homeless folks setting up neat rows of tents along the sidewalk and those wide steps. It doesn't snow much here, but the heavy downpours that come in mid-winter make it tough to stay warm. Clustering together in the heart of town instead of out in the wilderness keeps them warmer, plus they're within easy reach of the only family center for miles, where they can shower and freshen up.\n\nBut what I truly love about this city isn't the historical charm – the majestic buildings, the architecture that climbs up the rolling hills towards the ocean. It's the people that make this neighborhood special. \n\nHilltop used to be notorious on the West Coast for gang violence. Even three decades later, you hear whispers of federal agents and the DEA swooping in, trying to clean up the streets.  The stories linger, passed down through generations, reaching even newcomers like me. These folks work hard, even though Hilltop is still considered one of the tougher neighborhoods, to keep things clean and safe. They take pride in their city, their block. You'll hear warnings about not walking around the Hill after dark if you're white – a relic of the past, tinged with the sting of prejudice. Maybe it's because I'm dark-skinned enough to blend in, or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of their own, someone who understands the constant reminders of racism, cultural bias, and assumptions based on ignorance and fear. Even in a city that claims to be a melting pot of cultures. \n\nOne thing's for sure: no matter where I go, Hilltop will always feel like home. The streets hum with life, and I've experienced more kindness than any other place.  People have offered me a jacket in the cold, opened their laundromats late so I could charge my phone in the rain, and even stopped to tell me I'm beautiful and valuable on the dreariest of nights.",
            "I live in a small town in rural Michigan, where farmlands give way to charming tourist spots. There's no bustling city life here – no big malls, chain stores like Walmart or Target, or even a familiar spot like Applebee's. You need a car to get anywhere you want to go.  Despite the lack of big-city amenities, I live in a truly beautiful place surrounded by water. My town is nestled between two stunning lakes – Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other.  Every direction you look, there's a beach within reach.\n\nMy neighborhood embodies the classic small-town feel. Houses aren't crammed together like in a city; they're spread out, each with its own unique character.  Some are older, with a touch of vintage charm, while others have been updated and modernized.  Many even have full basements visible from the street.  You'll find a rainbow of colors on the houses lining the blocks, with most boasting yards filled with trampolines, playsets, gardens, and even fences for animals. It's a picture-perfect representation of Middle America: hardworking families making a living, raising kids, and creating a sense of community.\n\nKids run freely down the streets, while you might also see people walking their dogs, biking, or rollerblading.  Everyone seems to know each other, and you can easily tell who belongs and who's just passing through. A friendly wave from someone grilling outside or a pleasant smile from a neighbor walking their dog a few blocks away is a common occurrence. Lawns are well-maintained, free of piles of leaves, with freshly mowed grass and neatly trimmed bushes.\n\nThis isn't a neighborhood that screams \"luxury,\" but it's the kind of place that makes you think, \"This would be a great place to raise a family.\" It's quiet, peaceful, and safe. While not outwardly glamorous, it embodies the essence of what people crave: a secure and welcoming place to call home.  \n\nWithin walking distance, you'll find the county sheriff's department, the jail, the health department, and the recycling center, all conveniently located and serving the needs of the community. Nearby baseball and softball fields echo with the excitement of games, and the rumble of small planes taking off and landing at our local airport adds a touch of charm to the daily soundtrack.  A short walk takes you to the local ice cream shop, and if you're feeling adventurous, you can even bike or walk downtown. My kids can easily ride their bikes to the park, just eight blocks away.\n\nThis small town is truly a great place to live."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "My city's a real melting pot, a crazy mix of everything. Residential areas pop up everywhere, kinda randomly tucked between shops and offices. You've got your big chains, sure, but there's also tons of cool, independent boutiques popping up on every street corner. It's like a constant exploration, even just walking around. Oh, and don't even get me started on the food! New restaurants are opening left and right, there's always something new to try.  Plus, there are a couple of parks nearby, always packed with families and kids.\n\nSpeaking of diversity, man, this place is wild. You've got your LGBTQ+ community, Orthodox Jews, even a whole bunch of folks who've resettled from the former Soviet Union, all in one small spot. And if you venture a little further out, you've got your \"Chinatown,\" \"Koreatown,\" \"Little Armenia\" - it's like a mini-United Nations out there.  \n\nThe thing is, getting around can be a nightmare. Everyone drives, so traffic is insane, especially during rush hour.  It's a 10-mile drive, but it can easily turn into a two-hour commute.  Even though lots of cool stuff is close by, it feels like everything is spread out forever.  \n\nThey're building tons of apartment buildings, trying to keep up with everyone moving in, but it feels like things are getting more crowded every day. More people, more cars, it's a recipe for disaster.  \n\nBut hey, there's still some variety in the types of places people live. You've got your typical apartment buildings, sure, but also houses, duplexes, little condo complexes -  it's not all concrete jungle.  And the people? Well, it's a mix of ages, and honestly, I don't know most of my neighbors. Not like it used to be when I was a kid, hanging out with the other kids on the block. It's different now, but hey, that's life in the big city, right?",
            "My neighborhood's kinda unique. Most houses are single-family, but some have been split into two, still connected though, you know? My place has a small yard out front and a tiny driveway on the side. It's got that classic suburban vibe, like a snapshot of the American Dream from not too long ago. It used to feel like everyone was chasing that dream, but now it seems like it's pulling away from some folks. \n\nBut still, our neighborhood holds onto it, whispers that the dream's still alive. People aren't as optimistic as they used to be, the yards aren't kept up like they used to be, but there's still a car or two in every driveway, and the kids are out playing like the world's their playground. The old public school, almost 90 years young, still stands, promising a future to the kids and a blast from the past for the older folks. Churches are sparse, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are always packed. \n\nEvery house looks different, but there’s a familiar feeling in them all. There's a big supermarket called Super \"A\", owned by a huge Yemeni family, probably the only Arab family around.

There used to be a karate school, but when Hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids lost interest. Now it's a pharmacy, 'cause apparently, drugs fix everything. \n\nThere's also a small movie theatre showing old films for cheap, ignored by the kids who want the latest releases, but loved by the elders who don't mind a night out without the kids. And there's this single expressway that cuts through town, even though the entrance and exit are in the next town over. Years ago, they tried to get an exit for our town, but the elders said it would ruin everything, and they convinced the city council to say no. \n\nNow they're building a new high school, and we're trying to pick a mascot.  I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the perfect symbol for my town.",
            "You might not notice it at first glance. It's tucked away behind a strip mall, not the kind of place you'd expect to find a community. But if you venture behind the old, boarded-up Whole Foods and past the hotels that are mostly empty except for a few summer weeks filled with family reunions, you'll discover a thriving neighborhood.  These communities are hidden along the road, with apartment complexes lining up beside each other like carefully disassembled Russian nesting dolls. The first complex you'll come across has been in the news for some not-so-nice things, so we'll skip over those. But the complexes next door, and the ones after that, are a whole different story, a secret known only to a few. Across from them sits a quiet branch of a community college.  Students stroll in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 a.m., starting their day. The iron gates creak open to let them in, while commuters grumble and shake their fists at the traffic delays on busier days. The road takes a turn, leading to another residential street, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for those recovering from injuries on the other. The center has cheerful porch furniture and a ceiling fan that lazily stirs the warm summer air. Kids play in the park, cartwheeling and running through the tall grass while bees buzz around the flower beds.  Older folks walk their dogs, eyeing the teenagers skateboarding and nodding politely at the girls huddled by the playground, gossiping about boys and the latest online trends.  There's a sushi place in a nearby strip mall with cheap eats, a swimming supply store right next to it, and a nail salon tucked in between. You could easily spend an afternoon getting a manicure, grabbing lunch, and stocking up on pool supplies all in one place. There's even a self-serve frozen yogurt shop where teens often congregate, slurping down their cold treats while skateboarding and vaping.

            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove past fields of corn stretching out as far as the eye could see. I knew she'd be surprised by how empty and open the landscape was. She was from a town where you could walk to the grocery store in five minutes—she'd never seen anything like this before. Overwhelmed by the endless cornfields, I told her about growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood who I was and where I came from.\n\nWe continued down a two-lane country road until we reached a quarry filled with water. Just past it was a small development where I live. The houses were mostly made of brick and stucco, each with at least half an acre of land that everyone took pride in keeping up. In the spring, the yards burst with colorful flowers, alongside the midwestern trees that changed colors with the seasons.  The driveways were lined with shiny, high-end Mercedes-Benz cars that gleamed in the afternoon sun after a good wash.\n\nAs we drove towards my grey stucco house, my Korean neighbor was outside, as always, with a friendly smile. He spent the whole day mowing his lawn, his singing voice carrying over the hum of the mower. Everyone in the neighborhood found it amusing, but he was a genuine, amazing guy with a fascinating past. He was a doctor once, and though he's gotten older and a little slower, he still blends right in with his John Deere mower.\n\nFinally, we reached my house. In the side yard, geese honked loudly and were chased around by our terrier.  Behind the house was a small stream that flowed into the quarry.  We could hear the bullfrogs, the gurgling stream, and the occasional \"moo\" from the nearby farms. A handmade wooden bridge crossed the stream, leading to a secluded spot filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was my childhood haven.  I built tree forts there and \"hunted\" (mostly chasing) animals, always finding something to do with a neighborhood friend by my side.\n\nThe winters in my small town could be brutal, but they were also beautiful. The yard transformed from a lush green into a stark wilderness. Trees that once bloomed with pink, purple, and orange flowers stood bare, their branches like skeletons against the sky. But when it snowed, a winter wonderland appeared overnight. The backyard was covered with snow angels made by my little sister and snowmen. We fought constantly as kids, and during winter, snowballs were our weapons of choice. We built massive igloo-like forts to store our branches-and-rock arsenal. In our own winter wonderland, we played pretend, forgetting about everything else. We were just carefree kids.",
            "Alright, so you wanna know about Portland, Oregon? Well, \"weird\" is the name of the game here.  There's this one place, a pizza joint, bar, music venue, and, let's just say, a \"spirited\" establishment all rolled into one, that sums it up perfectly with their slogan: \"Keep Portland Weird.\" For some folks, it's a throwback to the good ol' days, the 90s and early 2000s, when Portland was a hidden gem, not overrun with fancy Californians and their shiny condos.  For others, it's an open invitation: come hang with us, we're weird here, and we mean it as a compliment.\n\nLook, even with all the fancy folks moving in and the construction boom, Portland still holds onto its weirdness. It's not about blindly accepting everything, mind you, but it's about embracing the unconventional. We've got our share of modern stuff, just like every other city – we even get most of our stuff from China. \n\nThere are tons of ways to be weird, to be anything but normal, but Portland has its fair share of normal folks too: yoga buffs, hipsters, business types. Maybe weirdness is just about taking things a little less seriously. \n\nTake my neighborhood, for example. We've got colorful houses, gardens bursting with flowers, herbs, and veggies, and something called \"free boxes\" popping up in the summer. These aren't your average cardboard boxes, though. They're treasure troves, filled with random stuff people are getting rid of – clothes, books, you name it. It's like a magical hunt for forgotten gems.  \n\nThat's the Portland vibe, at least to me. I'm just one weird dude among thousands. Some folks I know wouldn't dream of digging through a box on the sidewalk. They're more into goat yoga (yes, real goats!) or cheering on the Timbers, our local soccer team.\n\nPortland's a melting pot of passions. People chase their dreams, or at least dream about chasing them while enjoying a few too many drinks at the bar.\n\nSure, we have our problems, like drug issues, homelessness, and the ever-present drizzle. We're not immune to those struggles, just like any other city. But hey, it's all part of the Portland experience. We're weird, we're flawed, and we're trying to figure it all out, one free box at a time.",
            "The mountains, they're always there, man. Always watching over this town. Even when I'm bogged down with work and life, even when I forget about them, they're just sitting there, strong and silent. But on those days when I'm stressed to the max,  they seem to call to me. When I look up at them, they give me this sense of calm, like they're saying, \"Hey, you'll get through this, one step at a time.\"  I first saw them when I moved here for college. They were the first thing that really blew me away. Sure, the campus is pretty with its buildings, ponds, and trees, but those mountains, they're the real deal. The rest of the town is cool too, you know? There are tons of cafes where I spent countless hours fueled by caffeine and studying. And if you head downtown, it's like stepping back in time with all the old brick buildings.  It's surprisingly vibrant for a small town.  But just a short walk away, you're back in that peaceful small-town vibe.  It's this crazy mix of energy and chill that makes this place so special.  It's easy to make memories here, good and bad. I've had some epic nights with friends in the park after pulling all-nighters, and there are those times when I've just needed to sit by the pond and let it all out. You know, those existential crises that hit in the middle of the night.  Watching the turtles and ducks, I'd wonder about my place in the world.  One day, I was walking through town, past the ponds and houses, and I found myself heading north. And there they were, my mountain buddies, standing tall against the sunrise. They were like a silent reminder to keep going, to persevere. They're always there, you know?",
            "Okay, so you're thinking of checking out Bensonhurst, Brooklyn? Easy peasy! Getting there's a breeze thanks to the city's awesome public transport. You'll feel right at home here, it's textbook New York City vibes.  Get ready for a major dose of Asian culture – seriously, it's like every block has a shop run by Asian folks. Supermarkets and laundromats are everywhere, and trust me, they're the real deal. The food's top-notch, prices are killer, and let's be honest, convenience is king. Just a hop, skip, and a jump from where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within spitting distance of each other. Talk about grocery goals!\n\nNow, don't get me wrong, Bensonhurst isn't just an Asian enclave. It's a melting pot of cultures, with immigrants and their families making it a real mix.  While most of the big businesses are Asian-owned, there's also a recently revamped park nearby that's got something for everyone. Think basketball courts, soccer fields, handball courts, swings, a playground, and even a water fountain to keep the little ones happy.  It's the classic New York City park experience – tons of diversity, everyone just chilling and getting along.\n\nForget those towering corporate buildings – you'll mostly find co-ops, condos, and two-family houses here. The people are generally nice, though they can be a bit loud.  Expect your daily dose of car horns and engines revving up, especially in the mornings.\n\nAs for safety, Bensonhurst is pretty chill during the day, but you gotta watch your back at night. Like any city, there's always a chance you might encounter some troublemakers, bullies, or even thieves. I've had my share of run-ins in the past, but that was ages ago. Lately, package theft has been a bit of an issue. And let's not forget the ever-present dog mess – despite the city's rules, people seem to forget about picking up after their furry friends. You'll be dodging poop more often than not! \n\nJust keep your wits about you, watch your step, and you'll be golden!",
            "My neighborhood is a bit of a different world.  The streets are all uphill, with my house perched right at the top of the steepest incline.  They call it \"workout hill\" because it's a favorite spot for joggers.  There aren't any sidewalks, so everyone walks right on the road which is a bit bumpy and rough in places.  The power lines look kinda haphazard because they get knocked down by branches and storms all the time. We get loads of rain and wind here. The area's choked with tall evergreen trees, but people here aren't fans. They try to chop them down as much as possible because they block the ocean view.  That's why a lot of houses are built way up high, with huge, glassy second floors jutting out to capture the vista.\n\nSunsets are breathtaking, with the water glowing below and the sky turning fiery orange. But most days are cloudy and hazy, so you don't get to see a lot of sun.  Everything gets covered in moss – roofs, cars, even railings. Once I left my car parked for a month and it grew this whole green, fuzzy coat of moss. Took ages to scrub it off!\n\nThere aren't many kids around, though there's a school not too far away. Mostly, it's older folks, many of them retired.  Instead of kids, people have dogs. You see them everywhere, hanging out in lawns or chasing each other down the street. They're pretty brazen and might even sneak into your house if you leave a door or window open. I found one chilling in my living room once, had to politely escort it back outside!\n\nRabbits roam everywhere, some pretty big ones. Gardeners hate them because they dig up plants and burrow in lawns. My cats, though, love them and have pretty much wiped them out around our place. We also have the usual birds – sparrows, hummingbirds, and sometimes even hawks or eagles, until the crows chase them away.\n\nThere aren't any shops nearby, but if you head down to the waterfront, there are a few restaurants serving up fresh seafood. The beach isn't much to write home about, but the rocks along the shore are fun to toss into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide, so you can see the other side even on misty days.",
            "My neighborhood's pretty typical - a quiet suburban street in a small Tennessee town, smack-dab between two state highways. That means we get more traffic than I'd prefer, but other than that, it's chill. Folks here tend to stick around, so I've gotten to know most of the neighbors.  Life's mostly about yards, chores, and the usual neighbourhood grind. In winter, we turn our side street into a sledding hill.  Living at the corner, we practically have a front-row seat to everyone's comings and goings. We know whose car is whose, so any strange vehicle catches our eye.  Some folks walk for exercise or to walk their dogs, kids cruise around on bikes, you know, the usual.\n\nWe work from home, my wife and I, with our two daughters, eleven and fourteen.  We're pretty much homebodies, so everyone's used to seeing us around. We're out playing in the yard, even in the rain sometimes. We fire up the grill on the back deck occasionally, and the smell of barbecue just makes it feel extra cozy.  I swear, there's always someone mowing their lawn around here, from March to October when the grass finally decides to chill. We've got tons of trees, the neighborhood used to be all woods, so there's plenty of shade, but come autumn, it's a leaf-raking extravaganza.  I kinda love the smell of burning leaves, though, so that's a nice reminder that Fall's here.  We haven't had much of a winter lately, just feels like a super long Fall.  Our garage is at the back, so we hardly ever use the front door unless someone's knocking. I tinker with my truck and other projects in there, and with the doors open, it feels like I'm more in tune with the neighborhood. Holidays are pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving brings some out-of-town folks and an explosion of cars, same with Mother's Day and Christmas. Overall, it's a pretty sweet spot to live.  If it weren't for the traffic, it'd be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is smack-dab in the middle of the high desert, a land of dirt, dirt, and more dirt. Unless you've lived here, you can't truly grasp the feeling of constantly seeing brown.  When you do spot a lush lawn, you know that homeowner is shelling out big bucks for upkeep. Back in the 90s when I first moved here, houses were spread out like stars in the night sky. Now it's still pretty spread out, but there are a ton more houses popping up.  Honestly, it's starting to feel more and more like a city every day, though I guess that's happening everywhere.\n\nMost folks around here are super friendly, just like in any city, there are good parts and not-so-good parts.  My neighborhood is surrounded by friendly older folks, so I guess you could say it's a pretty decent place to live.\n\nWhen it comes to shopping, we're mostly stuck with chain stores like Food4Less and Smart & Final.  If you're craving something upscale, you've got to hit the road. I rarely see any Whole Foods or similar stores around here. \n\nBased on what I see, construction seems to be the biggest industry in town. I think that's because our city is still growing, with tons of open space ready for development. It kind of freaks me out, though. I like things the way they are now.  I left a big city and don't have any desire to go back.\n\nSpeaking of construction, that's what I do for a living. I'm a drywall and T-bar installer.\n\nWhat I love most about my home is the wildlife. People flock to the high desert for its stark beauty, and that includes the unique ecosystems that exist here. It's important for us who live here to learn about the animals who share this environment so we can coexist peacefully. My family and I have definitely gotten used to sharing our space with the locals. My three kids are obsessed with lizards and desert bugs. Right now, they're outside catching all sorts of critters.\n\nWhen it comes to attractions, we've got a few. Victorville is a great place for families who want to experience the desert firsthand. If you're planning a visit, try to time it with the San Bernardino County Fair – a fun event with plenty to see and do. And if you're feeling adventurous, head over to nearby Wrightwood for some snow sports in the winter.\n\nHistory buffs will appreciate the Victor Valley Museum, which houses geological and paleontological finds, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of Victorville's growth.",
            "So, when people ask me about my neighborhood, things get a little weird. You know, the usual homeowners with their backyards and barbecues? Not my scene. My neighborhood is the college campus, my dorm is my home base, and the people who live there with me are my crew.  Sure, the surrounding campus is part of it too, but my dorm life is where it's at.  \n\nBut hey, even though it's a little different, my neighborhood still has the basics.  There are \"houses\" - apartments, regular houses, and dorm buildings - just like anywhere else.  Apartments usually have a few people per room, maybe 20 in a whole building.  Then there are the houses, mostly for alumni, but they're spread out. And of course, the dorms, packed with hundreds of students, two to a room, that's where most of us live. \n\nThe people here are another story.  My school is all about diversity, so my neighborhood is a melting pot of cultures and ages.  Professors tend to live in the houses, younger students are in the dorms, and the older ones? Apartments for them. It's a vibrant mix!\n\nAnd just like any neighborhood, we've got stores and a park.  We've got all the usual spots to grab a bite, plus school-specific stores for clothes and groceries.  Everything you need is right here!  The park is our spot to chill, always clean and safe because we all look out for each other.",
            "So, I've been here for about 10 years now, so I guess I can share some stories about my time in this neighborhood. When I first moved here from Riverdale to Stockbridge, I have to admit, I was pretty bummed. I missed my old place and the people there. But my parents wanted what was best for me and my little sister – a better house, a better school, you know, a \"not ghetto\" kind of vibe. It took some time to adjust, but I made some new friends and, yeah, a few enemies along the way. I never really got close to the neighbors, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis for a bit, since they lived right next door. They've been like family to me in a way, and I'm really grateful for them.\n\nI remember when my family went to Mr. Glen's wedding (they got remarried!). It was a blast – tons of dancing, good food, good company. It made me think about my own future, about finding someone special and giving them a life they deserve.  Speaking of the wedding, I actually caught the little white strap Mr. Glen's wife, Ms. Veda, threw! Sadly, I didn't catch the bouquet. I had a great time chatting with Marsharii, one of their daughters, but I haven't seen her since.  I hope she's doing well.\n\nThis neighborhood is like a maze, but now with GPS, I'm exploring more. I mostly stick to hanging out with my friends Kason and Curtis, especially when we're playing video games. We used to spend hours at it, just enjoying life. A lot of times I'd head to the park to relax and soak up some nature. It's so peaceful there.  Sometimes, I even practice my balance with some sticks I got from Home Depot, and maybe even bring along my bokken wooden sword for a little training. \n\nThere's also a basketball and tennis court, even though I haven't played either in a while.  It's nice to have them there just in case I feel like getting back into it. My dad and I used to play tennis with Mr. Graves all the time – he really pushed us, but it was always fun. \n\nLooking back, I've had so many good times in this neighborhood, but those are the ones that really stand out. I'm excited to see what the future holds!",
            "My pad's a stone's throw from my college, which is a major plus. It's mostly apartments around here, with a few decent, budget-friendly bars and eats thrown in.  One bar just got a fancy name change, and now it's a tad pricey, but the drinks and service aren't terrible.  The folks here are mostly chill – college kids or those on a tighter budget, since rents aren't exactly sky-high. There are tons of kids around 'cause there's an elementary school within spitting distance. Don't know my neighbors too well – kinda good that way. They're a bit...enthusiastic about their weed, so the building management put an air freshener right outside their door. Hilarious, yet kinda insulting, you know? \n\nThe buildings around here are mostly old-school looking, but some have been spruced up inside. There are some shiny new apartments down the street, but they scream \"cheap construction, inflated rent.\" They're basically cashing in on the college crowd.  Speaking of cheap eats, there's this place five minutes away that serves everything on paper plates – it's mostly microwaved stuff, but hey, it's cheap. Across the street is a gas station that supposedly has a horrible work environment. But thanks to some city dough, they redid the road last summer. Now there's a decent sidewalk, grassy medians, the whole nine yards. Makes the place feel a bit nicer.\n\nMy building is tucked away under a canopy of trees – they chopped down a few, leaving some gnarly stumps behind, but there are still plenty left. Behind my complex is a line of trees, then another set of apartments. I'm on 42nd street, but behind me is 43rd. Not as charming, let's just say that. Sidewalks are crumbling, buildings look rough around the edges, and there are more trees, probably to hide the shabbiness. Most of the crime around here seems to be concentrated in one complex on 43rd, but then again, another complex across the street has its share of issues too.  \n\nBut hey, I dig my spot. It's affordable, and it's got everything I need. Plus, the uni's a walk away, and there are two bus stops that get me to the shops and downtown in a flash.",
            "My neighborhood is like stepping back in time. It's made up of identical duplexes on a cul-de-sac, all painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. They're spaced out so they look like individual houses, and most of the neighbors know each other. We often gather at the end of driveways in the evenings, chatting while the kids play. It's a refreshing change from the constant hustle and bustle of the digital world.  \n\nWe're surrounded by fields and trees, with endless blue skies and fluffy clouds. It's pretty idyllic, but we've had some crazy weather lately. Tornado warnings have become common, and last night, we actually heard the sirens! I ended up in the bathtub with my smallest dog, my purse, and a few pillows, while my big dog stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The neighborhood was eerily quiet except for the sound of hail pummeling the ground.\n\nAfter the storm passed, the road was literally steaming from the temperature change. It went from 92 degrees to 75 in a flash! The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement. As the clouds cleared, a double rainbow appeared. I grabbed my camera and snapped some pictures to share with everyone. It was breathtaking.\n\nFor an hour after the storm, the neighborhood was deserted. Then, people started trickling back home. It was back to normal pretty quickly, with moms and kids outside again as dinner cooked. \n\nMy apartment is a two-bedroom, two-bath, just like everyone else's, though some of the apartments inside are surprisingly small. It's a friendly neighborhood, and I love the southern accents. I enjoy walking in the big field behind my place and strolling down to the pond (not for swimming, though!). I've even seen deer and heard the croaking of a giant bullfrog in the mornings. It's a fantastic place to live, just forty minutes outside Charlotte.\n\nEvery morning, we're woken up by the sound of roosters crowing from the nearby farms. It feels like living in a small village. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that brays in the evenings. I feel so lucky to have found this amazing neighborhood.",
            "Moving into this neighborhood right before eighth grade was a bit tough at first, friendship-wise. I eventually clicked with a couple of guys, one two houses down and another on my street. They've since moved away, but those memories stick with me. Most of the folks who were here when I first arrived are still around. It's pretty much your typical American suburb: loads of two-story houses, the sound of kids playing outside whenever the weather's good, and a generally quiet atmosphere most days. \n\nI haven't had any bad experiences with anyone here. You're left to your own devices unless you need something, and I've never had a package disappear from my porch. I feel pretty comfortable trusting my neighbors.\n\nThere's a park just a stone's throw away, packed with memories. We played basketball, football, and baseball there with the neighborhood crew. I even got clocked in the nose during a football game, which isn't my fondest memory, but the good times definitely outweigh the bad. These days, I mostly go there to hang out with my cousins' kids – they're still into swings, slides, and all that good stuff. Just the thought of the park gets them pumped. It brings back a lot of nostalgia for me.\n\nThe neighborhood's pretty diverse, with a whole bunch of different food options within walking distance. You can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants all within a mile. Of course, these days everyone's relying on apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for delivery. The usual suspects – fast food joints and pizza places – are plentiful, just like in any suburb.\n\nWe've got everything we need in terms of stores: dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, a Jewel-Osco grocery store (a Midwest favorite), and even an Indian-owned store for those craving homemade or ready-made Indian food. \n\nOverall, I love my neighborhood. Reading about other people's crazy neighbor stories online and on the news makes me appreciate mine even more.",
            "My town, Johnston, is a typical South Carolina town - nothing fancy, but it plays a big role in the farming world. It's known as the Peach Capital of the World, a title it proudly flaunts on its welcome sign.  Everywhere you look, it's either peach orchards or cattle farms. Houses outside the main part of town are spread out, mostly two-story homes with metal roofs to beat the summer heat or gray shingles. They're usually tucked away from the road, leaving space for fields in front.\n\nDowntown, you'll find a single traffic light where everything else hangs out. There are just a few stores in town:  Hong Kong, a small Chinese place run by a family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a local burger chain. A pizzeria used to be there but closed recently. There's also Maxwell and Halford Drug, a tiny family pharmacy famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola. The only grocery store is Independent Grocers Alliance (IGA), but it's pricey and most people head to a Walmart in the next town for their shopping.  Dollar General is the most popular spot, though. It's always packed with folks grabbing everyday essentials.\n\nThere's also a friendly furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a local favorite. It's been around forever and even has movers to deliver your new couch! Attached to the furniture store is Clark's Cuts and Kennels for all your pet grooming needs.\n\nThe doctor and vet's offices are further out from the main area, but they're well-equipped. There's only one elementary school, Johnston Elementary, but kids have to go to the next town for middle and high school.  \n\nWe're working on a 2.5-acre park, but right now, there aren't many places to hang out.  No movie theaters, bowling alleys, playgrounds, or even a specific dog park. It's a quiet town, easy to miss if you blink!",
            "So, the first time I heard about my building, I was listening to a podcast about missing persons. It was a bit of a surprise, considering how expensive this place is - every apartment here is over a thousand dollars a month! None of my friends had ever heard of any stories like that either. Maybe it's the struggle, you know? I know a few friends who cry themselves to sleep at night because things are so expensive. But we've learned to be frugal, to find joy in the dusty charm of flea market finds and vintage clothes. You kind of lose your sense of smell as you get older, or maybe you just get used to the way things are. But that flea market vibe, it always sticks around. It's the smell of old magazines piled on a dusty piano, clinging to your worn leather jacket even after you've washed it. There are three thrift stores within walking distance of my place. If you start at one end, you can hit up two charity shops, a library, a rare book store, and a quirky little curio shop. Downtown is packed with cars and people every morning, but inside those thrift stores, it's always eerily quiet. No matter how busy the streets are, the stores are sanctuaries of calm, perfect for escaping for an afternoon. Every year, there are more and more buildings going up, more cars and people flooding the streets. It's a growing city, they say, with one of the biggest online empires for e-commerce and delivery. It's still figuring things out, like a teenager going through awkward phases. It reminds me of New York, actually. Everyone's focused on their own thing, and nobody really expects you to do much more than stay out of their way. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people won't bat an eye. It's not like the South, where showing a little bit of concern is considered caring. Nobody really pries into your life here. You can keep your walls up as high as you want, and the city will just keep rolling on, like waves crashing on the beach. It's a lively place, for sure. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur singers upstairs, there's always something going on. I guess we're more of a community than just a bunch of strangers living in the same building. We come together for birthdays, funerals, to help each other out. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. We look out for each other, share food, help with errands. It's nice to see familiar faces, and I think they enjoy my company as much as I enjoy theirs. I live in this massive, impersonal concrete jungle, but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I haven't completely screwed up my life.",
            "This place I live in? Picture your standard, cookie-cutter suburb.  Seriously, it's like they used a template. You can practically thank the homeowner's association for the perfectly manicured lawns and identical front yards –  a little patch of grass, some pebbles, and driveways that are way too short. Every now and then you'll spot a sad little tree trying to make its way. Everyone's got a two-car garage, and the roads are like something out of a dream, all freshly paved with nary a pothole in sight. Most houses are single-story, but sometimes you'll stumble across a two-story one, breaking the monotony.  \n\nBut forget about those individual mailboxes you see everywhere else. Nope, here it's all communal. Big clusters of mailboxes at the end of the street, accessed with a key, and two massive lockers for packages. Gotta love the HOA's obsession with, well, everything being the same.\n\nMy house sits on the fringe of the city, so it's a bit of a weird mix – part rural, part suburbia.  We've got tons of space, which is cool. There are community pools (gated and fancy, of course), walking trails for your dog or your existential crisis, and enough space to run around and get your workout in.\n\nMostly, it's populated by retirees, which makes it super safe and everyone's always looking out for each other.  There are a few middle-aged and younger folks like me thrown in for good measure.\n\nThe city itself is a beast, surprisingly populous but still feeling like a small town. It has everything you need – one mall, which isn't huge but gets the job done. A 15-minute drive takes you to a world of shopping: organic grocery stores, bargain bins with staff who look like they'd rather be anywhere else... you name it.\n\nSo, yeah, my neighborhood is safe, clean, and pretty standard. It's nice, we've got amenities, and we're not too far from the action.",
            "I call my hometown a small Midwestern town, just outside the suburbs of a big city. The part of town I live in, on the east side, is the poorest. Houses are mostly rented or owned by folks who struggle financially, and property values are low. But it's not a bad place to be. My neighbors are friendly folks who always wave hello when I'm out walking. Sure, crime rates are a tad higher than other areas, but they're still pretty low overall. There have been a few violent incidents in the past ten years, a few shootings and even a homicide, all within a few blocks of my house. Last year, the family next door lost their son in a shooting outside a bar. Thankfully, our family has been lucky enough to avoid anything serious – just the occasional missing item from the porch if we forget to bring it inside.\n\nThis town, like many places, has been hit hard by the opioid crisis. Too many lives have been lost to fentanyl overdoses.  But there are good things happening too. We have several addiction recovery centers and Narcan training programs for families and friends impacted by this epidemic.\n\nDespite the challenges, there are a lot of good things about this town. My son's elementary school is amazing. From the principal to the teachers and support staff, everyone is dedicated. He's actually thrived there, even with his special needs, because the atmosphere is so positive. There’s a very active PTO that organizes events throughout the year to keep families involved and learning fun.\n\nBecause over 20% of our town lives below the poverty line, the school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students. No one feels less than because of their financial situation, and school fees, supplies, and field trips are affordable.\n\nThe City Council has made some improvements to the town, like fixing roads, planting trees, and sprucing up parks. Most of these upgrades are in the center of town and on the west side, where the shops and traffic are. The east side, where I live, tends to get overlooked, which is frustrating for us.\n\nOverall, I'm happy living here. People are friendly, the schools are great, there are plenty of stores, and our house might not be worth much, but it’s comfortable and homey. We’ve lived here for over 16 years, and I can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is bursting with character. It's perched on a hill, surrounded by buildings steeped in history. I live in a seven-story apartment building directly across from an old theater, and just a block down is a quirky arcade bar that draws all sorts of folks on warm summer nights. Especially during June and July, weekends often see a line snaking out the door. A few blocks up is the nearest city park, surprisingly spacious for its location. The park is enclosed by concrete, with steep steps built right into the wall. When winter hits, you'll see homeless folks setting up neat rows of tents along the sidewalk and those wide steps. It doesn't snow much here, but the heavy downpours that come in mid-winter make it tough to stay warm. Clustering together in the heart of town instead of out in the wilderness keeps them warmer, plus they're within easy reach of the only family center for miles, where they can shower and freshen up.\n\nBut what I truly love about this city isn't the historical charm – the majestic buildings, the architecture that climbs up the rolling hills towards the ocean. It's the people that make this neighborhood special. \n\nHilltop used to be notorious on the West Coast for gang violence. Even three decades later, you hear whispers of federal agents and the DEA swooping in, trying to clean up the streets.  The stories linger, passed down through generations, reaching even newcomers like me. These folks work hard, even though Hilltop is still considered one of the tougher neighborhoods, to keep things clean and safe. They take pride in their city, their block. You'll hear warnings about not walking around the Hill after dark if you're white – a relic of the past, tinged with the sting of prejudice. Maybe it's because I'm dark-skinned enough to blend in, or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of their own, someone who understands the constant reminders of racism, cultural bias, and assumptions based on ignorance and fear. Even in a city that claims to be a melting pot of cultures. \n\nOne thing's for sure: no matter where I go, Hilltop will always feel like home. The streets hum with life, and I've experienced more kindness than any other place.  People have offered me a jacket in the cold, opened their laundromats late so I could charge my phone in the rain, and even stopped to tell me I'm beautiful and valuable on the dreariest of nights.",
            "I live in a small town in rural Michigan, where farmlands give way to charming tourist spots. There's no bustling city life here – no big malls, chain stores like Walmart or Target, or even a familiar spot like Applebee's. You need a car to get anywhere you want to go.  Despite the lack of big-city amenities, I live in a truly beautiful place surrounded by water. My town is nestled between two stunning lakes – Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other.  Every direction you look, there's a beach within reach.\n\nMy neighborhood embodies the classic small-town feel. Houses aren't crammed together like in a city; they're spread out, each with its own unique character.  Some are older, with a touch of vintage charm, while others have been updated and modernized.  Many even have full basements visible from the street.  You'll find a rainbow of colors on the houses lining the blocks, with most boasting yards filled with trampolines, playsets, gardens, and even fences for animals. It's a picture-perfect representation of Middle America: hardworking families making a living, raising kids, and creating a sense of community.\n\nKids run freely down the streets, while you might also see people walking their dogs, biking, or rollerblading.  Everyone seems to know each other, and you can easily tell who belongs and who's just passing through. A friendly wave from someone grilling outside or a pleasant smile from a neighbor walking their dog a few blocks away is a common occurrence. Lawns are well-maintained, free of piles of leaves, with freshly mowed grass and neatly trimmed bushes.\n\nThis isn't a neighborhood that screams \"luxury,\" but it's the kind of place that makes you think, \"This would be a great place to raise a family.\" It's quiet, peaceful, and safe. While not outwardly glamorous, it embodies the essence of what people crave: a secure and welcoming place to call home.  \n\nWithin walking distance, you'll find the county sheriff's department, the jail, the health department, and the recycling center, all conveniently located and serving the needs of the community. Nearby baseball and softball fields echo with the excitement of games, and the rumble of small planes taking off and landing at our local airport adds a touch of charm to the daily soundtrack.  A short walk takes you to the local ice cream shop, and if you're feeling adventurous, you can even bike or walk downtown. My kids can easily ride their bikes to the park, just eight blocks away.\n\nThis small town is truly a great place to live."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "Living in a big city means my neighborhood is a melting pot. You've got residential areas popping up randomly between shops and businesses. Some spots are all offices, others are packed with restaurants, stores, and even entertainment venues.  There's always something new to try, whether it's a fancy chain restaurant or a quirky little boutique. These boutiques aren't just in malls, either; they're lining the streets, making even quiet neighborhoods feel like hubs of activity.\n\nOh, and did I mention the parks?  They're scattered around, and I see families with kids hanging out there all the time. Speaking of people, my neighborhood is a real mix.  There's a strong LGBTQ+ community, a bustling Orthodox Jewish group, and a bunch of immigrants from the former Soviet Union all in one spot.  \n\nVenturing a little further out, you'll find even more diversity, with pockets of Korean, Chinese, Armenian communities, and more. It's amazing, but sometimes those \"pockets\" can be miles away because traffic is brutal. Ten miles can easily take two hours during rush hour.  \n\nDon't even get me started on parking! It's a nightmare. It's ironic, though, because they keep building these massive apartment complexes.

To be honest, I don't even know most of my neighbors. It's not the tight-knit community it used to be, which I kind of miss.  Back in my childhood, I played outside with my neighbor and a few other kids all the time.  Those were the days!",
            "My neighborhood is a fascinating mix of old and new. Most houses are single-family homes, but some have been cleverly divided into two units while staying connected. My place has a small front yard and a tiny driveway, typical of the suburban dream that still lingers here. It feels like a snapshot of a past era when this type of living was the epitome of the American ideal. While that dream may be fading for some, my neighborhood holds onto it tightly.\n\nThe residents aren't as optimistic as they once were; the yards aren't as meticulously kept, but the driveways still boast a couple of cars, and the kids still play with an infectious energy, treating the world as their own playground. The local public school, a landmark for almost 90 years, stands strong, inspiring hope in the young and evoking nostalgia in the older folks. Churches are scarce, often empty, but the basketball courts buzz with activity. The houses may look different, but they share a similar soul.\n\nThere's a large supermarket named Super \"A,\" owned by a Yemeni family who are likely the only Arab families in the neighborhood. Most residents are African American, and the streets are wide enough for kids to play football, pausing only to let cars pass. Many families have lived here for generations, reminiscing about a time when everyone knew everyone. A former karate school, now a pharmacy, stands as a reminder of how quickly trends change. The kids lost interest when Hollywood stopped churning out \"Karate Kid\" movies, apparently opting for quick fixes instead.\n\nA small, independent movie theatre screens classic films at affordable prices, catering to older residents who appreciate a night out without the hustle and bustle of modern cinemas. The younger generation, however, prefers newer releases and shuns the theatre's vintage offerings.\n\nAn expressway cuts through our town, but its entrance and exit are just across the border in the neighboring town. Once, there was a strong push to build an exit in our town, supported by the younger generation, but opposed by the older residents who feared it would disrupt the neighborhood's tranquility. They ultimately prevailed, persuading the city council to deny the petition.\n\nNow, a new high school is under construction, and the town is debating its mascot.  I believe a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would perfectly encapsulate the unique spirit of my hometown.",
            "This neighborhood might seem unremarkable at first glance - it's tucked behind a shopping strip, not exactly the kind of place you'd expect to find hidden communities. But if you venture past the old, shuttered Whole Foods and behind the mostly empty hotels (except for a few summer family reunions), you'll stumble upon a thriving, secret world.  \n\nDown a winding road, you'll see a line of apartment complexes nestled together like Russian nesting dolls that have been carefully disassembled and lined up.  The first complex has a bit of a bad reputation - let's just say appearances can be deceiving. But the complexes next door are a different story altogether, a hidden world known only to a select few.\n\nAcross the street is a quiet community college campus, with students shuffling in and out with coffee cups, yawning at the crack of dawn. The iron gates creak open to let them in, while impatient commuters shake their fists at the traffic delays.  \n\nThe road intersects with another residential street, where a park and a rehabilitation center stand side-by-side.  The rehabilitation center has a cheerful porch and a lazy ceiling fan that stirs the warm summer air. Kids play in the park, while retirees walk their dogs, occasionally glaring at the teenagers skateboarding by and exchanging knowing glances with the teenage girls huddled around the playground, gossiping about boys and the latest trends.\n\nThere's a strip mall nearby with a sushi place that's always fairly empty, a swimming supply store, and a nail salon -  imagine getting a manicure while stocking up on pool supplies and having some hibachi chicken!  There's even a DIY frozen yogurt shop, where teens often gather, clutching cold cups of sugary goodness as they perform skateboard tricks and vape.\n\nThis neighborhood is a snapshot of Americana - a timeless piece of the South where life moves at a slower pace and change is a rare occurrence.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove past endless cornfields. I knew she'd be stunned by the wide-open spaces.  She came from a town where you could walk to the grocery store in five minutes; she'd never seen anything like this. Overwhelmed by the sea of corn, I told her about growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood who I was and where I came from.\n\nWe turned onto a two-lane road, and soon we passed a quarry filled with water. Just past it was the small development I lived in.  Most of the houses were brick and stucco, each sitting on at least half an acre of land that everyone took pride in keeping up.  Springtime brought a riot of color with planted flowers and the changing leaves of the midwestern trees. The driveways were filled with gleaming Mercedes-Benz luxury cars, sparkling after a good wash.\n\nAs we continued down the road towards my grey stucco house, I saw my Korean neighbor outside, his friendly face always a welcome sight. He spent his days mowing his lawn, his singing blending with the hum of the mower. Everyone in the neighborhood chuckled at him, but he was a genuinely kind person with a fascinating past. He'd been a doctor before, and these days he blended in with the grass and his John Deere Zero Turn mower.\n\nFinally, we reached my house. Geese grazed in the side yard, chased by our terrier. Behind the house, a small stream flowed into the quarry, where we could hear bullfrogs croaking, the water babbling, and the occasional moo from the nearby farms. We crossed a handmade wooden bridge to an untouched oasis filled with trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was where I spent most of my childhood, building tree forts, pretending to hunt (mostly chasing squirrels), and always finding a friend to play with.\n\nWinters in our small town were harsh, but beautiful. The yard transformed from a lush green into a stark wilderness.  Trees that once showcased vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers became bare skeletons of bark. When it snowed, a winter wonderland appeared overnight.  Snow angels adorned the backyard, along with snowmen. My sister and I fought constantly as kids, and snowballs were our weapon of choice.  We built massive igloo-like forts to store our branches, like an arsenal. In our own little winter kingdom, we played pretend, forgetting everything else. We were just kids, carefree and full of life.",
            "Alright, so you wanna know about Portland, Oregon? First off, you gotta understand what \"weird\" means here. It's not just a label, it's practically the city motto, plastered on some building that somehow manages to be a pizza place, bar, music venue, and strip club all at once.  Some folks see it as a throwback to the good ol' days, back when Portland was a hidden gem, cheaper and more underground. Others, well, they see it as an invitation: come on down, be weird, and we'll celebrate it.\n\nNow, even with all the fancy Californians moving in and condos popping up everywhere, Portland still holds onto its weirdness.  It's not about blindly accepting everything, mind you. We've got our share of modern problems, like everyone else. We buy our stuff from China, have yoga studios and hipsters, and even business types.  Maybe it's just that we take it all a little less seriously.\n\nTake my neighborhood, for example. Our streets are lined with colorful houses, gardens bursting with flowers, herbs, and veggies, and there are these magical things called \"free boxes\" everywhere in the summer.  These boxes, usually cardboard but sometimes plastic bags, are filled with random treasures – clothes, books, who knows what else! It's like a scavenger hunt of possibility.\n\nThat's what Portland is to me: a place where you can be yourself, whatever that might be. But there are a thousand different kinds of weird here. Some folks would never dream of digging through a free box, they're off doing goat yoga or cheering on the Timbers, the city's soccer team.  We've got people who chase their dreams, people who dream about chasing their dreams, and everyone in between.\n\nSure, Portland has its issues – we've got a drug problem, a homelessness problem – things no city seems to have a perfect solution for.  But hey, we're not weird enough to be immune to those.  What we do have is a lot of heart, a lot of creativity, and a whole lot of weirdness.",
            "The mountains are always a constant presence, standing tall to the north. They witness every sunrise and sunset, no matter how busy I get or how much I forget about them. They remain unwavering, unfazed by life's ups and downs. On the days when stress gets the best of me, they seem to call out to me, offering a place of peace and strength. I first fell in love with them when I started college. Sure, the university itself is beautiful, with its buildings, ponds, and trees, but the mountains hold a special place in my heart. The town itself is charming, with countless cafés where I spent countless hours studying, and a bustling downtown area with historical buildings that bring a sense of antiquity. However, just a short walk away, the town reverts back to its peaceful, suburban atmosphere. This blend of energy and serenity is what makes this place so unique. \n\nOver the years, I've created countless memories here, both good and bad. Whether it's walking with friends after an all-nighter, rushing through downtown to catch a movie, or having heartfelt conversations by the ponds, each spot in town holds a story. The ponds, in particular, have been a place for reflection, both joyful and melancholic. \n\nOne day, while feeling lost and uncertain, I found myself walking north, towards the mountains. The sun was shining, illuminating the sky as I looked up. And there they were, standing strong and majestic, reminding me of my ability to persevere.",
            "Alright, so you're thinking of checking out Bensonhurst, Brooklyn? Let me tell you, finding your way around is a breeze, thanks to the city's awesome public transport system. You'll definitely be in the heart of NYC vibes here - it's a pretty urban neighborhood.  \n\nGet ready for a serious dose of Asian culture, because Bensonhurst has become a hub for Asian residents over the past couple of decades.  Seriously, you'll practically bump into an Asian-owned store on every block - supermarkets, laundromats, the works. And local peeps swear by these places, praising the amazing food, super affordable prices, and unbeatable convenience. I'm talking four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk of each other!\n\nBut Bensonhurst isn't just an Asian enclave, it's a melting pot of cultures with immigrants, first-gen, and second-gen Americans all calling it home.  You'll see a mix of businesses, but Asian-owned ones definitely dominate. \n\nOh, and there's this awesome recently renovated park nearby, with tons of basketball courts, a massive field for soccer or baseball, handball courts, a playground, and even a water fountain for the little ones. It's a real testament to NYC's diversity - you'll see people from all walks of life chilling and playing together. \n\nYou won't find any massive corporate buildings here, just co-ops, condos, and a whole lot of two-family houses. The people are generally friendly, but they can get a bit loud.  Think cars blasting music and revving engines - it's not exactly quiet living!\n\nNow, while Bensonhurst is generally safe, it's still New York, so you gotta be street smart, especially at night.  There are always a few unpredictable characters around, and you might encounter some troublemakers. I've had my share of run-ins, including a physical assault a while back (don't worry, it's ancient history!), and package theft is a real issue. \n\nAnd speaking of issues, let's talk about dog poop.  NYC has rules about cleaning up after your furry friends, but nobody seems to follow them in Bensonhurst. Be prepared to dodge landmines on your way to the train or the supermarket. Seriously, it's a constant struggle to keep your shoes clean!",
            "My neighborhood's a bit of a strange place.  It's all hills, really, and my house is perched right at the top of the steepest one - they call it \"workout hill\" because all the joggers love to run up it.  The street itself has no sidewalks, so everyone walks right on the road, which is kind of bumpy and dodgy in spots. The power lines strung up around the place are a mess, always getting hit by branches and looking all patched up from repairs. Rain and storms are pretty common here, so that probably doesn't help. Everywhere you look, there are massive evergreen trees, but everyone seems to hate them. They chop them down whenever they can because they block the view of the ocean. That's why so many houses are built way up on the hill, with huge, glass-fronted second stories to get a glimpse of the bay.  It's pretty amazing at sunset, when the water glows and the sky turns orange.  But it's usually cloudy, so the sun only peeks through in a hazy way most of the time.  It's pretty damp and overcast most days, and moss grows everywhere - even on cars and railings. I once left my car parked for a month, and it ended up covered in green fluff! It took ages to clean it off.  There aren't many kids around here, though there's a school nearby. Mostly, it's older folks, a lot of them retired.  Instead of kids, everyone has dogs – they're constantly running around, and you have to be careful because they'll wander into your house if you leave a door or window open.  I found one in my living room once!  Rabbits are another problem – they're everywhere, and the gardeners hate them because they dig up their plants.  My cats love them though, so they've almost cleared them out.  There are the usual birds too - sparrows, hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle until the crows chase them away.\n\nThere aren't any shops around here, but if you head down to the waterfront, there are a few places that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach, but the rocks along the shore are fun to chuck in the water. The bay isn't very wide – you can easily see the other side, even through the mist.",
            "My neighborhood is pretty typical for a suburb in a small Southern town in Tennessee. It's a connector street between two state highways, so we get more traffic than I'd prefer, but it's mostly quiet.  The people here are pretty familiar, as folks don't move in and out much. You know, the usual neighborhood stuff: yard work, daily chores, kids riding bikes, dogs being walked. We work from home, a family of four: my wife, myself, and our two daughters, eleven and fourteen. We're pretty visible since we're always coming and going, and everyone knows us. We spend a lot of time outdoors, even in the rain.  We grill on the back deck sometimes, filling the air with that barbecue smell. You can practically hear a lawnmower every day from March to October, thanks to all the trees lining the streets. It's a bit of a wooded area, so come fall, there's an abundance of leaves.  That means raking and burning, which I actually enjoy because it means fall has arrived. Lately, we haven't had much of a winter, so it just feels like a long fall. Our garage is at the back, so we mostly use the front door when someone knocks, which isn't often. When I work on projects in the garage, with the doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays are pretty quiet around here, except for Thanksgiving and Mother's Day or Christmas, when relatives come to visit and fill the streets with cars. Overall, I like living here. If it weren't for the through traffic, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is smack-dab in the middle of the high desert. It's all dirt, dirt, and more dirt. You folks who haven't lived here wouldn't get it – the constant brown scenery. When you do see a lawn, you know that person's dropping serious cash on keeping it green. Back in the 90s when I first moved here, the houses were spread out like they were trying to avoid each other.  Now, things are getting a bit more crowded, with new places popping up everywhere.  Honestly, it's starting to feel more like a city every day, though I guess that's happening everywhere.\n\nMost folks here are super friendly, but like any place, you've got your good and bad parts.  My neighborhood is surrounded by really nice older folks, so it's a pretty chill place to live.  Shopping-wise, it's mostly chains like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want something upscale,  you gotta drive a bit. I don't see any Whole Foods or anything like that around here.\n\nLooking around, construction seems to be the biggest industry, probably because there's still so much undeveloped land. It's a bit scary, honestly. I like things the way they are now. I moved away from a big city and I'm not looking to go back. Speaking of construction, that's where I work full-time – I'm a drywall and T-bar installer.\n\nWhat I love about living here is the wildlife. People come to the high desert for all sorts of reasons, but the unique beauty of the desert landscape is definitely a big draw. This harsh environment has created some wild and amazing ecosystems that we need to protect. All of us who live here should take the time to learn about the animals that share our space so we can all get along. My family and I have adapted really well to sharing our home with wildlife. My kids are obsessed with lizards and desert bugs – right now they're outside trying to catch some!\n\nAs for things to do, we've got a few attractions.  Victorville is a pretty cool place for families, offering a different kind of experience. If you're visiting, try to time it with the San Bernardino County Fair – it's a blast!  And just a short drive away, you can check out Wrightwood for some snow-covered mountains and awesome winter sports.  If you're into history and nature, the Victor Valley Museum is a must-see. They've got geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and stuff about the history of the town.",
            "Okay, so when people ask me about my neighborhood, I guess my answer is a little different.  Most folks probably think of houses and yards and all that, but my \"hood\" is actually the college campus I live on. My dorm building is like my tight-knit community, and the whole campus is my extended neighborhood, even if I don't hang out there as much.  \n\nBut hey, even though it's a campus, it still kinda feels like a regular neighborhood. You've got your houses, your people, your shops, and even a park!  \n\nLet's start with the \"houses.\"  Here, there are three main types: apartments, regular houses, and dorm rooms.  Apartments usually have a few people per room, maybe 4 or 6 rooms per floor, and they house about 20 people total. Then there are the actual houses, which are rented out to folks with a connection to the school, mostly alumni.  There aren't that many of these, though, because they're not as efficient. And lastly, there are the classic dorm rooms, which are basically where most of us students live. Two people per room, hundreds of students in each building, you know the drill. \n\nAnd speaking of students, my school is super diverse, and that totally shows in my neighborhood. People from all walks of life live here – different cultures, different ages, the whole shebang.  The staff mostly live in the houses, newer students are in the dorms, and the older ones usually snag apartments. It's a real melting pot!\n\nOf course, there are also shops and a park! We've got all the usual dining spots, plus some school-specific stores for clothes and groceries. Basically, you can find everything you need right here. The park is pretty cool too – a place for everyone to chill out and relax, kept clean and safe by the whole community.",
            "So, I've been living here for about a decade now, so I guess it's time to spill the tea on this hood. When I first moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge, let me tell you, I was a mess. I was bawling my eyes out missing my old stomping grounds and the people I loved. But my parents, bless their hearts, had the best intentions. They wanted a better life for me and my little sis,  a nicer house, a better school, the whole nine yards. You know, the whole \"not ghetto\" vibe.  \n\nIt took a while to adjust, but I eventually made some new friends (and a few frenemies, let's be real).  The only neighbors I really got to know were Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis for a bit. They're like family to me, honestly.  I remember when my fam and I went to Mr. Glen's wedding - he and his wife got hitched again! It was a blast, a real party, and something I hope to experience someday when I'm all settled down and ready to treat my future wife like a queen. \n\nI even snagged Mr. Glen's wife, Ms. Veda's, little white strap when she tossed it! Shame I didn't catch the flowers though. We danced the night away, and I had a great time hanging with Marsharii, one of their daughters. Haven't seen her since, but I hope she's doing well.  \n\nThis neighborhood feels like a labyrinth, but now that I have GPS, I'm finally exploring it more. I've mostly stuck to my usual spots, where I hang out with my buddies Kason and Curtis. We used to be all about video games and just living it up. Sometimes I'd chill in the park, soak in the nature, you know, find my peace. I even bring some sticks from Home Depot and practice my balance, sometimes even my bokken.\n\nThere's a basketball and tennis court too, though I haven't touched those in ages.  Still nice to have them around for when I feel like getting active.  My dad actually got me and my best friend into tennis with Mr. Graves, we had a blast! Those guys were tough, but we always had a good time.\n\nI've had a lot of fun in this neighborhood, man, a ton of memories. These are just a few that stick out.  I have a feeling the best is yet to come!",
            "My digs are pretty sweet because they're a stone's throw from my college.  Mostly apartments, but there are a few decent bars and restaurants that won't break the bank.  One bar just got a fancy new name and jacked up the prices, but the drinks are still decent. The vibe is pretty chill, mostly college kids and people making ends meet, you know? It's a family-friendly neighborhood too, with an elementary school right down the street. I'm not on a first-name basis with my neighbors, and honestly, I'm good with that.  They're a bit...enthusiastic about the herb,  so the building management stuck an air freshener right outside their door. Classic! \n\nMost of the buildings around here are old-school, but some of them have gotten a modern makeover inside. There's a brand new apartment complex down the road, but it's a total scam.  They slapped it together cheap, but the rent is sky-high because it's near campus. The best thing about this neighborhood is the cheap eats. There's this hole-in-the-wall joint that serves everything on paper plates, mostly microwave-able stuff, but it hits the spot. Across the street is a gas station that probably wouldn't be my cup of tea to work at.\n\nBut hey, the city coughed up some cash to redo the road last summer.  Now we've got a swanky new sidewalk, lush greenery everywhere, and the whole place feels a bit classier. My building is tucked away behind a bunch of trees, although they chopped down a few recently.  The streets behind my place are a little rougher. Crumbling sidewalks and buildings that look like they've seen better days.  But hey, at least there are trees to hide it all! Crime mostly seems to be concentrated in one apartment complex on that street, but then again, there’s another one across the street that’s got its share of issues. \n\nOverall, I'm pretty content with my little corner of the world.  It's affordable, close to campus, and has all the essentials. Plus, there are two bus stops that make it easy to get around.",
            "My neighborhood is a charming collection of identical houses, each painted yellow with white porches and green roofs, arranged on a cul-de-sac like individual dwellings. They're spaced out just enough to look like stand-alone homes, but most of the residents know each other.  We often gather at the end of driveways, catching up while the kids play outside, a heartwarming scene in this increasingly digital world. It feels like stepping back in time, surrounded by fields, trees, and endless blue skies dotted with fluffy clouds.\n\nThe only downside? We've been dealing with tornado warnings lately, and last night, we actually heard the sirens.  I found myself scrambling for shelter in the bathtub with my little dog, clutching my purse and some pillows. My big guy, though, wasn't keen on sharing the bathroom and stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The neighborhood was eerily quiet except for the pounding hail.  After the storm passed, the roads steamed from the rapid temperature change, the hail melting instantly on the hot pavement.\n\nAs the skies cleared, a double rainbow appeared! I grabbed my camera and snapped some pictures to share with everyone on Facebook – they were just as amazed as I was.  Everyone stayed inside for a while, then slowly trickled back out, resuming our usual evening routine. It's a truly friendly place, especially for a transplant like myself, who recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I love the Southern accents and the close-knit community feel. \n\nWe all live in identical two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartments, though the insides vary. Some are surprisingly small! I enjoy walking through the big field behind my place down to the pond (though no swimming allowed). I've spotted deer roaming around and hear a giant bullfrog croaking every morning. It's a fantastic place to live, just forty minutes outside Charlotte. We're awakened each morning by the sound of roosters crowing from nearby farms, like living in a tiny village.  There's even a donkey at a nearby farm that brays in the evenings, letting us know he's around. I feel incredibly lucky to have found this hidden gem of a neighborhood.",
            "I moved into this neighborhood right before eighth grade, and making friends was tough at first. I eventually became close with a couple of guys, one who lived just a couple of houses down and another on my street. They've both moved on since then, but the memories we made are still there. Most of the people who were here when I first arrived are still around. It's your typical American suburb, with lots of two-story houses.  On weekends or any day the weather's nice, you can always hear kids playing outside. Things are pretty quiet most of the time. I've never had any problems with the neighbors – people tend to keep to themselves unless you need something. I've ordered stuff online without worrying about porch pirates, so I definitely feel safe here. \n\nThere's a park just a few minutes from my place that's loaded with memories. I played basketball, football, and baseball with the neighborhood guys there. I even got elbowed in the nose during a football game – one of my worst memories tied to that park! But the good times definitely outweigh the bad. Nowadays, I mostly go to the park to hang out with my cousin's kids. They're way younger than me, still excited about swings and slides. Just thinking about the park takes me back.\n\nThe neighborhood is pretty diverse, with all kinds of food options within a short distance. You can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants all within a mile.  Of course, a lot of people just order in through apps like GrubHub and DoorDash these days. The usual suspects – fast food joints – are around, but you'd find those in any suburb. There are plenty of pizza places too. The stores here have everything you could need. There are a couple of dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and even a Jewel-Osco grocery store. And there's even an Indian-owned store if you're craving some homemade or ready-made Indian food.\n\nOverall, I really like my neighborhood. Seeing the crazy stuff some people deal with in their neighborhoods on social media and the news makes me appreciate mine even more.",
            "My town, Johnston, is pretty typical for South Carolina. It ain't flashy, but it's got a big heart, especially when it comes to peaches.  They call themselves the \"Peach Capital of the World,\" and you'll see it plastered on the welcome sign.  Most of the town is just farmland, either bursting with peach trees or filled with grazing cattle.  \n\nHouses are spread out, mostly two-story affairs with metal roofs to beat the summer heat or gray shingles.  You won't find them right on the road; they're usually tucked back, giving the front yard space for animals or crops. The town center is small, with just one stoplight at the crossroads.  That's where you'll find all the shops, too.  \n\nHungry?  You've got three choices for \"fast food\": Hong Kong, a family-run Chinese joint, Fiesta for Mexican, and Gary's, a local burger chain.  Used to be a pizza place, but it shut down a while back.  Maxwell and Halford Drug is the local pharmacy, and they're famous for their Cherry Coca-Cola.  Then there's IGA, the only grocery store, but it's pricey, so most folks head to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for their main grocery haul.  The real star of the town is Dollar General. It's packed all day long, selling everything you could need.\n\nThere's a small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a sweetheart of a woman.  It's been around forever and even has two movers who'll deliver your new sofa!  Attached to the furniture store is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, where they take care of your furry friends with daycare, boarding, grooming, and all that good stuff.\n\nThe doctor and vet are out in the countryside, small practices but well-equipped.  There's a single elementary school, Johnston Elementary, but once kids finish fifth grade, they go to middle and high school in the next town.  \n\nJohnston doesn't have any parks, but they're trying to build a little recreation area.  It's pretty quiet here, no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or places to hang out.  Not much to do, really.  But it's a nice, cozy town, the kind you could miss if you blink.",
            "The first time I heard about my apartment building, it was on a podcast about missing persons. It was a bit of a shock, since most apartments in the area went for over a thousand dollars a month. None of my friends had ever heard of this story either. Maybe it's the struggle, I thought. I know some of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've gotten pretty good at being frugal over the years. You start to appreciate the musty scent of flea market toys and clothes that have been tucked away for a while. You don't smell as much as an adult. You might pick up smoking, or maybe it's just getting used to the way things are. But the flea market always pulls you back in. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines piled on a closed piano. It seeps into the leather and stays there even after you wash it.  \n\nHere, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start on one side, you can hit up two charity shops, a library, a rare books store, and a quirky little shop selling all sorts of odds and ends. Downtown is packed with cars and people every morning, but you'd never hear it inside the thrift stores.  No matter how many people or cars pass by, it's always quiet. It's a great place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there are more and more of these types of places popping up. Cars and people flood the streets. It's a growing city, they say. With one of the biggest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still going through growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone here is focused on their own goals, and no one really asks much of you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where showing even a little concern means you care a lot. People here don't pry into each other's lives. You can keep your distance as long as you want, and the city will keep moving like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be.\n\nBetween the pianist next door and the two amateur singers upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment full of strangers and more of a community of friends. We come together to celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other out when we need it. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I really like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I try to be respectful, clean up after myself, and leave them food, and they do the same for me. I bring them their mail, and they bring mine. It's nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my company as much as I do theirs. I live in a huge, impersonal modernist sprawl, but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't completely screw up my life.",
            "My hood is straight-up suburbia, like the kind you see in movies. You know, the one with the homeowner's association that's got everyone doing the same thing. As soon as you drive in, it's all manicured lawns, identical houses, and those super short driveways.  Everyone's got a two-car garage and the roads are pristine – no potholes in sight. I guess that's what you get when you've got a HOA breathing down your neck.\n\nMost houses are single-story, but you'll see a few two-story ones sprinkled in.  We don't have those regular mailboxes you'd expect. It's more like an apartment setup, with a big bank of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone's got their own key, and there are even giant lockers for packages. Again, thanks, HOA!\n\nLiving on the edge of the city, it's kinda a mix of suburbia and country. We've got tons of space, which means multiple community pools that everyone can use. They're gated and super clean. Plus, there are walking trails everywhere – perfect for taking your dog for a walk or just getting some fresh air.\n\nMost of the neighbors are retirees. It's a really safe place, and everyone looks out for each other. We also have a few middle-aged and young professionals mixed in.\n\nThe city itself is pretty big, but it has a small-town vibe. We've got all the essentials – like one mall, which isn't huge, but gets the job done. It takes about 15 minutes to get there, but once you're there, you've got all kinds of stores, from fancy organic grocery stores to bargain outlets.\n\nOverall, my neighborhood is pretty typical – safe, well-kept, and predictable. We've got nice amenities like pools and trails, and while we're not right next to any major shopping centers, a quick drive gets you there.",
            "I call this little Midwestern town home. It's just outside the sprawling suburbs of a big city. My neighborhood, on the east side, is the less affluent part of town.  The houses here are mostly rentals or owned by folks who aren't rolling in dough. It's not a bad place, though.  My neighbors are generally friendly, always waving and saying hello. Crime isn't exactly low, it's a bit higher than in other parts of town, but not by much.  There have been a couple of shootings and even a homicide a few blocks away in the past ten years.  It hit home when our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a bar last year. Luckily, our family hasn't been directly affected by crime, except maybe the occasional missing item from our porch if we forget to bring it in.\n\nThe whole town, like a lot of places, has been struggling with the opioid epidemic.  Sadly, there have been some lives lost to fentanyl overdoses. But there are good things happening too. There are addiction recovery centers and Narcan training programs for families and friends, helping folks fight this problem.\n\nDespite the challenges, there are plenty of good things about this town. My son loves his elementary school. The principal, teachers, and support staff are all fantastic. He hasn't faced any bullying, even though he has special needs, because the school has such a positive atmosphere. The PTO is super active, organizing events throughout the year to get families involved and support the kids' learning.  Since over 20% of the town lives below the poverty line, the school provides free breakfast and lunch to all the students so no kid ever goes hungry.  No one is made to feel less than because they can't afford things. School fees, supplies, and field trips are also very reasonable.\n\nThe City Council has been working hard to improve the town, fixing roads, adding landscaping, and sprucing up the parks.  Most of these improvements seem to be happening in the downtown area and on the west side, where most of the shops and traffic are. The east side, where I live, tends to get left behind, which is frustrating for folks like me.\n\nAll in all, I'm happy living here. The people are friendly, the schools are great, there are plenty of places to shop, and our house might not be worth much, but it's comfy and we have everything we need. We've been here for over 16 years, and it feels like home.",
            "My neighborhood's got this crazy vibe, you know?  It's perched on a hill, surrounded by buildings with stories etched into their walls.  I live in a seven-story apartment building right across from this old theater, and just down the street is this awesome arcade bar that draws in all kinds of people on warm summer nights.  Especially in June and July, you'll see lines of folks waiting to get in, especially on weekends.  A few blocks up is a park, surprisingly big for this part of town. It's walled in with concrete and has these massive steps built right into it. During the winter, when it gets freezing, you'll see homeless folks setting up their tents in rows along the sidewalk and those steps. It doesn't snow much here, but the winter rains are brutal, and huddled together in the city center keeps them warmer than out in the open. Plus, they're close to the only family center for miles, where they can shower and wash up.\n\nBut the coolest thing about my city isn't the history, the grand buildings, or the architecture spilling down the hills towards the ocean.  What gets me is the people. Hilltop, where I live, used to be known for gang violence, the toughest place on the West Coast. Even now, thirty years later, you hear stories about cops and the DEA cracking down, trying to clean things up.  The people here remember.  These stories get passed down through generations, even to newcomers like me. \n\nDespite the rough reputation it still has, they work hard to keep the neighborhood clean and care about what's happening on their streets. You hear folks say white people shouldn't walk around Hilltop after dark.  I think that's just old history clinging on, a bitter taste of prejudice. Maybe it's because I'm brown enough to blend in, or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of them, someone who gets it, who sees the reminders of racism and assumptions everywhere, even in a city that's supposed to be a melting pot. \n\nWhatever it is, I know I'm home here. Walking those streets at night, meeting people who are more likely to offer you a jacket than rob you, that's real life. It's the laundromat owner who waits a few extra minutes so you can charge your phone when you're trapped by the rain.  It's the stranger who sees you huddled against a store front on a dark night, looks you in the eye, hands you five bucks, and tells you you're beautiful and valuable. That's Hilltop.",
            "I live in small-town Michigan, the type of place where farmland gives way to charming tourist spots. You won't find any big-city chains like malls, Wal-Mart, Target, or even an Applebee's here.  Getting around means hopping in the car, but it's worth it because I live in one of the most beautiful places imaginable, surrounded by glistening water on all sides. \n\nLake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix frame my \"city,\" making it easy to find a beach for a quick dip. My neighborhood is pure small-town charm. Houses aren't crammed together, they're individual, with some updated and others proudly sporting their vintage character.  Most have full basements visible from the street, and you'll see a rainbow of colors in the aluminum siding, each house boasting a unique personality.\n\nMost yards feature trampolines, playsets, and gardens, with some even housing fences for furry friends. These homes embody the hardworking spirit of Middle America - families raising kids or enjoying the fruits of their labor. It's a place where kids play freely on the streets, you'll see neighbors chatting over fences, and dogs getting their daily exercise.  There's a genuine sense of community, where everyone knows each other, and if you're new in town, you'll quickly learn who's who.\n\nThe lawns are well-maintained, a testament to local pride.  It's not a neighborhood that screams luxury, but rather one that whispers, \"This is a safe and welcoming place to raise a family.\" It's quiet, peaceful, and safe.\n\nEven within walking distance are essential services like the sheriff's department, jail, health department, and recycling center, all contributing to the practical convenience of small-town life.  You can hear the thrill of baseball games from nearby fields, with the nearby airport adding a touch of adventure with the rumble of small planes taking off and landing. A local ice cream shop is just a short stroll away, and a bike ride takes you to a nearby park."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "Living in a big city means my neighborhood is a melting pot. You've got residential areas popping up randomly between shops and businesses. Some spots are all offices, others are packed with restaurants, stores, and even entertainment venues.  There's always something new to try, whether it's a fancy chain restaurant or a quirky little boutique. These boutiques aren't just in malls, either; they're lining the streets, making even quiet neighborhoods feel like hubs of activity.\n\nOh, and did I mention the parks?  They're scattered around, and I see families with kids hanging out there all the time. Speaking of people, my neighborhood is a real mix.  There's a strong LGBTQ+ community, a bustling Orthodox Jewish group, and a bunch of immigrants from the former Soviet Union all in one spot.  \n\nVenturing a little further out, you'll find even more diversity, with pockets of Korean, Chinese, Armenian communities, and more. It's amazing, but sometimes those \"pockets\" can be miles away because traffic is brutal. Ten miles can easily take two hours during rush hour.  \n\nDon't even get me started on parking! It's a nightmare. It's ironic, though, because they keep building these massive apartment complexes. The city seems to be a magnet, but a lot of people are worried about overcrowding and even more traffic.\n\nThankfully, there's still some variety in housing. Not everyone craves a massive apartment building.  You've got your single-family homes, duplexes, smaller apartment buildings, and even condos, all within my neighborhood.  \n\nThe neighborhood itself is a mix of ages, too.  To be honest, I don't even know most of my neighbors. It's not the tight-knit community it used to be, which I kind of miss.  Back in my childhood, I played outside with my neighbor and a few other kids all the time.  Those were the days!",
            "My neighborhood is a fascinating mix of old and new. Most houses are single-family homes, but some have been cleverly divided into two units while staying connected. My place has a small front yard and a tiny driveway, typical of the suburban dream that still lingers here. It feels like a snapshot of a past era when this type of living was the epitome of the American ideal. While that dream may be fading for some, my neighborhood holds onto it tightly.\n\nThe residents aren't as optimistic as they once were; the yards aren't as meticulously kept, but the driveways still boast a couple of cars, and the kids still play with an infectious energy, treating the world as their own playground. The local public school, a landmark for almost 90 years, stands strong, inspiring hope in the young and evoking nostalgia in the older folks. Churches are scarce, often empty, but the basketball courts buzz with activity. The houses may look different, but they share a similar soul.\n\nThere's a large supermarket named Super \"A,\" owned by a Yemeni family who are likely the only Arab families in the neighborhood. Most residents are African American, and the streets are wide enough for kids to play football, pausing only to let cars pass. Many families have lived here for generations, reminiscing about a time when everyone knew everyone. A former karate school, now a pharmacy, stands as a reminder of how quickly trends change. The kids lost interest when Hollywood stopped churning out \"Karate Kid\" movies, apparently opting for quick fixes instead.\n\nA small, independent movie theatre screens classic films at affordable prices, catering to older residents who appreciate a night out without the hustle and bustle of modern cinemas. The younger generation, however, prefers newer releases and shuns the theatre's vintage offerings.\n\nAn expressway cuts through our town, but its entrance and exit are just across the border in the neighboring town. Once, there was a strong push to build an exit in our town, supported by the younger generation, but opposed by the older residents who feared it would disrupt the neighborhood's tranquility. They ultimately prevailed, persuading the city council to deny the petition.\n\nNow, a new high school is under construction, and the town is debating its mascot.  I believe a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would perfectly encapsulate the unique spirit of my hometown.",
            "This neighborhood might seem unremarkable at first glance - it's tucked behind a shopping strip, not exactly the kind of place you'd expect to find hidden communities. But if you venture past the old, shuttered Whole Foods and behind the mostly empty hotels (except for a few summer family reunions), you'll stumble upon a thriving, secret world.  \n\nDown a winding road, you'll see a line of apartment complexes nestled together like Russian nesting dolls that have been carefully disassembled and lined up.  The first complex has a bit of a bad reputation - let's just say appearances can be deceiving. But the complexes next door are a different story altogether, a hidden world known only to a select few.\n\nAcross the street is a quiet community college campus, with students shuffling in and out with coffee cups, yawning at the crack of dawn. The iron gates creak open to let them in, while impatient commuters shake their fists at the traffic delays.  \n\nThe road intersects with another residential street, where a park and a rehabilitation center stand side-by-side.  The rehabilitation center has a cheerful porch and a lazy ceiling fan that stirs the warm summer air. Kids play in the park, while retirees walk their dogs, occasionally glaring at the teenagers skateboarding by and exchanging knowing glances with the teenage girls huddled around the playground, gossiping about boys and the latest trends.\n\nThere's a strip mall nearby with a sushi place that's always fairly empty, a swimming supply store, and a nail salon -  imagine getting a manicure while stocking up on pool supplies and having some hibachi chicken!  There's even a DIY frozen yogurt shop, where teens often gather, clutching cold cups of sugary goodness as they perform skateboard tricks and vape.\n\nThis neighborhood is a snapshot of Americana - a timeless piece of the South where life moves at a slower pace and change is a rare occurrence.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove past endless cornfields. I knew she'd be stunned by the wide-open spaces.  She came from a town where you could walk to the grocery store in five minutes; she'd never seen anything like this. Overwhelmed by the sea of corn, I told her about growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood who I was and where I came from.\n\nWe turned onto a two-lane road, and soon we passed a quarry filled with water. Just past it was the small development I lived in.  Most of the houses were brick and stucco, each sitting on at least half an acre of land that everyone took pride in keeping up.  Springtime brought a riot of color with planted flowers and the changing leaves of the midwestern trees.

Behind the house, a small stream flowed into the quarry, where we could hear bullfrogs croaking, the water babbling, and the occasional moo from the nearby farms. We crossed a handmade wooden bridge to an untouched oasis filled with trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was where I spent most of my childhood, building tree forts, pretending to hunt (mostly chasing squirrels), and always finding a friend to play with.\n\nWinters in our small town were harsh, but beautiful. The yard transformed from a lush green into a stark wilderness.  Trees that once showcased vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers became bare skeletons of bark. When it snowed, a winter wonderland appeared overnight.  Snow angels adorned the backyard, along with snowmen. My sister and I fought constantly as kids, and snowballs were our weapon of choice.

            "Alright, so you wanna know about Portland, Oregon? First off, you gotta understand what \"weird\" means here. It's not just a label, it's practically the city motto, plastered on some building that somehow manages to be a pizza place, bar, music venue, and strip club all at once.  Some folks see it as a throwback to the good ol' days, back when Portland was a hidden gem, cheaper and more underground. Others, well, they see it as an invitation: come on down, be weird, and we'll celebrate it.\n\nNow, even with all the fancy Californians moving in and condos popping up everywhere, Portland still holds onto its weirdness.  It's not about blindly accepting everything, mind you. We've got our share of modern problems, like everyone else. We buy our stuff from China, have yoga studios and hipsters, and even business types.  Maybe it's just that we take it all a little less seriously.\n\nTake my neighborhood, for example. Our streets are lined with colorful houses, gardens bursting with flowers, herbs, and veggies, and there are these magical things called \"free boxes\" everywhere in the summer.  These boxes, usually cardboard but sometimes plastic bags, are filled with random treasures – clothes, books, who knows what else! It's like a scavenger hunt of possibility.\n\nThat's what Portland is to me: a place where you can be yourself, whatever that might be. But there are a thousand different kinds of weird here. Some folks would never dream of digging through a free box, they're off doing goat yoga or cheering on the Timbers, the city's soccer team.  We've got people who chase their dreams, people who dream about chasing their dreams, and everyone in between.\n\nSure, Portland has its issues – we've got a drug problem, a homelessness problem – things no city seems to have a perfect solution for.  But hey, we're not weird enough to be immune to those.  What we do have is a lot of heart, a lot of creativity, and a whole lot of weirdness.",
            "The mountains are always a constant presence, standing tall to the north. They witness every sunrise and sunset, no matter how busy I get or how much I forget about them. They remain unwavering, unfazed by life's ups and downs. On the days when stress gets the best of me, they seem to call out to me, offering a place of peace and strength. I first fell in love with them when I started college. Sure, the university itself is beautiful, with its buildings, ponds, and trees, but the mountains hold a special place in my heart. The town itself is charming, with countless cafés where I spent countless hours studying, and a bustling downtown area with historical buildings that bring a sense of antiquity. However, just a short walk away, the town reverts back to its peaceful, suburban atmosphere. This blend of energy and serenity is what makes this place so unique. \n\nOver the years, I've created countless memories here, both good and bad. Whether it's walking with friends after an all-nighter, rushing through downtown to catch a movie, or having heartfelt conversations by the ponds, each spot in town holds a story. The ponds, in particular, have been a place for reflection, both joyful and melancholic. \n\nOne day, while feeling lost and uncertain, I found myself walking north, towards the mountains. The sun was shining, illuminating the sky as I looked up. And there they were, standing strong and majestic, reminding me of my ability to persevere.",
            "Alright, so you're thinking of checking out Bensonhurst, Brooklyn? Let me tell you, finding your way around is a breeze, thanks to the city's awesome public transport system. You'll definitely be in the heart of NYC vibes here - it's a pretty urban neighborhood.  \n\nGet ready for a serious dose of Asian culture, because Bensonhurst has become a hub for Asian residents over the past couple of decades.  Seriously, you'll practically bump into an Asian-owned store on every block - supermarkets, laundromats, the works. And local peeps swear by these places, praising the amazing food, super affordable prices, and unbeatable convenience. I'm talking four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk of each other!\n\nBut Bensonhurst isn't just an Asian enclave, it's a melting pot of cultures with immigrants, first-gen, and second-gen Americans all calling it home.  You'll see a mix of businesses, but Asian-owned ones definitely dominate. \n\nOh, and there's this awesome recently renovated park nearby, with tons of basketball courts, a massive field for soccer or baseball, handball courts, a playground, and even a water fountain for the little ones. It's a real testament to NYC's diversity - you'll see people from all walks of life chilling and playing together. \n\nYou won't find any massive corporate buildings here, just co-ops, condos, and a whole lot of two-family houses. The people are generally friendly, but they can get a bit loud.  Think cars blasting music and revving engines - it's not exactly quiet living!\n\nNow, while Bensonhurst is generally safe, it's still New York, so you gotta be street smart, especially at night.  There are always a few unpredictable characters around, and you might encounter some troublemakers. I've had my share of run-ins, including a physical assault a while back (don't worry, it's ancient history!), and package theft is a real issue. \n\nAnd speaking of issues, let's talk about dog poop.  NYC has rules about cleaning up after your furry friends, but nobody seems to follow them in Bensonhurst. Be prepared to dodge landmines on your way to the train or the supermarket. Seriously, it's a constant struggle to keep your shoes clean!",
            "My neighborhood's a bit of a strange place.  It's all hills, really, and my house is perched right at the top of the steepest one - they call it \"workout hill\" because all the joggers love to run up it.  The street itself has no sidewalks, so everyone walks right on the road, which is kind of bumpy and dodgy in spots. The power lines strung up around the place are a mess, always getting hit by branches and looking all patched up from repairs. Rain and storms are pretty common here, so that probably doesn't help. Everywhere you look, there are massive evergreen trees, but everyone seems to hate them. They chop them down whenever they can because they block the view of the ocean. That's why so many houses are built way up on the hill, with huge, glass-fronted second stories to get a glimpse of the bay.  It's pretty amazing at sunset, when the water glows and the sky turns orange.  But it's usually cloudy, so the sun only peeks through in a hazy way most of the time.  It's pretty damp and overcast most days, and moss grows everywhere - even on cars and railings. I once left my car parked for a month, and it ended up covered in green fluff! It took ages to clean it off.  There aren't many kids around here, though there's a school nearby. Mostly, it's older folks, a lot of them retired.  Instead of kids, everyone has dogs – they're constantly running around, and you have to be careful because they'll wander into your house if you leave a door or window open.  I found one in my living room once!  Rabbits are another problem – they're everywhere, and the gardeners hate them because they dig up their plants.  My cats love them though, so they've almost cleared them out.  There are the usual birds too - sparrows, hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle until the crows chase them away.\n\nThere aren't any shops around here, but if you head down to the waterfront, there are a few places that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach, but the rocks along the shore are fun to chuck in the water. The bay isn't very wide – you can easily see the other side, even through the mist.",
            "My neighborhood is pretty typical for a suburb in a small Southern town in Tennessee. It's a connector street between two state highways, so we get more traffic than I'd prefer, but it's mostly quiet.  The people here are pretty familiar, as folks don't move in and out much. You know, the usual neighborhood stuff: yard work, daily chores, kids riding bikes, dogs being walked. We work from home, a family of four: my wife, myself, and our two daughters, eleven and fourteen. We're pretty visible since we're always coming and going, and everyone knows us. We spend a lot of time outdoors, even in the rain.  We grill on the back deck sometimes, filling the air with that barbecue smell. You can practically hear a lawnmower every day from March to October, thanks to all the trees lining the streets. It's a bit of a wooded area, so come fall, there's an abundance of leaves.  That means raking and burning, which I actually enjoy because it means fall has arrived. Lately, we haven't had much of a winter, so it just feels like a long fall. Our garage is at the back, so we mostly use the front door when someone knocks, which isn't often. When I work on projects in the garage, with the doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays are pretty quiet around here, except for Thanksgiving and Mother's Day or Christmas, when relatives come to visit and fill the streets with cars. Overall, I like living here. If it weren't for the through traffic, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is smack-dab in the middle of the high desert. It's all dirt, dirt, and more dirt. You folks who haven't lived here wouldn't get it – the constant brown scenery. When you do see a lawn, you know that person's dropping serious cash on keeping it green. Back in the 90s when I first moved here, the houses were spread out like they were trying to avoid each other.  Now, things are getting a bit more crowded, with new places popping up everywhere.  Honestly, it's starting to feel more like a city every day, though I guess that's happening everywhere.\n\nMost folks here are super friendly, but like any place, you've got your good and bad parts.  My neighborhood is surrounded by really nice older folks, so it's a pretty chill place to live.  Shopping-wise, it's mostly chains like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want something upscale,  you gotta drive a bit. I don't see any Whole Foods or anything like that around here.\n\nLooking around, construction seems to be the biggest industry, probably because there's still so much undeveloped land. It's a bit scary, honestly. I like things the way they are now. I moved away from a big city and I'm not looking to go back. Speaking of construction, that's where I work full-time – I'm a drywall and T-bar installer.\n\nWhat I love about living here is the wildlife. People come to the high desert for all sorts of reasons, but the unique beauty of the desert landscape is definitely a big draw. This harsh environment has created some wild and amazing ecosystems that we need to protect. All of us who live here should take the time to learn about the animals that share our space so we can all get along. My family and I have adapted really well to sharing our home with wildlife. My kids are obsessed with lizards and desert bugs – right now they're outside trying to catch some!\n\nAs for things to do, we've got a few attractions.  Victorville is a pretty cool place for families, offering a different kind of experience. If you're visiting, try to time it with the San Bernardino County Fair – it's a blast!  And just a short drive away, you can check out Wrightwood for some snow-covered mountains and awesome winter sports.  If you're into history and nature, the Victor Valley Museum is a must-see. They've got geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and stuff about the history of the town.",
            "Okay, so when people ask me about my neighborhood, I guess my answer is a little different.  Most folks probably think of houses and yards and all that, but my \"hood\" is actually the college campus I live on. My dorm building is like my tight-knit community, and the whole campus is my extended neighborhood, even if I don't hang out there as much.  \n\nBut hey, even though it's a campus, it still kinda feels like a regular neighborhood. You've got your houses, your people, your shops, and even a park!  \n\nLet's start with the \"houses.\"  Here, there are three main types: apartments, regular houses, and dorm rooms.  Apartments usually have a few people per room, maybe 4 or 6 rooms per floor, and they house about 20 people total. Then there are the actual houses, which are rented out to folks with a connection to the school, mostly alumni.  There aren't that many of these, though, because they're not as efficient. And lastly, there are the classic dorm rooms, which are basically where most of us students live. Two people per room, hundreds of students in each building, you know the drill. \n\nAnd speaking of students, my school is super diverse, and that totally shows in my neighborhood. People from all walks of life live here – different cultures, different ages, the whole shebang.  The staff mostly live in the houses, newer students are in the dorms, and the older ones usually snag apartments. It's a real melting pot!\n\nOf course, there are also shops and a park! We've got all the usual dining spots, plus some school-specific stores for clothes and groceries. Basically, you can find everything you need right here. The park is pretty cool too – a place for everyone to chill out and relax, kept clean and safe by the whole community.",
            "So, I've been living here for about a decade now, so I guess it's time to spill the tea on this hood. When I first moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge, let me tell you, I was a mess. I was bawling my eyes out missing my old stomping grounds and the people I loved. But my parents, bless their hearts, had the best intentions. They wanted a better life for me and my little sis,  a nicer house, a better school, the whole nine yards. You know, the whole \"not ghetto\" vibe.  \n\nIt took a while to adjust, but I eventually made some new friends (and a few frenemies, let's be real).  The only neighbors I really got to know were Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis for a bit. They're like family to me, honestly.  I remember when my fam and I went to Mr. Glen's wedding - he and his wife got hitched again! It was a blast, a real party, and something I hope to experience someday when I'm all settled down and ready to treat my future wife like a queen. \n\nI even snagged Mr. Glen's wife, Ms. Veda's, little white strap when she tossed it! Shame I didn't catch the flowers though. We danced the night away, and I had a great time hanging with Marsharii, one of their daughters. Haven't seen her since, but I hope she's doing well.  \n\nThis neighborhood feels like a labyrinth, but now that I have GPS, I'm finally exploring it more. I've mostly stuck to my usual spots, where I hang out with my buddies Kason and Curtis. We used to be all about video games and just living it up. Sometimes I'd chill in the park, soak in the nature, you know, find my peace. I even bring some sticks from Home Depot and practice my balance, sometimes even my bokken.\n\nThere's a basketball and tennis court too, though I haven't touched those in ages.  Still nice to have them around for when I feel like getting active.  My dad actually got me and my best friend into tennis with Mr. Graves, we had a blast! Those guys were tough, but we always had a good time.\n\nI've had a lot of fun in this neighborhood, man, a ton of memories. These are just a few that stick out.  I have a feeling the best is yet to come!",
            "My digs are pretty sweet because they're a stone's throw from my college.  Mostly apartments, but there are a few decent bars and restaurants that won't break the bank.  One bar just got a fancy new name and jacked up the prices, but the drinks are still decent. The vibe is pretty chill, mostly college kids and people making ends meet, you know? It's a family-friendly neighborhood too, with an elementary school right down the street. I'm not on a first-name basis with my neighbors, and honestly, I'm good with that.  They're a bit...enthusiastic about the herb,  so the building management stuck an air freshener right outside their door. Classic! \n\nMost of the buildings around here are old-school, but some of them have gotten a modern makeover inside. There's a brand new apartment complex down the road, but it's a total scam.  They slapped it together cheap, but the rent is sky-high because it's near campus. The best thing about this neighborhood is the cheap eats. There's this hole-in-the-wall joint that serves everything on paper plates, mostly microwave-able stuff, but it hits the spot. Across the street is a gas station that probably wouldn't be my cup of tea to work at.\n\nBut hey, the city coughed up some cash to redo the road last summer.  Now we've got a swanky new sidewalk, lush greenery everywhere, and the whole place feels a bit classier. My building is tucked away behind a bunch of trees, although they chopped down a few recently.  The streets behind my place are a little rougher. Crumbling sidewalks and buildings that look like they've seen better days.  But hey, at least there are trees to hide it all! Crime mostly seems to be concentrated in one apartment complex on that street, but then again, there’s another one across the street that’s got its share of issues. \n\nOverall, I'm pretty content with my little corner of the world.  It's affordable, close to campus, and has all the essentials. Plus, there are two bus stops that make it easy to get around.",
            "My neighborhood is a charming collection of identical houses, each painted yellow with white porches and green roofs, arranged on a cul-de-sac like individual dwellings. They're spaced out just enough to look like stand-alone homes, but most of the residents know each other.  We often gather at the end of driveways, catching up while the kids play outside, a heartwarming scene in this increasingly digital world. It feels like stepping back in time, surrounded by fields, trees, and endless blue skies dotted with fluffy clouds.\n\nThe only downside? We've been dealing with tornado warnings lately, and last night, we actually heard the sirens.  I found myself scrambling for shelter in the bathtub with my little dog, clutching my purse and some pillows. My big guy, though, wasn't keen on sharing the bathroom and stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The neighborhood was eerily quiet except for the pounding hail.  After the storm passed, the roads steamed from the rapid temperature change, the hail melting instantly on the hot pavement.\n\nAs the skies cleared, a double rainbow appeared! I grabbed my camera and snapped some pictures to share with everyone on Facebook – they were just as amazed as I was.  Everyone stayed inside for a while, then slowly trickled back out, resuming our usual evening routine. It's a truly friendly place, especially for a transplant like myself, who recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I love the Southern accents and the close-knit community feel. \n\nWe all live in identical two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartments, though the insides vary. Some are surprisingly small! I enjoy walking through the big field behind my place down to the pond (though no swimming allowed). I've spotted deer roaming around and hear a giant bullfrog croaking every morning. It's a fantastic place to live, just forty minutes outside Charlotte. We're awakened each morning by the sound of roosters crowing from nearby farms, like living in a tiny village.  There's even a donkey at a nearby farm that brays in the evenings, letting us know he's around. I feel incredibly lucky to have found this hidden gem of a neighborhood.",
            "I moved into this neighborhood right before eighth grade, and making friends was tough at first. I eventually became close with a couple of guys, one who lived just a couple of houses down and another on my street. They've both moved on since then, but the memories we made are still there. Most of the people who were here when I first arrived are still around. It's your typical American suburb, with lots of two-story houses.  On weekends or any day the weather's nice, you can always hear kids playing outside. Things are pretty quiet most of the time. I've never had any problems with the neighbors – people tend to keep to themselves unless you need something. I've ordered stuff online without worrying about porch pirates, so I definitely feel safe here. \n\nThere's a park just a few minutes from my place that's loaded with memories. I played basketball, football, and baseball with the neighborhood guys there. I even got elbowed in the nose during a football game – one of my worst memories tied to that park! But the good times definitely outweigh the bad. Nowadays, I mostly go to the park to hang out with my cousin's kids. They're way younger than me, still excited about swings and slides. Just thinking about the park takes me back.\n\nThe neighborhood is pretty diverse, with all kinds of food options within a short distance. You can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants all within a mile.  Of course, a lot of people just order in through apps like GrubHub and DoorDash these days. The usual suspects – fast food joints – are around, but you'd find those in any suburb. There are plenty of pizza places too. The stores here have everything you could need. There are a couple of dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and even a Jewel-Osco grocery store. And there's even an Indian-owned store if you're craving some homemade or ready-made Indian food.\n\nOverall, I really like my neighborhood. Seeing the crazy stuff some people deal with in their neighborhoods on social media and the news makes me appreciate mine even more.",
            "My town, Johnston, is pretty typical for South Carolina. It ain't flashy, but it's got a big heart, especially when it comes to peaches.  They call themselves the \"Peach Capital of the World,\" and you'll see it plastered on the welcome sign.  Most of the town is just farmland, either bursting with peach trees or filled with grazing cattle.  \n\nHouses are spread out, mostly two-story affairs with metal roofs to beat the summer heat or gray shingles.  You won't find them right on the road; they're usually tucked back, giving the front yard space for animals or crops. The town center is small, with just one stoplight at the crossroads.  That's where you'll find all the shops, too.  \n\nHungry?  You've got three choices for \"fast food\": Hong Kong, a family-run Chinese joint, Fiesta for Mexican, and Gary's, a local burger chain.  Used to be a pizza place, but it shut down a while back.  Maxwell and Halford Drug is the local pharmacy, and they're famous for their Cherry Coca-Cola.  Then there's IGA, the only grocery store, but it's pricey, so most folks head to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for their main grocery haul.  The real star of the town is Dollar General. It's packed all day long, selling everything you could need.\n\nThere's a small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a sweetheart of a woman.  It's been around forever and even has two movers who'll deliver your new sofa!  Attached to the furniture store is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, where they take care of your furry friends with daycare, boarding, grooming, and all that good stuff.\n\nThe doctor and vet are out in the countryside, small practices but well-equipped.  There's a single elementary school, Johnston Elementary, but once kids finish fifth grade, they go to middle and high school in the next town.  \n\nJohnston doesn't have any parks, but they're trying to build a little recreation area.  It's pretty quiet here, no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or places to hang out.  Not much to do, really.  But it's a nice, cozy town, the kind you could miss if you blink.",
            "The first time I heard about my apartment building, it was on a podcast about missing persons. It was a bit of a shock, since most apartments in the area went for over a thousand dollars a month. None of my friends had ever heard of this story either. Maybe it's the struggle, I thought. I know some of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've gotten pretty good at being frugal over the years. You start to appreciate the musty scent of flea market toys and clothes that have been tucked away for a while. You don't smell as much as an adult. You might pick up smoking, or maybe it's just getting used to the way things are. But the flea market always pulls you back in. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines piled on a closed piano. It seeps into the leather and stays there even after you wash it.  \n\nHere, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start on one side, you can hit up two charity shops, a library, a rare books store, and a quirky little shop selling all sorts of odds and ends. Downtown is packed with cars and people every morning, but you'd never hear it inside the thrift stores.  No matter how many people or cars pass by, it's always quiet. It's a great place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there are more and more of these types of places popping up. Cars and people flood the streets. It's a growing city, they say. With one of the biggest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still going through growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone here is focused on their own goals, and no one really asks much of you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where showing even a little concern means you care a lot. People here don't pry into each other's lives. You can keep your distance as long as you want, and the city will keep moving like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be.\n\nBetween the pianist next door and the two amateur singers upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment full of strangers and more of a community of friends. We come together to celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other out when we need it. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I really like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I try to be respectful, clean up after myself, and leave them food, and they do the same for me. I bring them their mail, and they bring mine. It's nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my company as much as I do theirs. I live in a huge, impersonal modernist sprawl, but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't completely screw up my life.",
            "My hood is straight-up suburbia, like the kind you see in movies. You know, the one with the homeowner's association that's got everyone doing the same thing. As soon as you drive in, it's all manicured lawns, identical houses, and those super short driveways.  Everyone's got a two-car garage and the roads are pristine – no potholes in sight. I guess that's what you get when you've got a HOA breathing down your neck.\n\nMost houses are single-story, but you'll see a few two-story ones sprinkled in.  We don't have those regular mailboxes you'd expect. It's more like an apartment setup, with a big bank of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone's got their own key, and there are even giant lockers for packages. Again, thanks, HOA!\n\nLiving on the edge of the city, it's kinda a mix of suburbia and country. We've got tons of space, which means multiple community pools that everyone can use. They're gated and super clean. Plus, there are walking trails everywhere – perfect for taking your dog for a walk or just getting some fresh air.\n\nMost of the neighbors are retirees. It's a really safe place, and everyone looks out for each other. We also have a few middle-aged and young professionals mixed in.\n\nThe city itself is pretty big, but it has a small-town vibe. We've got all the essentials – like one mall, which isn't huge, but gets the job done. It takes about 15 minutes to get there, but once you're there, you've got all kinds of stores, from fancy organic grocery stores to bargain outlets.\n\nOverall, my neighborhood is pretty typical – safe, well-kept, and predictable. We've got nice amenities like pools and trails, and while we're not right next to any major shopping centers, a quick drive gets you there.",
            "I call this little Midwestern town home. It's just outside the sprawling suburbs of a big city. My neighborhood, on the east side, is the less affluent part of town.  The houses here are mostly rentals or owned by folks who aren't rolling in dough. It's not a bad place, though.  My neighbors are generally friendly, always waving and saying hello. Crime isn't exactly low, it's a bit higher than in other parts of town, but not by much.  There have been a couple of shootings and even a homicide a few blocks away in the past ten years.  It hit home when our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a bar last year. Luckily, our family hasn't been directly affected by crime, except maybe the occasional missing item from our porch if we forget to bring it in.\n\nThe whole town, like a lot of places, has been struggling with the opioid epidemic.  Sadly, there have been some lives lost to fentanyl overdoses. But there are good things happening too. There are addiction recovery centers and Narcan training programs for families and friends, helping folks fight this problem.\n\nDespite the challenges, there are plenty of good things about this town. My son loves his elementary school. The principal, teachers, and support staff are all fantastic. He hasn't faced any bullying, even though he has special needs, because the school has such a positive atmosphere. The PTO is super active, organizing events throughout the year to get families involved and support the kids' learning.  Since over 20% of the town lives below the poverty line, the school provides free breakfast and lunch to all the students so no kid ever goes hungry.  No one is made to feel less than because they can't afford things. School fees, supplies, and field trips are also very reasonable.\n\nThe City Council has been working hard to improve the town, fixing roads, adding landscaping, and sprucing up the parks.  Most of these improvements seem to be happening in the downtown area and on the west side, where most of the shops and traffic are. The east side, where I live, tends to get left behind, which is frustrating for folks like me.\n\nAll in all, I'm happy living here. The people are friendly, the schools are great, there are plenty of places to shop, and our house might not be worth much, but it's comfy and we have everything we need. We've been here for over 16 years, and it feels like home.",
            "My neighborhood's got this crazy vibe, you know?  It's perched on a hill, surrounded by buildings with stories etched into their walls.  I live in a seven-story apartment building right across from this old theater, and just down the street is this awesome arcade bar that draws in all kinds of people on warm summer nights.  Especially in June and July, you'll see lines of folks waiting to get in, especially on weekends.  A few blocks up is a park, surprisingly big for this part of town. It's walled in with concrete and has these massive steps built right into it. During the winter, when it gets freezing, you'll see homeless folks setting up their tents in rows along the sidewalk and those steps. It doesn't snow much here, but the winter rains are brutal, and huddled together in the city center keeps them warmer than out in the open. Plus, they're close to the only family center for miles, where they can shower and wash up.\n\nBut the coolest thing about my city isn't the history, the grand buildings, or the architecture spilling down the hills towards the ocean.  What gets me is the people. Hilltop, where I live, used to be known for gang violence, the toughest place on the West Coast. Even now, thirty years later, you hear stories about cops and the DEA cracking down, trying to clean things up.  The people here remember.  These stories get passed down through generations, even to newcomers like me. \n\nDespite the rough reputation it still has, they work hard to keep the neighborhood clean and care about what's happening on their streets. You hear folks say white people shouldn't walk around Hilltop after dark.  I think that's just old history clinging on, a bitter taste of prejudice. Maybe it's because I'm brown enough to blend in, or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of them, someone who gets it, who sees the reminders of racism and assumptions everywhere, even in a city that's supposed to be a melting pot. \n\nWhatever it is, I know I'm home here. Walking those streets at night, meeting people who are more likely to offer you a jacket than rob you, that's real life. It's the laundromat owner who waits a few extra minutes so you can charge your phone when you're trapped by the rain.  It's the stranger who sees you huddled against a store front on a dark night, looks you in the eye, hands you five bucks, and tells you you're beautiful and valuable. That's Hilltop.",
            "I live in small-town Michigan, the type of place where farmland gives way to charming tourist spots. You won't find any big-city chains like malls, Wal-Mart, Target, or even an Applebee's here.  Getting around means hopping in the car, but it's worth it because I live in one of the most beautiful places imaginable, surrounded by glistening water on all sides. \n\nLake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix frame my \"city,\" making it easy to find a beach for a quick dip. My neighborhood is pure small-town charm. Houses aren't crammed together, they're individual, with some updated and others proudly sporting their vintage character.  Most have full basements visible from the street, and you'll see a rainbow of colors in the aluminum siding, each house boasting a unique personality.\n\nMost yards feature trampolines, playsets, and gardens, with some even housing fences for furry friends. These homes embody the hardworking spirit of Middle America - families raising kids or enjoying the fruits of their labor. It's a place where kids play freely on the streets, you'll see neighbors chatting over fences, and dogs getting their daily exercise.  There's a genuine sense of community, where everyone knows each other, and if you're new in town, you'll quickly learn who's who.\n\nThe lawns are well-maintained, a testament to local pride.  It's not a neighborhood that screams luxury, but rather one that whispers, \"This is a safe and welcoming place to raise a family.\" It's quiet, peaceful, and safe.\n\nEven within walking distance are essential services like the sheriff's department, jail, health department, and recycling center, all contributing to the practical convenience of small-town life.  You can hear the thrill of baseball games from nearby fields, with the nearby airport adding a touch of adventure with the rumble of small planes taking off and landing. A local ice cream shop is just a short stroll away, and a bike ride takes you to a nearby park."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

These boutiques aren't just in malls, either; they're lining the streets, making even quiet neighborhoods feel like hubs of activity.\n\nOh, and did I mention the parks?  They're scattered around, and I see families with kids hanging out there all the time. Speaking of people, my neighborhood is a real mix.

To be honest, I don't even know most of my neighbors. It's not the tight-knit community it used to be, which I kind of miss.

            "My neighborhood is a fascinating mix of old and new. Most houses are single-family homes, but some have been cleverly divided into two units while staying connected. My place has a small front yard and a tiny driveway, typical of the suburban dream that still lingers here. It feels like a snapshot of a past era when this type of living was the epitome of the American ideal. While that dream may be fading for some, my neighborhood holds onto it tightly.\n\nThe residents aren't as optimistic as they once were; the yards aren't as meticulously kept, but the driveways still boast a couple of cars, and the kids still play with an infectious energy, treating the world as their own playground. The local public school, a landmark for almost 90 years, stands strong, inspiring hope in the young and evoking nostalgia in the older folks. Churches are scarce, often empty, but the basketball courts buzz with activity. The houses may look different, but they share a similar soul.\n\nThere's a large supermarket named Super \"A,\" owned by a Yemeni family who are likely the only Arab families in the neighborhood. Most residents are African American, and the streets are wide enough for kids to play football, pausing only to let cars pass. Many families have lived here for generations, reminiscing about a time when everyone knew everyone. A former karate school, now a pharmacy, stands as a reminder of how quickly trends change. The kids lost interest when Hollywood stopped churning out \"Karate Kid\" movies, apparently opting for quick fixes instead.\n\nA small, independent movie theatre screens classic films at affordable prices, catering to older residents who appreciate a night out without the hustle and bustle of modern cinemas. The younger generation, however, prefers newer releases and shuns the theatre's vintage offerings.\n\nAn expressway cuts through our town, but its entrance and exit are just across the border in the neighboring town. Once, there was a strong push to build an exit in our town, supported by the younger generation, but opposed by the older residents who feared it would disrupt the neighborhood's tranquility. They ultimately prevailed, persuading the city council to deny the petition.\n\nNow, a new high school is under construction, and the town is debating its mascot.  I believe a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would perfectly encapsulate the unique spirit of my hometown.",
            "This neighborhood might seem unremarkable at first glance - it's tucked behind a shopping strip, not exactly the kind of place you'd expect to find hidden communities.

The first complex has a bit of a bad reputation - let's just say appearances can be deceiving.

She came from a town where you could walk to the grocery store in five minutes; she'd never seen anything like this. Overwhelmed by the sea of corn, I told her about growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood who I was and where I came from.\n\nWe turned onto a two-lane road, and soon we passed a quarry filled with water. Just past it was the small development I lived in.  Most of the houses were brick and stucco, each sitting on at least half an acre of land that everyone took pride in keeping up.  Springtime brought a riot of color with planted flowers and the changing leaves of the midwestern trees. The driveways were filled with gleaming Mercedes-Benz luxury cars, sparkling after a good wash.\n\nAs we continued down the road towards my grey stucco house, I saw my Korean neighbor outside, his friendly face always a welcome sight. He spent his days mowing his lawn, his singing blending with the hum of the mower. Everyone in the neighborhood chuckled at him, but he was a genuinely kind person with a fascinating past. He'd been a doctor before, and these days he blended in with the grass and his John Deere Zero Turn mower.\n\nFinally, we reached my house. Geese grazed in the side yard, chased by our terrier. Behind the house, a small stream flowed into the quarry, where we could hear bullfrogs croaking, the water babbling, and the occasional moo from the nearby farms. We crossed a handmade wooden bridge to an untouched oasis filled with trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was where I spent most of my childhood, building tree forts, pretending to hunt (mostly chasing squirrels), and always finding a friend to play with.\n\nWinters in our small town were harsh, but beautiful. The yard transformed from a lush green into a stark wilderness.  Trees that once showcased vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers became bare skeletons of bark. When it snowed, a winter wonderland appeared overnight.  Snow angels adorned the backyard, along with snowmen. My sister and I fought constantly as kids, and snowballs were our weapon of choice.  We built massive igloo-like forts to store our branches, like an arsenal. In our own little winter kingdom, we played pretend, forgetting everything else. We were just kids, carefree and full of life.",
            "Alright, so you wanna know about Portland, Oregon? First off, you gotta understand what \"weird\" means here. It's not just a label, it's practically the city motto, plastered on some building that somehow manages to be a pizza place, bar, music venue, and strip club all at once.  Some folks see it as a throwback to the good ol' days, back when Portland was a hidden gem, cheaper and more underground. Others, well, they see it as an invitation: come on down, be weird, and we'll celebrate it.\n\nNow, even with all the fancy Californians moving in and condos popping up everywhere, Portland still holds onto its weirdness.  It's not about blindly accepting everything, mind you. We've got our share of modern problems, like everyone else. We buy our stuff from China, have yoga studios and hipsters, and even business types.  Maybe it's just that we take it all a little less seriously.\n\nTake my neighborhood, for example. Our streets are lined with colorful houses, gardens bursting with flowers, herbs, and veggies, and there are these magical things called \"free boxes\" everywhere in the summer.  These boxes, usually cardboard but sometimes plastic bags, are filled with random treasures – clothes, books, who knows what else! It's like a scavenger hunt of possibility.\n\nThat's what Portland is to me: a place where you can be yourself, whatever that might be. But there are a thousand different kinds of weird here. Some folks would never dream of digging through a free box, they're off doing goat yoga or cheering on the Timbers, the city's soccer team.  We've got people who chase their dreams, people who dream about chasing their dreams, and everyone in between.\n\nSure, Portland has its issues – we've got a drug problem, a homelessness problem – things no city seems to have a perfect solution for.  But hey, we're not weird enough to be immune to those.  What we do have is a lot of heart, a lot of creativity, and a whole lot of weirdness.",
            "The mountains are always a constant presence, standing tall to the north. They witness every sunrise and sunset, no matter how busy I get or how much I forget about them. They remain unwavering, unfazed by life's ups and downs. On the days when stress gets the best of me, they seem to call out to me, offering a place of peace and strength. I first fell in love with them when I started college. Sure, the university itself is beautiful, with its buildings, ponds, and trees, but the mountains hold a special place in my heart. The town itself is charming, with countless cafés where I spent countless hours studying, and a bustling downtown area with historical buildings that bring a sense of antiquity. However, just a short walk away, the town reverts back to its peaceful, suburban atmosphere. This blend of energy and serenity is what makes this place so unique. \n\nOver the years, I've created countless memories here, both good and bad. Whether it's walking with friends after an all-nighter, rushing through downtown to catch a movie, or having heartfelt conversations by the ponds, each spot in town holds a story. The ponds, in particular, have been a place for reflection, both joyful and melancholic. \n\nOne day, while feeling lost and uncertain, I found myself walking north, towards the mountains. The sun was shining, illuminating the sky as I looked up. And there they were, standing strong and majestic, reminding me of my ability to persevere.",
            "Alright, so you're thinking of checking out Bensonhurst, Brooklyn? Let me tell you, finding your way around is a breeze, thanks to the city's awesome public transport system. You'll definitely be in the heart of NYC vibes here - it's a pretty urban neighborhood.  \n\nGet ready for a serious dose of Asian culture, because Bensonhurst has become a hub for Asian residents over the past couple of decades.  Seriously, you'll practically bump into an Asian-owned store on every block - supermarkets, laundromats, the works. And local peeps swear by these places, praising the amazing food, super affordable prices, and unbeatable convenience. I'm talking four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk of each other!\n\nBut Bensonhurst isn't just an Asian enclave, it's a melting pot of cultures with immigrants, first-gen, and second-gen Americans all calling it home.  You'll see a mix of businesses, but Asian-owned ones definitely dominate. \n\nOh, and there's this awesome recently renovated park nearby, with tons of basketball courts, a massive field for soccer or baseball, handball courts, a playground, and even a water fountain for the little ones. It's a real testament to NYC's diversity - you'll see people from all walks of life chilling and playing together. \n\nYou won't find any massive corporate buildings here, just co-ops, condos, and a whole lot of two-family houses. The people are generally friendly, but they can get a bit loud.  Think cars blasting music and revving engines - it's not exactly quiet living!\n\nNow, while Bensonhurst is generally safe, it's still New York, so you gotta be street smart, especially at night.  There are always a few unpredictable characters around, and you might encounter some troublemakers. I've had my share of run-ins, including a physical assault a while back (don't worry, it's ancient history!), and package theft is a real issue. \n\nAnd speaking of issues, let's talk about dog poop.  NYC has rules about cleaning up after your furry friends, but nobody seems to follow them in Bensonhurst. Be prepared to dodge landmines on your way to the train or the supermarket. Seriously, it's a constant struggle to keep your shoes clean!",
            "My neighborhood's a bit of a strange place.  It's all hills, really, and my house is perched right at the top of the steepest one - they call it \"workout hill\" because all the joggers love to run up it.  The street itself has no sidewalks, so everyone walks right on the road, which is kind of bumpy and dodgy in spots. The power lines strung up around the place are a mess, always getting hit by branches and looking all patched up from repairs. Rain and storms are pretty common here, so that probably doesn't help. Everywhere you look, there are massive evergreen trees, but everyone seems to hate them. They chop them down whenever they can because they block the view of the ocean. That's why so many houses are built way up on the hill, with huge, glass-fronted second stories to get a glimpse of the bay.  It's pretty amazing at sunset, when the water glows and the sky turns orange.  But it's usually cloudy, so the sun only peeks through in a hazy way most of the time.  It's pretty damp and overcast most days, and moss grows everywhere - even on cars and railings. I once left my car parked for a month, and it ended up covered in green fluff! It took ages to clean it off.  There aren't many kids around here, though there's a school nearby. Mostly, it's older folks, a lot of them retired.  Instead of kids, everyone has dogs – they're constantly running around, and you have to be careful because they'll wander into your house if you leave a door or window open.  I found one in my living room once!  Rabbits are another problem – they're everywhere, and the gardeners hate them because they dig up their plants.  My cats love them though, so they've almost cleared them out.  There are the usual birds too - sparrows, hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle until the crows chase them away.\n\nThere aren't any shops around here, but if you head down to the waterfront, there are a few places that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach, but the rocks along the shore are fun to chuck in the water. The bay isn't very wide – you can easily see the other side, even through the mist.",
            "My neighborhood is pretty typical for a suburb in a small Southern town in Tennessee. It's a connector street between two state highways, so we get more traffic than I'd prefer, but it's mostly quiet.  The people here are pretty familiar, as folks don't move in and out much. You know, the usual neighborhood stuff: yard work, daily chores, kids riding bikes, dogs being walked. We work from home, a family of four: my wife, myself, and our two daughters, eleven and fourteen. We're pretty visible since we're always coming and going, and everyone knows us. We spend a lot of time outdoors, even in the rain.  We grill on the back deck sometimes, filling the air with that barbecue smell. You can practically hear a lawnmower every day from March to October, thanks to all the trees lining the streets. It's a bit of a wooded area, so come fall, there's an abundance of leaves.  That means raking and burning, which I actually enjoy because it means fall has arrived. Lately, we haven't had much of a winter, so it just feels like a long fall. Our garage is at the back, so we mostly use the front door when someone knocks, which isn't often. When I work on projects in the garage, with the doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays are pretty quiet around here, except for Thanksgiving and Mother's Day or Christmas, when relatives come to visit and fill the streets with cars. Overall, I like living here. If it weren't for the through traffic, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is smack-dab in the middle of the high desert. It's all dirt, dirt, and more dirt. You folks who haven't lived here wouldn't get it – the constant brown scenery. When you do see a lawn, you know that person's dropping serious cash on keeping it green. Back in the 90s when I first moved here, the houses were spread out like they were trying to avoid each other.  Now, things are getting a bit more crowded, with new places popping up everywhere.  Honestly, it's starting to feel more like a city every day, though I guess that's happening everywhere.\n\nMost folks here are super friendly, but like any place, you've got your good and bad parts.  My neighborhood is surrounded by really nice older folks, so it's a pretty chill place to live.  Shopping-wise, it's mostly chains like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want something upscale,  you gotta drive a bit. I don't see any Whole Foods or anything like that around here.\n\nLooking around, construction seems to be the biggest industry, probably because there's still so much undeveloped land. It's a bit scary, honestly. I like things the way they are now. I moved away from a big city and I'm not looking to go back. Speaking of construction, that's where I work full-time – I'm a drywall and T-bar installer.\n\nWhat I love about living here is the wildlife. People come to the high desert for all sorts of reasons, but the unique beauty of the desert landscape is definitely a big draw. This harsh environment has created some wild and amazing ecosystems that we need to protect. All of us who live here should take the time to learn about the animals that share our space so we can all get along. My family and I have adapted really well to sharing our home with wildlife. My kids are obsessed with lizards and desert bugs – right now they're outside trying to catch some!\n\nAs for things to do, we've got a few attractions.  Victorville is a pretty cool place for families, offering a different kind of experience. If you're visiting, try to time it with the San Bernardino County Fair – it's a blast!  And just a short drive away, you can check out Wrightwood for some snow-covered mountains and awesome winter sports.  If you're into history and nature, the Victor Valley Museum is a must-see. They've got geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and stuff about the history of the town.",
            "Okay, so when people ask me about my neighborhood, I guess my answer is a little different.  Most folks probably think of houses and yards and all that, but my \"hood\" is actually the college campus I live on. My dorm building is like my tight-knit community, and the whole campus is my extended neighborhood, even if I don't hang out there as much.  \n\nBut hey, even though it's a campus, it still kinda feels like a regular neighborhood. You've got your houses, your people, your shops, and even a park!  \n\nLet's start with the \"houses.\"  Here, there are three main types: apartments, regular houses, and dorm rooms.  Apartments usually have a few people per room, maybe 4 or 6 rooms per floor, and they house about 20 people total. Then there are the actual houses, which are rented out to folks with a connection to the school, mostly alumni.  There aren't that many of these, though, because they're not as efficient. And lastly, there are the classic dorm rooms, which are basically where most of us students live. Two people per room, hundreds of students in each building, you know the drill. \n\nAnd speaking of students, my school is super diverse, and that totally shows in my neighborhood. People from all walks of life live here – different cultures, different ages, the whole shebang.  The staff mostly live in the houses, newer students are in the dorms, and the older ones usually snag apartments. It's a real melting pot!\n\nOf course, there are also shops and a park! We've got all the usual dining spots, plus some school-specific stores for clothes and groceries. Basically, you can find everything you need right here. The park is pretty cool too – a place for everyone to chill out and relax, kept clean and safe by the whole community.",
            "So, I've been living here for about a decade now, so I guess it's time to spill the tea on this hood. When I first moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge, let me tell you, I was a mess. I was bawling my eyes out missing my old stomping grounds and the people I loved. But my parents, bless their hearts, had the best intentions. They wanted a better life for me and my little sis,  a nicer house, a better school, the whole nine yards. You know, the whole \"not ghetto\" vibe.  \n\nIt took a while to adjust, but I eventually made some new friends (and a few frenemies, let's be real).  The only neighbors I really got to know were Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis for a bit. They're like family to me, honestly.  I remember when my fam and I went to Mr. Glen's wedding - he and his wife got hitched again! It was a blast, a real party, and something I hope to experience someday when I'm all settled down and ready to treat my future wife like a queen. \n\nI even snagged Mr. Glen's wife, Ms. Veda's, little white strap when she tossed it! Shame I didn't catch the flowers though. We danced the night away, and I had a great time hanging with Marsharii, one of their daughters. Haven't seen her since, but I hope she's doing well.  \n\nThis neighborhood feels like a labyrinth, but now that I have GPS, I'm finally exploring it more. I've mostly stuck to my usual spots, where I hang out with my buddies Kason and Curtis. We used to be all about video games and just living it up. Sometimes I'd chill in the park, soak in the nature, you know, find my peace. I even bring some sticks from Home Depot and practice my balance, sometimes even my bokken.\n\nThere's a basketball and tennis court too, though I haven't touched those in ages.  Still nice to have them around for when I feel like getting active.  My dad actually got me and my best friend into tennis with Mr. Graves, we had a blast! Those guys were tough, but we always had a good time.\n\nI've had a lot of fun in this neighborhood, man, a ton of memories. These are just a few that stick out.  I have a feeling the best is yet to come!",
            "My digs are pretty sweet because they're a stone's throw from my college.  Mostly apartments, but there are a few decent bars and restaurants that won't break the bank.  One bar just got a fancy new name and jacked up the prices, but the drinks are still decent. The vibe is pretty chill, mostly college kids and people making ends meet, you know? It's a family-friendly neighborhood too, with an elementary school right down the street. I'm not on a first-name basis with my neighbors, and honestly, I'm good with that.  They're a bit...enthusiastic about the herb,  so the building management stuck an air freshener right outside their door. Classic! \n\nMost of the buildings around here are old-school, but some of them have gotten a modern makeover inside. There's a brand new apartment complex down the road, but it's a total scam.  They slapped it together cheap, but the rent is sky-high because it's near campus. The best thing about this neighborhood is the cheap eats. There's this hole-in-the-wall joint that serves everything on paper plates, mostly microwave-able stuff, but it hits the spot. Across the street is a gas station that probably wouldn't be my cup of tea to work at.\n\nBut hey, the city coughed up some cash to redo the road last summer.  Now we've got a swanky new sidewalk, lush greenery everywhere, and the whole place feels a bit classier. My building is tucked away behind a bunch of trees, although they chopped down a few recently.  The streets behind my place are a little rougher. Crumbling sidewalks and buildings that look like they've seen better days.  But hey, at least there are trees to hide it all! Crime mostly seems to be concentrated in one apartment complex on that street, but then again, there’s another one across the street that’s got its share of issues. \n\nOverall, I'm pretty content with my little corner of the world.  It's affordable, close to campus, and has all the essentials. Plus, there are two bus stops that make it easy to get around.",
            "My neighborhood is a charming collection of identical houses, each painted yellow with white porches and green roofs, arranged on a cul-de-sac like individual dwellings. They're spaced out just enough to look like stand-alone homes, but most of the residents know each other.  We often gather at the end of driveways, catching up while the kids play outside, a heartwarming scene in this increasingly digital world. It feels like stepping back in time, surrounded by fields, trees, and endless blue skies dotted with fluffy clouds.\n\nThe only downside? We've been dealing with tornado warnings lately, and last night, we actually heard the sirens.  I found myself scrambling for shelter in the bathtub with my little dog, clutching my purse and some pillows. My big guy, though, wasn't keen on sharing the bathroom and stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The neighborhood was eerily quiet except for the pounding hail.  After the storm passed, the roads steamed from the rapid temperature change, the hail melting instantly on the hot pavement.\n\nAs the skies cleared, a double rainbow appeared! I grabbed my camera and snapped some pictures to share with everyone on Facebook – they were just as amazed as I was.  Everyone stayed inside for a while, then slowly trickled back out, resuming our usual evening routine. It's a truly friendly place, especially for a transplant like myself, who recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I love the Southern accents and the close-knit community feel. \n\nWe all live in identical two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartments, though the insides vary. Some are surprisingly small! I enjoy walking through the big field behind my place down to the pond (though no swimming allowed). I've spotted deer roaming around and hear a giant bullfrog croaking every morning. It's a fantastic place to live, just forty minutes outside Charlotte. We're awakened each morning by the sound of roosters crowing from nearby farms, like living in a tiny village.  There's even a donkey at a nearby farm that brays in the evenings, letting us know he's around. I feel incredibly lucky to have found this hidden gem of a neighborhood.",
            "I moved into this neighborhood right before eighth grade, and making friends was tough at first. I eventually became close with a couple of guys, one who lived just a couple of houses down and another on my street. They've both moved on since then, but the memories we made are still there. Most of the people who were here when I first arrived are still around. It's your typical American suburb, with lots of two-story houses.  On weekends or any day the weather's nice, you can always hear kids playing outside. Things are pretty quiet most of the time. I've never had any problems with the neighbors – people tend to keep to themselves unless you need something. I've ordered stuff online without worrying about porch pirates, so I definitely feel safe here. \n\nThere's a park just a few minutes from my place that's loaded with memories. I played basketball, football, and baseball with the neighborhood guys there. I even got elbowed in the nose during a football game – one of my worst memories tied to that park! But the good times definitely outweigh the bad. Nowadays, I mostly go to the park to hang out with my cousin's kids. They're way younger than me, still excited about swings and slides. Just thinking about the park takes me back.\n\nThe neighborhood is pretty diverse, with all kinds of food options within a short distance. You can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants all within a mile.  Of course, a lot of people just order in through apps like GrubHub and DoorDash these days. The usual suspects – fast food joints – are around, but you'd find those in any suburb. There are plenty of pizza places too. The stores here have everything you could need. There are a couple of dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and even a Jewel-Osco grocery store. And there's even an Indian-owned store if you're craving some homemade or ready-made Indian food.\n\nOverall, I really like my neighborhood. Seeing the crazy stuff some people deal with in their neighborhoods on social media and the news makes me appreciate mine even more.",
            "My town, Johnston, is pretty typical for South Carolina. It ain't flashy, but it's got a big heart, especially when it comes to peaches.  They call themselves the \"Peach Capital of the World,\" and you'll see it plastered on the welcome sign.  Most of the town is just farmland, either bursting with peach trees or filled with grazing cattle.  \n\nHouses are spread out, mostly two-story affairs with metal roofs to beat the summer heat or gray shingles.  You won't find them right on the road; they're usually tucked back, giving the front yard space for animals or crops. The town center is small, with just one stoplight at the crossroads.  That's where you'll find all the shops, too.  \n\nHungry?  You've got three choices for \"fast food\": Hong Kong, a family-run Chinese joint, Fiesta for Mexican, and Gary's, a local burger chain.  Used to be a pizza place, but it shut down a while back.  Maxwell and Halford Drug is the local pharmacy, and they're famous for their Cherry Coca-Cola.  Then there's IGA, the only grocery store, but it's pricey, so most folks head to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for their main grocery haul.  The real star of the town is Dollar General. It's packed all day long, selling everything you could need.\n\nThere's a small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a sweetheart of a woman.  It's been around forever and even has two movers who'll deliver your new sofa!  Attached to the furniture store is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, where they take care of your furry friends with daycare, boarding, grooming, and all that good stuff.\n\nThe doctor and vet are out in the countryside, small practices but well-equipped.  There's a single elementary school, Johnston Elementary, but once kids finish fifth grade, they go to middle and high school in the next town.  \n\nJohnston doesn't have any parks, but they're trying to build a little recreation area.  It's pretty quiet here, no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or places to hang out.  Not much to do, really.  But it's a nice, cozy town, the kind you could miss if you blink.",
            "The first time I heard about my apartment building, it was on a podcast about missing persons. It was a bit of a shock, since most apartments in the area went for over a thousand dollars a month. None of my friends had ever heard of this story either. Maybe it's the struggle, I thought. I know some of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've gotten pretty good at being frugal over the years. You start to appreciate the musty scent of flea market toys and clothes that have been tucked away for a while. You don't smell as much as an adult. You might pick up smoking, or maybe it's just getting used to the way things are. But the flea market always pulls you back in. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines piled on a closed piano. It seeps into the leather and stays there even after you wash it.  \n\nHere, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start on one side, you can hit up two charity shops, a library, a rare books store, and a quirky little shop selling all sorts of odds and ends. Downtown is packed with cars and people every morning, but you'd never hear it inside the thrift stores.  No matter how many people or cars pass by, it's always quiet. It's a great place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there are more and more of these types of places popping up. Cars and people flood the streets. It's a growing city, they say. With one of the biggest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still going through growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone here is focused on their own goals, and no one really asks much of you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where showing even a little concern means you care a lot. People here don't pry into each other's lives. You can keep your distance as long as you want, and the city will keep moving like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be.\n\nBetween the pianist next door and the two amateur singers upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment full of strangers and more of a community of friends. We come together to celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other out when we need it. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I really like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I try to be respectful, clean up after myself, and leave them food, and they do the same for me. I bring them their mail, and they bring mine. It's nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my company as much as I do theirs. I live in a huge, impersonal modernist sprawl, but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't completely screw up my life.",
            "My hood is straight-up suburbia, like the kind you see in movies. You know, the one with the homeowner's association that's got everyone doing the same thing. As soon as you drive in, it's all manicured lawns, identical houses, and those super short driveways.  Everyone's got a two-car garage and the roads are pristine – no potholes in sight. I guess that's what you get when you've got a HOA breathing down your neck.\n\nMost houses are single-story, but you'll see a few two-story ones sprinkled in.  We don't have those regular mailboxes you'd expect. It's more like an apartment setup, with a big bank of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone's got their own key, and there are even giant lockers for packages. Again, thanks, HOA!\n\nLiving on the edge of the city, it's kinda a mix of suburbia and country. We've got tons of space, which means multiple community pools that everyone can use. They're gated and super clean. Plus, there are walking trails everywhere – perfect for taking your dog for a walk or just getting some fresh air.\n\nMost of the neighbors are retirees. It's a really safe place, and everyone looks out for each other. We also have a few middle-aged and young professionals mixed in.\n\nThe city itself is pretty big, but it has a small-town vibe. We've got all the essentials – like one mall, which isn't huge, but gets the job done. It takes about 15 minutes to get there, but once you're there, you've got all kinds of stores, from fancy organic grocery stores to bargain outlets.\n\nOverall, my neighborhood is pretty typical – safe, well-kept, and predictable. We've got nice amenities like pools and trails, and while we're not right next to any major shopping centers, a quick drive gets you there.",
            "I call this little Midwestern town home. It's just outside the sprawling suburbs of a big city. My neighborhood, on the east side, is the less affluent part of town.  The houses here are mostly rentals or owned by folks who aren't rolling in dough. It's not a bad place, though.  My neighbors are generally friendly, always waving and saying hello. Crime isn't exactly low, it's a bit higher than in other parts of town, but not by much.  There have been a couple of shootings and even a homicide a few blocks away in the past ten years.  It hit home when our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a bar last year. Luckily, our family hasn't been directly affected by crime, except maybe the occasional missing item from our porch if we forget to bring it in.\n\nThe whole town, like a lot of places, has been struggling with the opioid epidemic.  Sadly, there have been some lives lost to fentanyl overdoses. But there are good things happening too. There are addiction recovery centers and Narcan training programs for families and friends, helping folks fight this problem.\n\nDespite the challenges, there are plenty of good things about this town. My son loves his elementary school. The principal, teachers, and support staff are all fantastic. He hasn't faced any bullying, even though he has special needs, because the school has such a positive atmosphere. The PTO is super active, organizing events throughout the year to get families involved and support the kids' learning.  Since over 20% of the town lives below the poverty line, the school provides free breakfast and lunch to all the students so no kid ever goes hungry.  No one is made to feel less than because they can't afford things. School fees, supplies, and field trips are also very reasonable.\n\nThe City Council has been working hard to improve the town, fixing roads, adding landscaping, and sprucing up the parks.  Most of these improvements seem to be happening in the downtown area and on the west side, where most of the shops and traffic are. The east side, where I live, tends to get left behind, which is frustrating for folks like me.\n\nAll in all, I'm happy living here. The people are friendly, the schools are great, there are plenty of places to shop, and our house might not be worth much, but it's comfy and we have everything we need. We've been here for over 16 years, and it feels like home.",
            "My neighborhood's got this crazy vibe, you know?  It's perched on a hill, surrounded by buildings with stories etched into their walls.  I live in a seven-story apartment building right across from this old theater, and just down the street is this awesome arcade bar that draws in all kinds of people on warm summer nights.  Especially in June and July, you'll see lines of folks waiting to get in, especially on weekends.  A few blocks up is a park, surprisingly big for this part of town. It's walled in with concrete and has these massive steps built right into it. During the winter, when it gets freezing, you'll see homeless folks setting up their tents in rows along the sidewalk and those steps. It doesn't snow much here, but the winter rains are brutal, and huddled together in the city center keeps them warmer than out in the open. Plus, they're close to the only family center for miles, where they can shower and wash up.\n\nBut the coolest thing about my city isn't the history, the grand buildings, or the architecture spilling down the hills towards the ocean.  What gets me is the people. Hilltop, where I live, used to be known for gang violence, the toughest place on the West Coast. Even now, thirty years later, you hear stories about cops and the DEA cracking down, trying to clean things up.  The people here remember.  These stories get passed down through generations, even to newcomers like me. \n\nDespite the rough reputation it still has, they work hard to keep the neighborhood clean and care about what's happening on their streets. You hear folks say white people shouldn't walk around Hilltop after dark.  I think that's just old history clinging on, a bitter taste of prejudice. Maybe it's because I'm brown enough to blend in, or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of them, someone who gets it, who sees the reminders of racism and assumptions everywhere, even in a city that's supposed to be a melting pot. \n\nWhatever it is, I know I'm home here. Walking those streets at night, meeting people who are more likely to offer you a jacket than rob you, that's real life. It's the laundromat owner who waits a few extra minutes so you can charge your phone when you're trapped by the rain.  It's the stranger who sees you huddled against a store front on a dark night, looks you in the eye, hands you five bucks, and tells you you're beautiful and valuable. That's Hilltop.",
            "I live in small-town Michigan, the type of place where farmland gives way to charming tourist spots. You won't find any big-city chains like malls, Wal-Mart, Target, or even an Applebee's here.  Getting around means hopping in the car, but it's worth it because I live in one of the most beautiful places imaginable, surrounded by glistening water on all sides. \n\nLake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix frame my \"city,\" making it easy to find a beach for a quick dip. My neighborhood is pure small-town charm. Houses aren't crammed together, they're individual, with some updated and others proudly sporting their vintage character.  Most have full basements visible from the street, and you'll see a rainbow of colors in the aluminum siding, each house boasting a unique personality.\n\nMost yards feature trampolines, playsets, and gardens, with some even housing fences for furry friends. These homes embody the hardworking spirit of Middle America - families raising kids or enjoying the fruits of their labor. It's a place where kids play freely on the streets, you'll see neighbors chatting over fences, and dogs getting their daily exercise.  There's a genuine sense of community, where everyone knows each other, and if you're new in town, you'll quickly learn who's who.\n\nThe lawns are well-maintained, a testament to local pride.  It's not a neighborhood that screams luxury, but rather one that whispers, \"This is a safe and welcoming place to raise a family.\" It's quiet, peaceful, and safe.\n\nEven within walking distance are essential services like the sheriff's department, jail, health department, and recycling center, all contributing to the practical convenience of small-town life.  You can hear the thrill of baseball games from nearby fields, with the nearby airport adding a touch of adventure with the rumble of small planes taking off and landing. A local ice cream shop is just a short stroll away, and a bike ride takes you to a nearby park."
