            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "Portland is a city in the state of Oregon. People often say Portland is a \"weird\" place. You can see this idea on a building that serves as a place to eat pizza, drink, listen to music, and more. The sign on the building says \"Keep Portland Weird.\" Some people want to remember the old Portland. This was a time when the city was less known and not as expensive. It was a place where new and unique ideas were born. Others see it as a message to come to Portland. Here, people are still happy to be called \"weird.\" \n\nEven though many new people have moved to Portland from other states and the city is building more houses, Portland is still a weird place. Being weird does not mean the city does not accept modern things. Like other cities in the United States, we buy most of our things from other countries. Portland has all kinds of normal things too. We have yoga, young people with beards, and business people. Perhaps \"weird\" just means we do not take things too seriously.\n\nIn my neighborhood, the houses are colorful. There are gardens with flowers and vegetables outside. In the summer, people put boxes on the sidewalk. These boxes have things that people are getting rid of. You can find nice clothes and books in these boxes. Sometimes you can find other special things. Walking through my neighborhood is what Portland is all about. But Portland is full of different kinds of people. Some people would never take things from a box on the sidewalk. They go to a place where you do yoga with goats or watch a soccer game. \n\nPortland is a city where people follow their dreams. Some people spend too much time in bars. Yes, Portland has a problem with drugs. Many of these problems start with mental health issues. The rain and gray clouds in Portland may make things worse. The city also has a problem with people without homes. Many people come to Portland for its good social services.

I have cried there many times. I think about my life and my future. I wonder what I will do. I look at the turtles and the ducks. They are living their lives. They are doing their jobs. I want to know my job. I want to know my purpose.\n\nI walk past the pond and the park. I walk past the houses. I walk to the main street. The sun shines bright. The palm trees are green. I look up at the sun. I see the mountains. They are big and strong. They stand up to the sky. They make me feel strong too. They help me keep going.",
            "If you plan to visit Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a hard time finding it. Public transportation is easy to use and is a popular way to travel in New York City. Bensonhurt is a busy neighborhood, so you will still feel like you are in New York City. When you visit, be prepared to see many Asian stores. Over the past twenty years, Bensonhurt has gotten many more Asian people. Because of this, you will see an Asian store almost every block as you walk. Most popular are Asian supermarkets and laundromats. These businesses are favorite among local people because the food is good, prices are low, and it is easy to use them. I see four Asian supermarkets in two minutes walking distance from each other. This makes it easy to get groceries. Bensonhurt is not just Asian people. It is also home to many immigrants and their American children. Many big businesses in the area are owned by Asians. There is also a park nearby with a basketball court, a big field for soccer or baseball, and a water fountain for kids. You will see many kinds of people in this park and everyone gets along well. There are not many big buildings in this neighborhood. Most buildings are for co-op living or apartments. Most people live in two-family houses. The people here are nice, but they can be noisy. You will hear loud music from cars and people speeding by. If you visit at night, you should be careful. This neighborhood is safe, but people can be unpredictable. You may meet people who want to start trouble. I have been in trouble in this neighborhood before, but that was a long time ago. Recently, there was a problem with people stealing packages. It is a problem in many places. Also, people do not clean up after their dogs here. Every morning, you will see dog waste on the street. My big problem is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean.",
            "I live in a place with few sidewalks. Everything goes down, and my house is at the top of the biggest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"workout hill\" because many people like to run up it. Because there are no sidewalks on my street, everyone walks on the road. The road is not smooth in some places and is not safe to drive on. The telephone and electric wires around the block look old and broken. It rains a lot here, so branches and other things often hit the power lines. The power company fixes them often, but they look old. There are many tall trees everywhere. But people do not like the trees. They want to cut them down because they block the view of the ocean. That's why many houses are built high up on the hill with big windows to see the ocean. It is beautiful at sunset when the water shines and the sky turns orange. But most days are cloudy and wet. Moss grows on everything: houses, cars, and railings. I left my car outside for a month and when I came back, it was green with moss. It took me three hours to clean it. There are not many children here, but there is a school a few blocks away. Most people in my neighborhood are old and retired. They have dogs instead of children. It is common to see dogs in people's yards. If you leave a door or window open, they may come in. I once found a dog in my living room and had to send it out. There are also many wild rabbits. They dig up flowers and make holes in people's lawns. My cats like them and have chased most of them away. We see small birds, like sparrows and hummingbirds, and sometimes a hawk or eagle will fly by. But the crows here chase it away. There are no stores near my house, but if you walk downhill to the water, there are restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There is no big beach there, but the rocks are fun to throw into the water. You can see the other side of the bay clearly, even on cloudy days.",
            "I live in a quiet neighborhood in a small town in Tennessee. It is near two highways, so we get some traffic. But most of the time, it is quiet. People know each other in this neighborhood. Many stay here for a long time. They work in their yards and do daily things. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our street.\n\nOur house is at the corner of the street. We see many people and cars every day. If we see a strange car, we take note. Some neighbors walk their dogs or go for exercise. Children ride their bikes. We work from home. There are four of us in my family - my wife and two daughters, 11 and 14 years old. We are used to seeing each other come and go. We play outside, even in the rain. We also grill on our back deck and enjoy the smell of barbecue.\n\nOur neighborhood has many trees. It was once a forest. We have a lot of shade, but also many leaves in the fall. We have to rake and burn the leaves every year. I like the smell of burning leaves. It means fall is here. Lately, we have not had much winter. It feels like a long fall.\n\nOur garage is in the back of our house. We rarely use the front door. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects. When I open the garage door, I feel connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, the neighborhood is quiet. But on Thanksgiving and other holidays, we have visitors from out of town. There are many cars parked on the street. I like living here. If it were not a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is in the desert. It is a dry, brown place. Many people do not understand living here. We see a lot of dirt and few green things. When I first lived here, houses were far apart. Now there are more houses. The area is becoming like a city. But it is still a nice place. People are friendly. I am lucky to live here. The stores in my area are mostly chain stores. They sell food and other things. If we want healthy food, we must go to another place. My city is good for building things. Many people work in construction. It is because there is still a lot of empty space. I am not happy about this. I like things the way they are now. I moved from a big city and I do not want to go back.\n\nI work in construction. My job is to put up walls and install metal bars. I like the animals in my area. People come to the desert for its beauty. The desert has hard conditions for plants and animals. We must protect them. My family and I like the animals. My children like lizards and insects. They are outside now, trying to catch them.\n\nWe have some fun things to do here. Victorville is a good place for families. We can visit the San Bernardino County Fair. It is an annual event. We can also visit Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and go skiing. If you like history and nature, visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has rocks, bones, and other things that tell the story of the desert.",
            "My neighborhood is different from most. I live on a college campus. My community is the people in my dorm. I also think of the campus as my neighborhood, but to a lesser degree. My neighborhood has some things in common with other neighborhoods. It has houses, people, stores, and parks.\n\nLet's talk about the houses in my neighborhood. There are three kinds of houses here. They are apartments, regular houses, and dormitories. In the apartments, 2-4 people share a room. There are 4-6 rooms on each floor. Each building has about 20 people. The regular houses have 2-4 bedrooms. They are mostly for alumni. There are not many of these houses. The dormitories are the most common. Two people share a room. Some rooms have only one person. This is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood.\n\nMy school values diversity. I see people from different cultures and ages. The staff live in the houses. The new students live in the dormitories. The older students live in the apartments. The stores in my neighborhood offer food, clothes, and other things. They are like stores in other neighborhoods. The park is for everyone. It is clean and safe because everyone looks out for each other.",
            "I have lived in this neighborhood for about 10 years. When I first came here, I was sad. My family moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I missed my old home and my friends. But my parents wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a new place with better housing and a good school.\n\nOver time, I made new friends in school and got used to living here. I did not get to know my neighbors very well, except for Mr. Glen and his children, and Dennis. They are nice people. I consider them like family. I remember when Mr. Glen got married again. It was a happy time. I also remember catching a piece of his wife's jewelry when she threw it. I was happy to be at the wedding and dance with Mr. Glen's daughter, Marsharii.\n\nThe neighborhood is like a maze, but now I have a GPS, so I can explore it. I like to go to the park and enjoy nature. It makes me feel calm and peaceful. I also like to practice my balance with sticks from the hardware store and my wooden sword. I have fun doing things I love.\n\nThere are also a basketball and tennis court in the neighborhood. I used to play tennis with my dad and his friend, Mr. Graves. They made us work hard, but we always had fun. I hope to play again soon. I have many good memories in this neighborhood, and I am excited for what is to come.",
            "I live near the college I attend. It's very convenient. There are many apartment buildings, some restaurants, and bars nearby. These places are not too expensive. One bar was recently renamed and is a bit more expensive, but the service and drinks are good. Most people are friendly. Some are college students, and others are lower income because the apartments are affordable. There is an elementary school near my apartment, so there are many children around. I do not know my neighbors very well. They smoke a lot, so I think it's funny that the building management put an air freshener near their door. The buildings near me are old, but maybe they have been renovated inside. Down the street, there are new apartments, but I don't like them. They are poorly built and expensive. The management can charge high rent because they are close to the college. Near my home is a very cheap restaurant that serves food on paper plates. Most of the food is microwaved. Across the street is a gas station that is not a good place to work. The city fixed the road last summer, so it's now nicer. My apartment building is surrounded by trees. They cut a few down, but there are still many trees. Behind my building is a tree line and another set of apartments. I live on 42nd Street, but 43rd Street is not as nice. The sidewalks are bad, and the buildings look old. There are many trees on 43rd Street to hide the condition of the buildings. Crime has happened at an apartment complex on 43rd Street, but I think I like living in my area. I can afford it, and there are many useful things nearby. I like that the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops to get to the store and downtown.",
            "I live in a neighborhood with homes on a circle. They are not very far apart. Each house looks different because of its color. Almost every house is painted yellow with a white porch and a green metal roof. We are friends with most people in the neighborhood. On some evenings, we stand at the end of the street and talk to each other. Our children play outside, draw on the sidewalk with chalk, or fly kites. This is nice in a world with many machines and computers. It is like going back in time.\n\nWe are near fields and trees with big, blue skies and white clouds. But we have a problem. We have had warnings about tornadoes. Recently, we heard the warning sirens and had to go to a safe place. I went to the bathtub with my little dog. My big dog stayed in the living room and barked nervously. We heard hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the street was hot. We had gone from 92 to 75 degrees in a few minutes. The hail melted on the hot pavement. The sun came out, and it started to rain. I saw a double rainbow and took a picture. The street was quiet for a while after the storm. Then people came home, and it was like usual. Mothers and children were outside while their food cooked.\n\nI like my neighborhood. I just moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I like the way people talk here. I have a small apartment with two bedrooms and two bathrooms. All the houses look the same on the outside, but the apartments inside are not the same. Some are very small. I like to walk in the big field behind my home. I go to a small pond that is not for swimming. I see deer, and in the morning, I hear a big frog singing. It is a nice place to live, 40 minutes from the city of Charlotte. Every morning, I hear roosters crowing from the nearby farms. It is like living in a small village. We even have a donkey that brays in the evening to say hello. I was lucky to find this nice neighborhood.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood when I was going into eighth grade. At first, it was hard for me to make friends. But I got close to two boys who lived near me. One lived two houses down, and the other lived on my street. They don't live here anymore, but I still have good memories. The people who lived here when I moved here are still here. My neighborhood is like a typical American neighborhood. There are many houses with two floors. Every weekend, I hear children playing outside when it's warm. The neighborhood is usually quiet. I have never had a problem with the people here. They leave me alone unless I need help. I have ordered many packages online, and they have never been stolen. I feel safe with my neighbors. There is a park close to my house. I have good memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with the other boys in the neighborhood. But I also got hurt playing football and broke my nose. The good memories are more than the bad. Now, I go to the park to play with my cousin's kids. They are very young and like to play on swings and slides. When I go to the park, they are happy. The park makes me feel good. My neighborhood is very different. You can find many kinds of food nearby. There are Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants within a short walk. But many people now use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get food delivered. There are many fast food places, but you can find those in any suburban neighborhood. There are also many pizza places. The stores here have everything we need. There are dry cleaners, a pharmacy, and a grocery store. Some stores are special, like an Indian store where you can buy Indian food. I like my neighborhood. When I see bad news about neighbors on social media, I am happy to live here.",
            "I live in a small town in South Carolina. It's not a big town, but it's important to the farming industry. Johnston is called the Peach Capital of the World. You can see this on a sign when you enter the town. The town is mostly fields of peach trees and cattle. Houses are usually two stories high with metal roofs or gray shingles. They are not usually near the road, so the front fields are used for animals and crops. In the middle of town, there is a traffic light. This is where the town's stores are. There are three places to get fast food: Hong Kong, a Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a small burger place. There used to be a pizzeria, but it closed. There is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They are known for their Cherry Coca-Cola. The only grocery store is IGA. People usually go to Walmart in another town to buy most of their groceries. The most popular store is Dollar General. Many people shop here every day. There is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. They will even deliver the furniture. Next to the furniture store is a pet groomer called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They help take care of pets. There are two small doctor's and veterinary offices outside the main part of town. They take care of the town's residents. There is one elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Kids go to middle and high school in the next town after fifth grade. The town is building a 2.5 acre park. They want to give people a place to have fun and attract new visitors.",
            "I first heard about my apartment on a podcast about people who disappear. It was surprising. My area is very expensive. I have never heard of this story or my friends. We are often in financial trouble. But we have learned to be careful with our money. We like old things. We like the smell of old toys and old clothes. \n\nThere are three second-hand stores near my home. I can walk to them. There is a library and a store with old books. There is also a store with strange things. The streets in my area are very busy. But it is quiet in the second-hand stores. You can be alone and quiet in a second-hand store. It is a good place to spend the afternoon.\n\nMy city is growing. Many people and cars move here every day. It is like New York. People are busy with their own goals. They do not ask many questions. You can be alone if you want. You can keep your secrets. My area is different from the South. In the South, people care about each other. Here, people leave each other alone.\n\nI like my neighbors. We help each other. We celebrate birthdays and holidays together. We help each other when we need it. I am lucky to live here. My neighbors are kind to me. We clean up after ourselves and share food. We bring each other mail. It is nice to see them. I think they like my company.\n\nI live in a big, modern city. But my neighbors make me feel like I am not alone.",
            "I live in a typical suburb. My neighborhood is in a place called suburbia. We have a group that makes sure the homes are well taken care of. They make sure the yards are clean and nice. The houses are all the same size and look nice. They have small trees and grass. Everyone has a two-car garage. The roads are new and smooth. There are no big holes in the roads. Most homes are one story, but some are two stories. We do not have a special box outside each home to get the mail. Instead, we have a big group of boxes at the end of the street. We use a key to get our mail. We also have two big boxes for packages. The place where I live is on the edge of a bigger city. We have a lot of space. We have two swimming pools that anyone can use. They are clean and safe. We also have walking paths where you can walk your dog or go for a walk. We do not need to go to a park to exercise. The neighborhood is big enough to run around in and get some exercise. Most people who live here are old. The area is very safe. Everyone helps each other. We also have some middle-aged and young people living here. The city is big, but it feels small. We have many things we need, like a big store with many things to buy. We can also drive to other stores that are not in our neighborhood. It takes 15 minutes to drive to a big store. There are many kinds of stores to choose from. We have stores that sell healthy food and stores that sell cheap things. My neighborhood is safe, clean, and nice. We have many good things, like pools and walking paths. We can also drive to other places to shop.",
            "I live in a small town in the middle of America. It is near a big city, but not in it. My home is in the part of the town that is not very rich. The houses are not very valuable, and people with low incomes live here. However, it is a nice place to live. My neighbors are friendly and say hello when they see me walking down the street. There are some problems with crime in this area. There have been some violent crimes recently. Unfortunately, some people have been hurt or killed in these crimes. But this has not happened to my family. We have not lost anything important. A big problem in our town is the use of bad medicines that can hurt people. Many people have died from these medicines. We have special programs to help people who are using these medicines. There are also programs to teach people how to save lives if someone is hurt by these medicines. This town has many good things. The school my child attends is very good. The teachers and staff are kind and helpful. My child has special needs, but he is not treated unfairly at school. Everyone at the school is very kind to him. We have a group of parents who help plan events at the school. These events bring the community together and help students learn. Many families in our town do not have a lot of money. So, the school gives food to all students for free. No one is treated unfairly because they do not have money. The town government is making some changes to improve our town. They are fixing roads, planting trees, and making parks nicer. These changes are mostly in the center of town and on the other side of town where the stores are. The part of town where I live is not getting as much attention, which is a problem for my neighbors and me. Despite the problems, I like living in this town. People are friendly, the schools are good, and there are stores to buy what we need. My family and I have lived here for many years and do not want to leave.",
            "My neighborhood is a place with a lot of culture. It is on a hill and has old buildings with history. I live in a 7-story apartment building near an old theater. A little way down the hill is a fun bar where different kinds of people go on warm summer nights. There is usually a long line to get in, especially on weekends in June and July. The nearby park is big and nice, considering the area. The park has concrete walls with stairs. During the cold winter months, homeless people set up tents along the sidewalk and stairs. It does not snow much, but it rains, and the heavy rain in the middle of winter can make it hard to stay warm. The homeless people set up their tents close together in the city center, not in the woods. They are near a place where people can bathe and shower.\n\nWhat I like about my city is not the old buildings or the beautiful architecture. What I like is the people. You see, my neighborhood used to be a very violent place. The government and police came in to clean it up many years ago. The people still talk about those days. They work hard to keep their city clean and nice. They still care about what happens in their city and neighborhood. Some people say that if you are white, you should not walk around here at night. But I think this is old advice. Maybe because I am not fully white, the people here accept me. I feel safe and happy here. I meet people who are kind and friendly. They help me when I need it. This place is my home, and I will always love it.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan, USA. It is a rural area with many farms and small cities. There is no big shopping center like a mall. If we need something, we must drive to get it. But I live in a beautiful place. My town is near two big lakes: Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. We can find a beach to swim in almost everywhere we go. My neighborhood is a small town. The houses are not close together. They are not the same as each other. They are old houses. Some are new, some are old. Many houses have basements. You can see them from the street. Most houses have yards with trampolines, playsets, gardens, and fences for animals. The houses look like they are in the middle of America. Good people live there. They work hard to make a living. They raise families or have raised families. On any day, you can see kids running in the streets. You can see people walking dogs, biking, or rollerblading. Neighbors know each other. They can tell who belongs in the neighborhood and who does not. We wave and smile at each other. The lawns are clean. The grass is cut short. People take care of their plants and bushes. It is not a beautiful neighborhood that looks amazing when you drive in. But it is a good place to live. It is quiet, peaceful, and safe. We have a sheriff's department and a health department nearby. We also have a recycling center and baseball fields. You can hear planes flying overhead. We can walk to get ice cream and go to the park. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, which is just a few blocks away. It is a great place to live."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most houses are single-family homes. Some houses have been divided into two parts, but they are still connected. My house has a small front yard and a small driveway to the side. It looks like many other houses around here. They remind us of a time when living in the suburbs was the American dream. Many people thought this was a great way to live. But now, it seems like the dream is not as perfect as it used to be. My neighborhood still looks nice. It still says that the dream is real. People still take care of their yards, even if it's not as well as before. There are still cars in every driveway. Kids still play outside. The public school has been here for almost 90 years. It looks like it will still be here for a long time. It gives hope to the young people and makes older people happy. There are not many churches in our neighborhood. But the basketball courts are always busy. All the houses are different, but they all feel the same. We have a big supermarket called Super A. It is owned by a big family. They are the only Arab family in our neighborhood. Most of the people here are African American. The streets are wide, and kids play football on them. Most people have lived here for many years. They know each other. There used to be a karate school. But when people stopped liking karate movies, the school became a pharmacy. There is a small movie theater that shows old movies at a low price. The older people like it. They think it's a good way to spend the evening. We have a highway that goes through our town. But it goes into the next town at the entrance and exit. Some people wanted to put an exit in our town, but most people did not want it. They thought it would ruin our town. There is a new high school being built, and we are choosing a name for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be a good symbol for our town.",
            "You might not see it at first. It is a residential area behind a shopping strip. People do not think it is a place where people live. But if you look closely, you will find a busy community. It is behind an old store called Whole Foods. This store is not used much. The only time it is used is for families to visit. \n\nThere are apartments in this community. They are next to each other like Russian nesting dolls. The first apartments have problems. They were on the news. But the other apartments are different. They are a world that not many people know about. Across the street from these apartments is a small college. Students go there to learn. They drink coffee and look tired in the morning. The gates open slowly to let them in. People driving cars get mad because they are stopped.\n\nThe road goes into another street. There is a park on one side and a place where people go to get better after they are hurt. The place has nice chairs on the porch and a fan that moves the air. Children play in the park. They are laughing and running. There are dogs walking with old people. They are talking to teenagers on skateboards and looking at the girls talking near the park equipment.\n\nThere is a restaurant near the park that serves sushi. It is not very busy. There is a store that sells things for pools and a place where people get their nails done. You can fill your pool and get a manicure and eat at the same time. There is also a place that sells frozen yogurt. Teenagers eat it while they are skateboarding and vaping. This neighborhood is like a movie about America. It is a part of history in a quiet place where not much changes.",
            "She looked out the car window at the corn fields. \"Where are we?\" she asked. I smiled, knowing she was surprised by the open space. She was from a town where the store was close to her home. She had never seen so much empty space before.\n\nI told her about growing up in rural Ohio. She started to understand who I was and where I came from. We drove down a two-lane road. There was a big hole in the ground with water. Past that was my neighborhood. The houses were made of brick and stucco. Each house had a big yard. People liked to take care of their yards. In the spring, there were pretty flowers and trees that change color with the seasons. The driveways had expensive cars. They looked shiny after a wash.\n\nI passed her my home, a grey house with a big yard. My Korean neighbor was outside. He was friendly and always mowed his lawn. He sang while he worked. Everyone liked him. He was a doctor a long time ago. Now he is older and less funny. In my yard, there are geese and a dog. In the back, there is a stream. You can hear birds, the stream, and animals on a farm.\n\nThere is a small bridge made of wood. On the other side, there are many trees and plants that grow on their own. I spent much time there when I was a child. I built forts and chased animals. There were always friends to play with. In the winter, it gets very cold. But it is beautiful. The trees are empty and there is snow. We made angels in the snow and snowmen. My sister and I fought, but we made fun in the winter. We built forts and used sticks as weapons. We were happy and free.",
            "Portland is a city in the state of Oregon. People often say Portland is a \"weird\" place. You can see this idea on a building that serves as a place to eat pizza, drink, listen to music, and more. The sign on the building says \"Keep Portland Weird.\" Some people want to remember the old Portland. This was a time when the city was less known and not as expensive. It was a place where new and unique ideas were born. Others see it as a message to come to Portland. Here, people are still happy to be called \"weird.\" \n\nEven though many new people have moved to Portland from other states and the city is building more houses, Portland is still a weird place. Being weird does not mean the city does not accept modern things. Like other cities in the United States, we buy most of our things from other countries. Portland has all kinds of normal things too. We have yoga, young people with beards, and business people. Perhaps \"weird\" just means we do not take things too seriously.\n\nIn my neighborhood, the houses are colorful. There are gardens with flowers and vegetables outside. In the summer, people put boxes on the sidewalk. These boxes have things that people are getting rid of. You can find nice clothes and books in these boxes. Sometimes you can find other special things. Walking through my neighborhood is what Portland is all about. But Portland is full of different kinds of people. Some people would never take things from a box on the sidewalk. They go to a place where you do yoga with goats or watch a soccer game. \n\nPortland is a city where people follow their dreams. Some people spend too much time in bars. Yes, Portland has a problem with drugs. Many of these problems start with mental health issues. The rain and gray clouds in Portland may make things worse. The city also has a problem with people without homes. Many people come to Portland for its good social services. However, these services are not enough.\n\nThe people who have homes do not know what to do about the homeless problem. Some people feel sorry for them, while others do not want them around. In this, Portland is not so different from other cities. We are not always weird.",
            "The mountains are always there. They are in the north. They see the sun every day. They see the sun rise and set. I sometimes forget about them. I get busy with work and life. But they are always there. They do not change. They do not fight. They do not feel stressed. They just are.\n\nWhen I am very tired, I look at them. They help me feel better. They give me strength to keep going. I first saw them when I came to this place for school. I was studying here. I liked the mountains. The university is nice. It has pretty buildings and a pond. But the mountains are special. They are strong and steady.\n\nThe town is also nice. There are many coffee shops. I study there often. There are also many restaurants and stores in the downtown area. They are old and interesting. The town is not too big, but it is not too small either. It is a good size.\n\nSometimes I like to walk in the town. Sometimes I like to take the bus. Sometimes I like to go to the library. The library is quiet. It is a good place to think. The town has two kinds of feelings. It is busy and quiet. It is like a mix of big city and small town. I like this mix. I like to explore it.\n\nI have good memories here. I have bad memories too. Memories are a part of life. The pond is a good place to think. It is a good place to cry. I have cried there many times. I think about my life and my future. I wonder what I will do. I look at the turtles and the ducks. They are living their lives. They are doing their jobs. I want to know my job. I want to know my purpose.\n\nI walk past the pond and the park. I walk past the houses. I walk to the main street. The sun shines bright. The palm trees are green. I look up at the sun. I see the mountains. They are big and strong. They stand up to the sky. They make me feel strong too. They help me keep going.",
            "If you plan to visit Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a hard time finding it. Public transportation is easy to use and is a popular way to travel in New York City. Bensonhurt is a busy neighborhood, so you will still feel like you are in New York City. When you visit, be prepared to see many Asian stores. Over the past twenty years, Bensonhurt has gotten many more Asian people. Because of this, you will see an Asian store almost every block as you walk. Most popular are Asian supermarkets and laundromats. These businesses are favorite among local people because the food is good, prices are low, and it is easy to use them. I see four Asian supermarkets in two minutes walking distance from each other. This makes it easy to get groceries. Bensonhurt is not just Asian people. It is also home to many immigrants and their American children. Many big businesses in the area are owned by Asians. There is also a park nearby with a basketball court, a big field for soccer or baseball, and a water fountain for kids. You will see many kinds of people in this park and everyone gets along well. There are not many big buildings in this neighborhood. Most buildings are for co-op living or apartments. Most people live in two-family houses. The people here are nice, but they can be noisy. You will hear loud music from cars and people speeding by. If you visit at night, you should be careful. This neighborhood is safe, but people can be unpredictable. You may meet people who want to start trouble. I have been in trouble in this neighborhood before, but that was a long time ago. Recently, there was a problem with people stealing packages. It is a problem in many places. Also, people do not clean up after their dogs here. Every morning, you will see dog waste on the street. My big problem is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean.",
            "I live in a place with few sidewalks. Everything goes down, and my house is at the top of the biggest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"workout hill\" because many people like to run up it. Because there are no sidewalks on my street, everyone walks on the road. The road is not smooth in some places and is not safe to drive on. The telephone and electric wires around the block look old and broken. It rains a lot here, so branches and other things often hit the power lines. The power company fixes them often, but they look old. There are many tall trees everywhere. But people do not like the trees. They want to cut them down because they block the view of the ocean. That's why many houses are built high up on the hill with big windows to see the ocean. It is beautiful at sunset when the water shines and the sky turns orange. But most days are cloudy and wet. Moss grows on everything: houses, cars, and railings. I left my car outside for a month and when I came back, it was green with moss. It took me three hours to clean it. There are not many children here, but there is a school a few blocks away. Most people in my neighborhood are old and retired. They have dogs instead of children. It is common to see dogs in people's yards. If you leave a door or window open, they may come in. I once found a dog in my living room and had to send it out. There are also many wild rabbits. They dig up flowers and make holes in people's lawns. My cats like them and have chased most of them away. We see small birds, like sparrows and hummingbirds, and sometimes a hawk or eagle will fly by. But the crows here chase it away. There are no stores near my house, but if you walk downhill to the water, there are restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There is no big beach there, but the rocks are fun to throw into the water. You can see the other side of the bay clearly, even on cloudy days.",
            "I live in a quiet neighborhood in a small town in Tennessee. It is near two highways, so we get some traffic. But most of the time, it is quiet. People know each other in this neighborhood. Many stay here for a long time. They work in their yards and do daily things. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our street.\n\nOur house is at the corner of the street. We see many people and cars every day. If we see a strange car, we take note. Some neighbors walk their dogs or go for exercise. Children ride their bikes. We work from home. There are four of us in my family - my wife and two daughters, 11 and 14 years old. We are used to seeing each other come and go. We play outside, even in the rain. We also grill on our back deck and enjoy the smell of barbecue.\n\nOur neighborhood has many trees. It was once a forest. We have a lot of shade, but also many leaves in the fall. We have to rake and burn the leaves every year. I like the smell of burning leaves. It means fall is here. Lately, we have not had much winter. It feels like a long fall.\n\nOur garage is in the back of our house. We rarely use the front door. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects. When I open the garage door, I feel connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, the neighborhood is quiet. But on Thanksgiving and other holidays, we have visitors from out of town. There are many cars parked on the street. I like living here. If it were not a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is in the desert. It is a dry, brown place. Many people do not understand living here. We see a lot of dirt and few green things. When I first lived here, houses were far apart. Now there are more houses. The area is becoming like a city. But it is still a nice place. People are friendly. I am lucky to live here. The stores in my area are mostly chain stores. They sell food and other things. If we want healthy food, we must go to another place. My city is good for building things. Many people work in construction. It is because there is still a lot of empty space. I am not happy about this. I like things the way they are now. I moved from a big city and I do not want to go back.\n\nI work in construction. My job is to put up walls and install metal bars. I like the animals in my area. People come to the desert for its beauty. The desert has hard conditions for plants and animals. We must protect them. My family and I like the animals. My children like lizards and insects. They are outside now, trying to catch them.\n\nWe have some fun things to do here. Victorville is a good place for families. We can visit the San Bernardino County Fair. It is an annual event. We can also visit Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and go skiing. If you like history and nature, visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has rocks, bones, and other things that tell the story of the desert.",
            "My neighborhood is different from most. I live on a college campus. My community is the people in my dorm. I also think of the campus as my neighborhood, but to a lesser degree. My neighborhood has some things in common with other neighborhoods. It has houses, people, stores, and parks.\n\nLet's talk about the houses in my neighborhood. There are three kinds of houses here. They are apartments, regular houses, and dormitories. In the apartments, 2-4 people share a room. There are 4-6 rooms on each floor. Each building has about 20 people. The regular houses have 2-4 bedrooms. They are mostly for alumni. There are not many of these houses. The dormitories are the most common. Two people share a room. Some rooms have only one person. This is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood.\n\nMy school values diversity. I see people from different cultures and ages. The staff live in the houses. The new students live in the dormitories. The older students live in the apartments. The stores in my neighborhood offer food, clothes, and other things. They are like stores in other neighborhoods. The park is for everyone. It is clean and safe because everyone looks out for each other.",
            "I have lived in this neighborhood for about 10 years. When I first came here, I was sad. My family moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I missed my old home and my friends. But my parents wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a new place with better housing and a good school.\n\nOver time, I made new friends in school and got used to living here. I did not get to know my neighbors very well, except for Mr. Glen and his children, and Dennis. They are nice people. I consider them like family. I remember when Mr. Glen got married again. It was a happy time. I also remember catching a piece of his wife's jewelry when she threw it. I was happy to be at the wedding and dance with Mr. Glen's daughter, Marsharii.\n\nThe neighborhood is like a maze, but now I have a GPS, so I can explore it. I like to go to the park and enjoy nature. It makes me feel calm and peaceful. I also like to practice my balance with sticks from the hardware store and my wooden sword. I have fun doing things I love.\n\nThere are also a basketball and tennis court in the neighborhood. I used to play tennis with my dad and his friend, Mr. Graves. They made us work hard, but we always had fun. I hope to play again soon. I have many good memories in this neighborhood, and I am excited for what is to come.",
            "I live near the college I attend. It's very convenient. There are many apartment buildings, some restaurants, and bars nearby. These places are not too expensive. One bar was recently renamed and is a bit more expensive, but the service and drinks are good. Most people are friendly. Some are college students, and others are lower income because the apartments are affordable. There is an elementary school near my apartment, so there are many children around. I do not know my neighbors very well. They smoke a lot, so I think it's funny that the building management put an air freshener near their door. The buildings near me are old, but maybe they have been renovated inside. Down the street, there are new apartments, but I don't like them. They are poorly built and expensive. The management can charge high rent because they are close to the college. Near my home is a very cheap restaurant that serves food on paper plates. Most of the food is microwaved. Across the street is a gas station that is not a good place to work. The city fixed the road last summer, so it's now nicer. My apartment building is surrounded by trees. They cut a few down, but there are still many trees. Behind my building is a tree line and another set of apartments. I live on 42nd Street, but 43rd Street is not as nice. The sidewalks are bad, and the buildings look old. There are many trees on 43rd Street to hide the condition of the buildings. Crime has happened at an apartment complex on 43rd Street, but I think I like living in my area. I can afford it, and there are many useful things nearby. I like that the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops to get to the store and downtown.",
            "I live in a neighborhood with homes on a circle. They are not very far apart. Each house looks different because of its color. Almost every house is painted yellow with a white porch and a green metal roof. We are friends with most people in the neighborhood. On some evenings, we stand at the end of the street and talk to each other. Our children play outside, draw on the sidewalk with chalk, or fly kites. This is nice in a world with many machines and computers. It is like going back in time.\n\nWe are near fields and trees with big, blue skies and white clouds. But we have a problem. We have had warnings about tornadoes. Recently, we heard the warning sirens and had to go to a safe place. I went to the bathtub with my little dog. My big dog stayed in the living room and barked nervously. We heard hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the street was hot. We had gone from 92 to 75 degrees in a few minutes. The hail melted on the hot pavement. The sun came out, and it started to rain. I saw a double rainbow and took a picture. The street was quiet for a while after the storm. Then people came home, and it was like usual. Mothers and children were outside while their food cooked.\n\nI like my neighborhood. I just moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I like the way people talk here. I have a small apartment with two bedrooms and two bathrooms. All the houses look the same on the outside, but the apartments inside are not the same. Some are very small. I like to walk in the big field behind my home. I go to a small pond that is not for swimming. I see deer, and in the morning, I hear a big frog singing. It is a nice place to live, 40 minutes from the city of Charlotte. Every morning, I hear roosters crowing from the nearby farms. It is like living in a small village. We even have a donkey that brays in the evening to say hello. I was lucky to find this nice neighborhood.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood when I was going into eighth grade. At first, it was hard for me to make friends. But I got close to two boys who lived near me. One lived two houses down, and the other lived on my street. They don't live here anymore, but I still have good memories. The people who lived here when I moved here are still here. My neighborhood is like a typical American neighborhood. There are many houses with two floors. Every weekend, I hear children playing outside when it's warm. The neighborhood is usually quiet. I have never had a problem with the people here. They leave me alone unless I need help. I have ordered many packages online, and they have never been stolen. I feel safe with my neighbors. There is a park close to my house. I have good memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with the other boys in the neighborhood. But I also got hurt playing football and broke my nose. The good memories are more than the bad. Now, I go to the park to play with my cousin's kids. They are very young and like to play on swings and slides. When I go to the park, they are happy. The park makes me feel good. My neighborhood is very different. You can find many kinds of food nearby. There are Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants within a short walk. But many people now use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get food delivered. There are many fast food places, but you can find those in any suburban neighborhood. There are also many pizza places. The stores here have everything we need. There are dry cleaners, a pharmacy, and a grocery store. Some stores are special, like an Indian store where you can buy Indian food. I like my neighborhood. When I see bad news about neighbors on social media, I am happy to live here.",
            "I live in a small town in South Carolina. It's not a big town, but it's important to the farming industry. Johnston is called the Peach Capital of the World. You can see this on a sign when you enter the town. The town is mostly fields of peach trees and cattle. Houses are usually two stories high with metal roofs or gray shingles. They are not usually near the road, so the front fields are used for animals and crops. In the middle of town, there is a traffic light. This is where the town's stores are. There are three places to get fast food: Hong Kong, a Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a small burger place. There used to be a pizzeria, but it closed. There is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They are known for their Cherry Coca-Cola. The only grocery store is IGA. People usually go to Walmart in another town to buy most of their groceries. The most popular store is Dollar General. Many people shop here every day. There is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. They will even deliver the furniture. Next to the furniture store is a pet groomer called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They help take care of pets. There are two small doctor's and veterinary offices outside the main part of town. They take care of the town's residents. There is one elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Kids go to middle and high school in the next town after fifth grade. The town is building a 2.5 acre park. They want to give people a place to have fun and attract new visitors.",
            "I first heard about my apartment on a podcast about people who disappear. It was surprising. My area is very expensive. I have never heard of this story or my friends. We are often in financial trouble. But we have learned to be careful with our money. We like old things. We like the smell of old toys and old clothes. \n\nThere are three second-hand stores near my home. I can walk to them. There is a library and a store with old books. There is also a store with strange things. The streets in my area are very busy. But it is quiet in the second-hand stores. You can be alone and quiet in a second-hand store. It is a good place to spend the afternoon.\n\nMy city is growing. Many people and cars move here every day. It is like New York. People are busy with their own goals. They do not ask many questions. You can be alone if you want. You can keep your secrets. My area is different from the South. In the South, people care about each other. Here, people leave each other alone.\n\nI like my neighbors. We help each other. We celebrate birthdays and holidays together. We help each other when we need it. I am lucky to live here. My neighbors are kind to me. We clean up after ourselves and share food. We bring each other mail. It is nice to see them. I think they like my company.\n\nI live in a big, modern city. But my neighbors make me feel like I am not alone.",
            "I live in a typical suburb. My neighborhood is in a place called suburbia. We have a group that makes sure the homes are well taken care of. They make sure the yards are clean and nice. The houses are all the same size and look nice. They have small trees and grass. Everyone has a two-car garage. The roads are new and smooth. There are no big holes in the roads. Most homes are one story, but some are two stories. We do not have a special box outside each home to get the mail. Instead, we have a big group of boxes at the end of the street. We use a key to get our mail. We also have two big boxes for packages. The place where I live is on the edge of a bigger city. We have a lot of space. We have two swimming pools that anyone can use. They are clean and safe. We also have walking paths where you can walk your dog or go for a walk. We do not need to go to a park to exercise. The neighborhood is big enough to run around in and get some exercise. Most people who live here are old. The area is very safe. Everyone helps each other. We also have some middle-aged and young people living here. The city is big, but it feels small. We have many things we need, like a big store with many things to buy. We can also drive to other stores that are not in our neighborhood. It takes 15 minutes to drive to a big store. There are many kinds of stores to choose from. We have stores that sell healthy food and stores that sell cheap things. My neighborhood is safe, clean, and nice. We have many good things, like pools and walking paths. We can also drive to other places to shop.",
            "I live in a small town in the middle of America. It is near a big city, but not in it. My home is in the part of the town that is not very rich. The houses are not very valuable, and people with low incomes live here. However, it is a nice place to live. My neighbors are friendly and say hello when they see me walking down the street. There are some problems with crime in this area. There have been some violent crimes recently. Unfortunately, some people have been hurt or killed in these crimes. But this has not happened to my family. We have not lost anything important. A big problem in our town is the use of bad medicines that can hurt people. Many people have died from these medicines. We have special programs to help people who are using these medicines. There are also programs to teach people how to save lives if someone is hurt by these medicines. This town has many good things. The school my child attends is very good. The teachers and staff are kind and helpful. My child has special needs, but he is not treated unfairly at school. Everyone at the school is very kind to him. We have a group of parents who help plan events at the school. These events bring the community together and help students learn. Many families in our town do not have a lot of money. So, the school gives food to all students for free. No one is treated unfairly because they do not have money. The town government is making some changes to improve our town. They are fixing roads, planting trees, and making parks nicer. These changes are mostly in the center of town and on the other side of town where the stores are. The part of town where I live is not getting as much attention, which is a problem for my neighbors and me. Despite the problems, I like living in this town. People are friendly, the schools are good, and there are stores to buy what we need. My family and I have lived here for many years and do not want to leave.",
            "My neighborhood is a place with a lot of culture. It is on a hill and has old buildings with history. I live in a 7-story apartment building near an old theater. A little way down the hill is a fun bar where different kinds of people go on warm summer nights. There is usually a long line to get in, especially on weekends in June and July. The nearby park is big and nice, considering the area. The park has concrete walls with stairs. During the cold winter months, homeless people set up tents along the sidewalk and stairs. It does not snow much, but it rains, and the heavy rain in the middle of winter can make it hard to stay warm. The homeless people set up their tents close together in the city center, not in the woods. They are near a place where people can bathe and shower.\n\nWhat I like about my city is not the old buildings or the beautiful architecture. What I like is the people. You see, my neighborhood used to be a very violent place. The government and police came in to clean it up many years ago. The people still talk about those days. They work hard to keep their city clean and nice. They still care about what happens in their city and neighborhood. Some people say that if you are white, you should not walk around here at night. But I think this is old advice. Maybe because I am not fully white, the people here accept me. I feel safe and happy here. I meet people who are kind and friendly. They help me when I need it. This place is my home, and I will always love it.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan, USA. It is a rural area with many farms and small cities. There is no big shopping center like a mall. If we need something, we must drive to get it. But I live in a beautiful place. My town is near two big lakes: Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. We can find a beach to swim in almost everywhere we go. My neighborhood is a small town. The houses are not close together. They are not the same as each other. They are old houses. Some are new, some are old. Many houses have basements. You can see them from the street. Most houses have yards with trampolines, playsets, gardens, and fences for animals. The houses look like they are in the middle of America. Good people live there. They work hard to make a living. They raise families or have raised families. On any day, you can see kids running in the streets. You can see people walking dogs, biking, or rollerblading. Neighbors know each other. They can tell who belongs in the neighborhood and who does not. We wave and smile at each other. The lawns are clean. The grass is cut short. People take care of their plants and bushes. It is not a beautiful neighborhood that looks amazing when you drive in. But it is a good place to live. It is quiet, peaceful, and safe. We have a sheriff's department and a health department nearby. We also have a recycling center and baseball fields. You can hear planes flying overhead. We can walk to get ice cream and go to the park. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, which is just a few blocks away. It is a great place to live."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I live in a big city. My neighborhood is very different. It has many kinds of places. Some are homes, while others are offices, stores, restaurants, and places to have fun. There are many new places to eat and buy things. Some stores are large and well-known, but small shops are also popular. These small shops are in shopping centers and on the streets. They are close to quiet neighborhoods. My neighborhood also has parks. People take their children to these parks. My neighborhood is very diverse. We have many kinds of people. In one area, there is a community for LGBTQ+ people, an Orthodox Jewish community, and people from the former Soviet Union. In other areas, there are many people from different countries. We have areas called Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia. These areas are not too far from my neighborhood. However, it takes a long time to drive there because of traffic. Many people do not walk in my city. Even though some places are close, the city is very big. We have bad traffic and it is hard to find parking. The city is being built up with new apartment buildings. Many people live in these buildings. Some residents do not like this because it means more people and more cars. In my neighborhood, there are different kinds of homes. Not everyone lives in a big apartment building. Some people live in houses, apartments, or condominiums. Some homes have many rooms, while others have fewer rooms. This is true in my neighborhood. We also have people of different ages. I do not know most of my neighbors. My neighborhood is not very close. However, when I was a child, I played with my next-door neighbor and a few friends.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most houses are single-family homes. Some houses have been divided into two parts, but they are still connected. My house has a small front yard and a small driveway to the side. It looks like many other houses around here. They remind us of a time when living in the suburbs was the American dream. Many people thought this was a great way to live. But now, it seems like the dream is not as perfect as it used to be. My neighborhood still looks nice. It still says that the dream is real. People still take care of their yards, even if it's not as well as before. There are still cars in every driveway. Kids still play outside. The public school has been here for almost 90 years. It looks like it will still be here for a long time. It gives hope to the young people and makes older people happy. There are not many churches in our neighborhood. But the basketball courts are always busy. All the houses are different, but they all feel the same. We have a big supermarket called Super A. It is owned by a big family. They are the only Arab family in our neighborhood. Most of the people here are African American. The streets are wide, and kids play football on them. Most people have lived here for many years. They know each other. There used to be a karate school. But when people stopped liking karate movies, the school became a pharmacy. There is a small movie theater that shows old movies at a low price. The older people like it. They think it's a good way to spend the evening. We have a highway that goes through our town. But it goes into the next town at the entrance and exit. Some people wanted to put an exit in our town, but most people did not want it. They thought it would ruin our town. There is a new high school being built, and we are choosing a name for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be a good symbol for our town.",
            "You might not see it at first. It is a residential area behind a shopping strip. People do not think it is a place where people live. But if you look closely, you will find a busy community. It is behind an old store called Whole Foods. This store is not used much. The only time it is used is for families to visit. \n\nThere are apartments in this community. They are next to each other like Russian nesting dolls. The first apartments have problems. They were on the news. But the other apartments are different. They are a world that not many people know about. Across the street from these apartments is a small college. Students go there to learn. They drink coffee and look tired in the morning. The gates open slowly to let them in. People driving cars get mad because they are stopped.\n\nThe road goes into another street. There is a park on one side and a place where people go to get better after they are hurt. The place has nice chairs on the porch and a fan that moves the air. Children play in the park. They are laughing and running. There are dogs walking with old people. They are talking to teenagers on skateboards and looking at the girls talking near the park equipment.\n\nThere is a restaurant near the park that serves sushi. It is not very busy. There is a store that sells things for pools and a place where people get their nails done. You can fill your pool and get a manicure and eat at the same time. There is also a place that sells frozen yogurt. Teenagers eat it while they are skateboarding and vaping. This neighborhood is like a movie about America. It is a part of history in a quiet place where not much changes.",
            "She looked out the car window at the corn fields. \"Where are we?\" she asked. I smiled, knowing she was surprised by the open space. She was from a town where the store was close to her home. She had never seen so much empty space before.\n\nI told her about growing up in rural Ohio. She started to understand who I was and where I came from. We drove down a two-lane road. There was a big hole in the ground with water. Past that was my neighborhood. The houses were made of brick and stucco. Each house had a big yard. People liked to take care of their yards. In the spring, there were pretty flowers and trees that change color with the seasons. The driveways had expensive cars. They looked shiny after a wash.\n\nI passed her my home, a grey house with a big yard. My Korean neighbor was outside. He was friendly and always mowed his lawn. He sang while he worked. Everyone liked him. He was a doctor a long time ago. Now he is older and less funny. In my yard, there are geese and a dog. In the back, there is a stream. You can hear birds, the stream, and animals on a farm.\n\nThere is a small bridge made of wood. On the other side, there are many trees and plants that grow on their own. I spent much time there when I was a child. I built forts and chased animals. There were always friends to play with. In the winter, it gets very cold. But it is beautiful. The trees are empty and there is snow. We made angels in the snow and snowmen. My sister and I fought, but we made fun in the winter. We built forts and used sticks as weapons. We were happy and free.",
            "Portland is a city in the state of Oregon. People often say Portland is a \"weird\" place. You can see this idea on a building that serves as a place to eat pizza, drink, listen to music, and more. The sign on the building says \"Keep Portland Weird.\" Some people want to remember the old Portland. This was a time when the city was less known and not as expensive. It was a place where new and unique ideas were born. Others see it as a message to come to Portland. Here, people are still happy to be called \"weird.\" \n\nEven though many new people have moved to Portland from other states and the city is building more houses, Portland is still a weird place. Being weird does not mean the city does not accept modern things. Like other cities in the United States, we buy most of our things from other countries. Portland has all kinds of normal things too. We have yoga, young people with beards, and business people. Perhaps \"weird\" just means we do not take things too seriously.\n\nIn my neighborhood, the houses are colorful. There are gardens with flowers and vegetables outside. In the summer, people put boxes on the sidewalk. These boxes have things that people are getting rid of. You can find nice clothes and books in these boxes. Sometimes you can find other special things. Walking through my neighborhood is what Portland is all about. But Portland is full of different kinds of people. Some people would never take things from a box on the sidewalk. They go to a place where you do yoga with goats or watch a soccer game. \n\nPortland is a city where people follow their dreams. Some people spend too much time in bars. Yes, Portland has a problem with drugs. Many of these problems start with mental health issues. The rain and gray clouds in Portland may make things worse. The city also has a problem with people without homes. Many people come to Portland for its good social services. However, these services are not enough.\n\nThe people who have homes do not know what to do about the homeless problem. Some people feel sorry for them, while others do not want them around. In this, Portland is not so different from other cities. We are not always weird.",
            "The mountains are always there. They are in the north. They see the sun every day. They see the sun rise and set. I sometimes forget about them. I get busy with work and life. But they are always there. They do not change. They do not fight. They do not feel stressed. They just are.\n\nWhen I am very tired, I look at them. They help me feel better. They give me strength to keep going. I first saw them when I came to this place for school. I was studying here. I liked the mountains. The university is nice. It has pretty buildings and a pond. But the mountains are special. They are strong and steady.\n\nThe town is also nice. There are many coffee shops. I study there often. There are also many restaurants and stores in the downtown area. They are old and interesting. The town is not too big, but it is not too small either. It is a good size.\n\nSometimes I like to walk in the town. Sometimes I like to take the bus. Sometimes I like to go to the library. The library is quiet. It is a good place to think. The town has two kinds of feelings. It is busy and quiet. It is like a mix of big city and small town. I like this mix. I like to explore it.\n\nI have good memories here. I have bad memories too. Memories are a part of life. The pond is a good place to think. It is a good place to cry. I have cried there many times. I think about my life and my future. I wonder what I will do. I look at the turtles and the ducks. They are living their lives. They are doing their jobs. I want to know my job. I want to know my purpose.\n\nI walk past the pond and the park. I walk past the houses. I walk to the main street. The sun shines bright. The palm trees are green. I look up at the sun. I see the mountains. They are big and strong. They stand up to the sky. They make me feel strong too. They help me keep going.",
            "If you plan to visit Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a hard time finding it. Public transportation is easy to use and is a popular way to travel in New York City. Bensonhurt is a busy neighborhood, so you will still feel like you are in New York City. When you visit, be prepared to see many Asian stores. Over the past twenty years, Bensonhurt has gotten many more Asian people. Because of this, you will see an Asian store almost every block as you walk. Most popular are Asian supermarkets and laundromats. These businesses are favorite among local people because the food is good, prices are low, and it is easy to use them. I see four Asian supermarkets in two minutes walking distance from each other. This makes it easy to get groceries. Bensonhurt is not just Asian people. It is also home to many immigrants and their American children. Many big businesses in the area are owned by Asians. There is also a park nearby with a basketball court, a big field for soccer or baseball, and a water fountain for kids. You will see many kinds of people in this park and everyone gets along well. There are not many big buildings in this neighborhood. Most buildings are for co-op living or apartments. Most people live in two-family houses. The people here are nice, but they can be noisy. You will hear loud music from cars and people speeding by. If you visit at night, you should be careful. This neighborhood is safe, but people can be unpredictable. You may meet people who want to start trouble. I have been in trouble in this neighborhood before, but that was a long time ago. Recently, there was a problem with people stealing packages. It is a problem in many places. Also, people do not clean up after their dogs here. Every morning, you will see dog waste on the street. My big problem is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean.",
            "I live in a place with few sidewalks. Everything goes down, and my house is at the top of the biggest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"workout hill\" because many people like to run up it. Because there are no sidewalks on my street, everyone walks on the road. The road is not smooth in some places and is not safe to drive on. The telephone and electric wires around the block look old and broken. It rains a lot here, so branches and other things often hit the power lines. The power company fixes them often, but they look old. There are many tall trees everywhere. But people do not like the trees. They want to cut them down because they block the view of the ocean. That's why many houses are built high up on the hill with big windows to see the ocean. It is beautiful at sunset when the water shines and the sky turns orange. But most days are cloudy and wet. Moss grows on everything: houses, cars, and railings. I left my car outside for a month and when I came back, it was green with moss. It took me three hours to clean it. There are not many children here, but there is a school a few blocks away. Most people in my neighborhood are old and retired. They have dogs instead of children. It is common to see dogs in people's yards. If you leave a door or window open, they may come in. I once found a dog in my living room and had to send it out. There are also many wild rabbits. They dig up flowers and make holes in people's lawns. My cats like them and have chased most of them away. We see small birds, like sparrows and hummingbirds, and sometimes a hawk or eagle will fly by. But the crows here chase it away. There are no stores near my house, but if you walk downhill to the water, there are restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There is no big beach there, but the rocks are fun to throw into the water. You can see the other side of the bay clearly, even on cloudy days.",
            "I live in a quiet neighborhood in a small town in Tennessee. It is near two highways, so we get some traffic. But most of the time, it is quiet. People know each other in this neighborhood. Many stay here for a long time. They work in their yards and do daily things. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our street.\n\nOur house is at the corner of the street. We see many people and cars every day. If we see a strange car, we take note. Some neighbors walk their dogs or go for exercise. Children ride their bikes. We work from home. There are four of us in my family - my wife and two daughters, 11 and 14 years old. We are used to seeing each other come and go. We play outside, even in the rain. We also grill on our back deck and enjoy the smell of barbecue.\n\nOur neighborhood has many trees. It was once a forest. We have a lot of shade, but also many leaves in the fall. We have to rake and burn the leaves every year. I like the smell of burning leaves. It means fall is here. Lately, we have not had much winter. It feels like a long fall.\n\nOur garage is in the back of our house. We rarely use the front door. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects. When I open the garage door, I feel connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, the neighborhood is quiet. But on Thanksgiving and other holidays, we have visitors from out of town. There are many cars parked on the street. I like living here. If it were not a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is in the desert. It is a dry, brown place. Many people do not understand living here. We see a lot of dirt and few green things. When I first lived here, houses were far apart. Now there are more houses. The area is becoming like a city. But it is still a nice place. People are friendly. I am lucky to live here. The stores in my area are mostly chain stores. They sell food and other things. If we want healthy food, we must go to another place. My city is good for building things. Many people work in construction. It is because there is still a lot of empty space. I am not happy about this. I like things the way they are now. I moved from a big city and I do not want to go back.\n\nI work in construction. My job is to put up walls and install metal bars. I like the animals in my area. People come to the desert for its beauty. The desert has hard conditions for plants and animals. We must protect them. My family and I like the animals. My children like lizards and insects. They are outside now, trying to catch them.\n\nWe have some fun things to do here. Victorville is a good place for families. We can visit the San Bernardino County Fair. It is an annual event. We can also visit Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and go skiing. If you like history and nature, visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has rocks, bones, and other things that tell the story of the desert.",
            "My neighborhood is different from most. I live on a college campus. My community is the people in my dorm. I also think of the campus as my neighborhood, but to a lesser degree. My neighborhood has some things in common with other neighborhoods. It has houses, people, stores, and parks.\n\nLet's talk about the houses in my neighborhood. There are three kinds of houses here. They are apartments, regular houses, and dormitories. In the apartments, 2-4 people share a room. There are 4-6 rooms on each floor. Each building has about 20 people. The regular houses have 2-4 bedrooms. They are mostly for alumni. There are not many of these houses. The dormitories are the most common. Two people share a room. Some rooms have only one person. This is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood.\n\nMy school values diversity. I see people from different cultures and ages. The staff live in the houses. The new students live in the dormitories. The older students live in the apartments. The stores in my neighborhood offer food, clothes, and other things. They are like stores in other neighborhoods. The park is for everyone. It is clean and safe because everyone looks out for each other.",
            "I have lived in this neighborhood for about 10 years. When I first came here, I was sad. My family moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I missed my old home and my friends. But my parents wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a new place with better housing and a good school.\n\nOver time, I made new friends in school and got used to living here. I did not get to know my neighbors very well, except for Mr. Glen and his children, and Dennis. They are nice people. I consider them like family. I remember when Mr. Glen got married again. It was a happy time. I also remember catching a piece of his wife's jewelry when she threw it. I was happy to be at the wedding and dance with Mr. Glen's daughter, Marsharii.\n\nThe neighborhood is like a maze, but now I have a GPS, so I can explore it. I like to go to the park and enjoy nature. It makes me feel calm and peaceful. I also like to practice my balance with sticks from the hardware store and my wooden sword. I have fun doing things I love.\n\nThere are also a basketball and tennis court in the neighborhood. I used to play tennis with my dad and his friend, Mr. Graves. They made us work hard, but we always had fun. I hope to play again soon. I have many good memories in this neighborhood, and I am excited for what is to come.",
            "I live near the college I attend. It's very convenient. There are many apartment buildings, some restaurants, and bars nearby. These places are not too expensive. One bar was recently renamed and is a bit more expensive, but the service and drinks are good. Most people are friendly. Some are college students, and others are lower income because the apartments are affordable. There is an elementary school near my apartment, so there are many children around. I do not know my neighbors very well. They smoke a lot, so I think it's funny that the building management put an air freshener near their door. The buildings near me are old, but maybe they have been renovated inside. Down the street, there are new apartments, but I don't like them. They are poorly built and expensive. The management can charge high rent because they are close to the college. Near my home is a very cheap restaurant that serves food on paper plates. Most of the food is microwaved. Across the street is a gas station that is not a good place to work. The city fixed the road last summer, so it's now nicer. My apartment building is surrounded by trees. They cut a few down, but there are still many trees. Behind my building is a tree line and another set of apartments. I live on 42nd Street, but 43rd Street is not as nice. The sidewalks are bad, and the buildings look old. There are many trees on 43rd Street to hide the condition of the buildings. Crime has happened at an apartment complex on 43rd Street, but I think I like living in my area. I can afford it, and there are many useful things nearby. I like that the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops to get to the store and downtown.",
            "I live in a neighborhood with homes on a circle. They are not very far apart. Each house looks different because of its color. Almost every house is painted yellow with a white porch and a green metal roof. We are friends with most people in the neighborhood. On some evenings, we stand at the end of the street and talk to each other. Our children play outside, draw on the sidewalk with chalk, or fly kites. This is nice in a world with many machines and computers. It is like going back in time.\n\nWe are near fields and trees with big, blue skies and white clouds. But we have a problem. We have had warnings about tornadoes. Recently, we heard the warning sirens and had to go to a safe place. I went to the bathtub with my little dog. My big dog stayed in the living room and barked nervously. We heard hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the street was hot. We had gone from 92 to 75 degrees in a few minutes. The hail melted on the hot pavement. The sun came out, and it started to rain. I saw a double rainbow and took a picture. The street was quiet for a while after the storm. Then people came home, and it was like usual. Mothers and children were outside while their food cooked.\n\nI like my neighborhood. I just moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I like the way people talk here. I have a small apartment with two bedrooms and two bathrooms. All the houses look the same on the outside, but the apartments inside are not the same. Some are very small. I like to walk in the big field behind my home. I go to a small pond that is not for swimming. I see deer, and in the morning, I hear a big frog singing. It is a nice place to live, 40 minutes from the city of Charlotte. Every morning, I hear roosters crowing from the nearby farms. It is like living in a small village. We even have a donkey that brays in the evening to say hello. I was lucky to find this nice neighborhood.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood when I was going into eighth grade. At first, it was hard for me to make friends. But I got close to two boys who lived near me. One lived two houses down, and the other lived on my street. They don't live here anymore, but I still have good memories. The people who lived here when I moved here are still here. My neighborhood is like a typical American neighborhood. There are many houses with two floors. Every weekend, I hear children playing outside when it's warm. The neighborhood is usually quiet. I have never had a problem with the people here. They leave me alone unless I need help. I have ordered many packages online, and they have never been stolen. I feel safe with my neighbors. There is a park close to my house. I have good memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with the other boys in the neighborhood. But I also got hurt playing football and broke my nose. The good memories are more than the bad. Now, I go to the park to play with my cousin's kids. They are very young and like to play on swings and slides. When I go to the park, they are happy. The park makes me feel good. My neighborhood is very different. You can find many kinds of food nearby. There are Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants within a short walk. But many people now use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get food delivered. There are many fast food places, but you can find those in any suburban neighborhood. There are also many pizza places. The stores here have everything we need. There are dry cleaners, a pharmacy, and a grocery store. Some stores are special, like an Indian store where you can buy Indian food. I like my neighborhood. When I see bad news about neighbors on social media, I am happy to live here.",
            "I live in a small town in South Carolina. It's not a big town, but it's important to the farming industry. Johnston is called the Peach Capital of the World. You can see this on a sign when you enter the town. The town is mostly fields of peach trees and cattle. Houses are usually two stories high with metal roofs or gray shingles. They are not usually near the road, so the front fields are used for animals and crops. In the middle of town, there is a traffic light. This is where the town's stores are. There are three places to get fast food: Hong Kong, a Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a small burger place. There used to be a pizzeria, but it closed. There is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They are known for their Cherry Coca-Cola. The only grocery store is IGA. People usually go to Walmart in another town to buy most of their groceries. The most popular store is Dollar General. Many people shop here every day. There is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. They will even deliver the furniture. Next to the furniture store is a pet groomer called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They help take care of pets. There are two small doctor's and veterinary offices outside the main part of town. They take care of the town's residents. There is one elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Kids go to middle and high school in the next town after fifth grade. The town is building a 2.5 acre park. They want to give people a place to have fun and attract new visitors.",
            "I first heard about my apartment on a podcast about people who disappear. It was surprising. My area is very expensive. I have never heard of this story or my friends. We are often in financial trouble. But we have learned to be careful with our money. We like old things. We like the smell of old toys and old clothes. \n\nThere are three second-hand stores near my home. I can walk to them. There is a library and a store with old books. There is also a store with strange things. The streets in my area are very busy. But it is quiet in the second-hand stores. You can be alone and quiet in a second-hand store. It is a good place to spend the afternoon.\n\nMy city is growing. Many people and cars move here every day. It is like New York. People are busy with their own goals. They do not ask many questions. You can be alone if you want. You can keep your secrets. My area is different from the South. In the South, people care about each other. Here, people leave each other alone.\n\nI like my neighbors. We help each other. We celebrate birthdays and holidays together. We help each other when we need it. I am lucky to live here. My neighbors are kind to me. We clean up after ourselves and share food. We bring each other mail. It is nice to see them. I think they like my company.\n\nI live in a big, modern city. But my neighbors make me feel like I am not alone.",
            "I live in a typical suburb. My neighborhood is in a place called suburbia. We have a group that makes sure the homes are well taken care of. They make sure the yards are clean and nice. The houses are all the same size and look nice. They have small trees and grass. Everyone has a two-car garage. The roads are new and smooth. There are no big holes in the roads. Most homes are one story, but some are two stories. We do not have a special box outside each home to get the mail. Instead, we have a big group of boxes at the end of the street. We use a key to get our mail. We also have two big boxes for packages. The place where I live is on the edge of a bigger city. We have a lot of space. We have two swimming pools that anyone can use. They are clean and safe. We also have walking paths where you can walk your dog or go for a walk. We do not need to go to a park to exercise. The neighborhood is big enough to run around in and get some exercise. Most people who live here are old. The area is very safe. Everyone helps each other. We also have some middle-aged and young people living here. The city is big, but it feels small. We have many things we need, like a big store with many things to buy. We can also drive to other stores that are not in our neighborhood. It takes 15 minutes to drive to a big store. There are many kinds of stores to choose from. We have stores that sell healthy food and stores that sell cheap things. My neighborhood is safe, clean, and nice. We have many good things, like pools and walking paths. We can also drive to other places to shop.",
            "I live in a small town in the middle of America. It is near a big city, but not in it. My home is in the part of the town that is not very rich. The houses are not very valuable, and people with low incomes live here. However, it is a nice place to live. My neighbors are friendly and say hello when they see me walking down the street. There are some problems with crime in this area. There have been some violent crimes recently. Unfortunately, some people have been hurt or killed in these crimes. But this has not happened to my family. We have not lost anything important. A big problem in our town is the use of bad medicines that can hurt people. Many people have died from these medicines. We have special programs to help people who are using these medicines. There are also programs to teach people how to save lives if someone is hurt by these medicines. This town has many good things. The school my child attends is very good. The teachers and staff are kind and helpful. My child has special needs, but he is not treated unfairly at school. Everyone at the school is very kind to him. We have a group of parents who help plan events at the school. These events bring the community together and help students learn. Many families in our town do not have a lot of money. So, the school gives food to all students for free. No one is treated unfairly because they do not have money. The town government is making some changes to improve our town. They are fixing roads, planting trees, and making parks nicer. These changes are mostly in the center of town and on the other side of town where the stores are. The part of town where I live is not getting as much attention, which is a problem for my neighbors and me. Despite the problems, I like living in this town. People are friendly, the schools are good, and there are stores to buy what we need. My family and I have lived here for many years and do not want to leave.",
            "My neighborhood is a place with a lot of culture. It is on a hill and has old buildings with history. I live in a 7-story apartment building near an old theater. A little way down the hill is a fun bar where different kinds of people go on warm summer nights. There is usually a long line to get in, especially on weekends in June and July. The nearby park is big and nice, considering the area. The park has concrete walls with stairs. During the cold winter months, homeless people set up tents along the sidewalk and stairs. It does not snow much, but it rains, and the heavy rain in the middle of winter can make it hard to stay warm. The homeless people set up their tents close together in the city center, not in the woods. They are near a place where people can bathe and shower.\n\nWhat I like about my city is not the old buildings or the beautiful architecture. What I like is the people. You see, my neighborhood used to be a very violent place. The government and police came in to clean it up many years ago. The people still talk about those days. They work hard to keep their city clean and nice. They still care about what happens in their city and neighborhood. Some people say that if you are white, you should not walk around here at night. But I think this is old advice. Maybe because I am not fully white, the people here accept me. I feel safe and happy here. I meet people who are kind and friendly. They help me when I need it. This place is my home, and I will always love it.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan, USA. It is a rural area with many farms and small cities. There is no big shopping center like a mall. If we need something, we must drive to get it. But I live in a beautiful place. My town is near two big lakes: Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. We can find a beach to swim in almost everywhere we go. My neighborhood is a small town. The houses are not close together. They are not the same as each other. They are old houses. Some are new, some are old. Many houses have basements. You can see them from the street. Most houses have yards with trampolines, playsets, gardens, and fences for animals. The houses look like they are in the middle of America. Good people live there. They work hard to make a living. They raise families or have raised families. On any day, you can see kids running in the streets. You can see people walking dogs, biking, or rollerblading. Neighbors know each other. They can tell who belongs in the neighborhood and who does not. We wave and smile at each other. The lawns are clean. The grass is cut short. People take care of their plants and bushes. It is not a beautiful neighborhood that looks amazing when you drive in. But it is a good place to live. It is quiet, peaceful, and safe. We have a sheriff's department and a health department nearby. We also have a recycling center and baseball fields. You can hear planes flying overhead. We can walk to get ice cream and go to the park. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, which is just a few blocks away. It is a great place to live."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I live in a big city. My neighborhood is very different. People from many countries live here. Residential areas and businesses are not together in one place. Some areas are homes and some are stores, restaurants, and places to have fun. There are many new restaurants and stores to visit. Some stores are well-known, big companies. Other stores are small and popular. These stores are in malls and on the streets. The streets are close to quiet neighborhoods.\n\nThere are parks near my home. People take their children to these parks. My neighborhood is also home to many different kinds of people. There is a community for people who are LGBTQ+, an Orthodox Jewish community, and people from the Soviet Union. Outside my neighborhood, there are more people from different countries. However, they are often in their own groups. We have Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and more. These areas are not very far from my neighborhood.\n\nBut it takes a long time to drive between these areas. We have a lot of traffic. People do not usually walk in my city. Even if places are close, it is hard to walk because the city is big. We have a lot of problems with traffic and parking. There are also many new buildings being built. Some people like this, but others are unhappy. They are worried about more people coming to the city.\n\nThere are many kinds of homes in my city. Not everyone lives in a big apartment building. We have single-family homes, smaller apartment buildings, and condominiums. Even in my neighborhood, there are different kinds of homes. People of all ages live here. I do not know most of my neighbors. It is not like it used to be when I was a kid. I used to play with my neighbors and friends.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most houses are for one family. But some homes are divided into two, still connected. My house has a small yard in front and a small driveway to the side. It looks like the past when people wanted to live in the suburbs. This was the American dream. People thought it was perfect. But now it's changing. My neighborhood still looks the same. It still seems like the American dream is real. The people here are holding on to it. They still have cars in their driveways. Kids still play outside. The public school has been here for almost 90 years. It still looks to the future. It makes the young people happy. It makes old people remember the past. There are not many churches. But the basketball courts are full. The houses look different. But they feel the same. There is a big store called Super A. It is owned by a family of Yemenis. They are one of the few Arab families here. Most people are African American. The streets are wide. The kids play football. They stop when cars come. Most people have lived here for a long time. They know each other. There was a karate school. But when the kids stopped wanting to be karate fighters, it became a pharmacy. There is a small movie theater. It shows old movies at a low price. The kids don't like it. But the old people like it. There is a highway that goes through our town. But the entrance and exit are in the next town. We once wanted a special exit. The young people wanted it. But the old people said no. They thought the highway would ruin our town. We are building a new school. We are choosing a symbol for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a cabin would be the best symbol.",
            "You might not notice it at first. This is a residential area behind a shopping strip. It does not look like a place where people live. But if you go behind the old, empty store, you will see a busy community. Behind the hotels, you can find many apartments lined up in a row. These apartments are near a community college. The college has a small campus with quiet buildings. Students go there to learn and sleep in. They come in through iron gates one by one. People who drive to work are stuck in traffic because of the students. The road meets another road with a park on one side. There is a center to help people who are hurt. The center has nice furniture on the porch and a fan that moves the air. Children play in the park across the street. They run and play while bees fly around the flowers. Old people walk their dogs and watch the teenagers on skateboards. There is a place to eat sushi near the park. It is not very busy. There is also a store to buy things for swimming pools and a place to get a nail job. You can buy food and get a manicure at the same time. There is a place that sells frozen yogurt, too. Teenagers eat frozen yogurt while they do tricks on their skateboards. This neighborhood is like a piece of American history. It is a quiet place where not much changes.",
            "She asked, \"Where are we?\" as we drove past many fields of corn that went on forever. I said, \"This is it!\" knowing she would be surprised by the open space. She came from a town where the grocery store was near her house. She had never seen so much open space before. I told her what it was like to grow up in a small town in Ohio. In that moment, she understood who I was and where I came from.\n\nWe drove down a small country road. There was a big hole in the ground with water in it. Just past it was where I live. The houses are made of brick and stucco. Each house has a big piece of land around it that people take care of. In the spring, there are many flowers and trees that change color with the seasons. The driveways are full of nice cars. The people who live here are very happy and take care of their homes.\n\nAs we walked down the road, I saw my Korean neighbor. He was outside and friendly. He uses a big machine to cut the grass and likes to sing while he works. Everyone in the neighborhood likes him. He has a special story. He used to be a doctor, but now he is older and a little slower. He is still a kind person.\n\nWe finally arrived at my house. There are many geese in the yard. Our dog chases them. There is a small stream that goes into the big hole in the ground. I can hear frogs, the stream, and sometimes a cow from a nearby farm. Across a small bridge made of wood, there is a special place with many trees, herbs, and flowers that grow naturally. This is where I spent most of my childhood. I built forts and played with my friends. We had a lot of fun.\n\nIn the winter, it can be very cold. But it's also very beautiful. The trees are bare and the yard is empty. If it snows, a beautiful winter wonderland appears. My sister and I would make snow angels and build snowmen. We would also make forts out of branches. We would play pretend and use our imaginations. We were happy kids who didn't have to worry about anything.",
            "Portland, Oregon is a city that likes to be different. The city's unofficial slogan is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" To some people, this is a reminder of the city's past. It was a time when Portland was not as well-known and not as expensive. Many creative and unique cultures developed here. To others, \"Keep Portland Weird\" is a message saying, \"Come to Portland, where you can be different and be accepted for it.\"\n\nEven with many new people moving to Portland and new buildings going up, the city is still strange. Strange does not mean we do not have modern things. We buy many things from other countries. But strange means we can accept things that others do not. Portland has many normal things too, like yoga and business people.\n\nIn my neighborhood, the streets have colorful houses, gardens with flowers and vegetables, and free boxes. Free boxes are boxes with things people are giving away. You might find clothes, books, or something else. It is like treasure hunting. This is a big part of what Portland is about, but it is just my way of being weird. People around me might not want to get things from free boxes. They might go to a special yoga class with goats or a soccer game.\n\nPortland has many people who love many things. Some people like to drink and some people like to pursue their dreams. But Portland also has problems. Some people use too many drugs and struggle with their mental health. The rain and gray skies all year might make them feel worse. Portland also has a homelessness problem. We have good services for the homeless, but they are not enough. The people who do not live on the streets have mixed feelings about this problem. They are not weird about this.",
            "The mountains are always there. They are in the north. They see the sun every morning and every evening. They do not care about my work or my life. They are always there, strong and steady. \n\nWhen I am very stressed, I look at the mountains. They calm my worried heart. They help me feel strong enough to go on. I first saw these mountains when I started college. They are near the campus. The university has many beautiful things. But the mountains are the most beautiful thing to me.\n\nThe rest of the town is also nice. There are many cafés where I study. I can walk or take a bus to the downtown area. It is old and very interesting. But the mountains are the best part. This town has two different feelings. It is like a big city, but also quiet and peaceful. I can walk to the library and be in a quiet place. I can also walk to the busy downtown area. This makes this town very exciting.\n\nI have many happy memories of this town. I walk with my friends in the park after a long night studying. I also walk to the downtown area to see a movie. But this town also has sad memories. I sit by the pond and think about life. I see the turtles and ducks living their lives. I wonder what my purpose is. So I walk to the main street. The sun shines and I look up. I see the mountains. They are strong and beautiful. They remind me to keep going.",
            "If you plan to visit Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have trouble finding it. Public transportation is easy to use. Many people in New York City use it. Bensonhurt is a busy neighborhood, so you will still feel like you are in New York City. You will see many Asian stores when you visit. Many Asian people live in Bensonhurt. This is why you will see an Asian store on almost every block. These stores are very popular. They are good places to buy food, wash clothes, and other things. Many local people like these stores because the food is good, the prices are low, and it is convenient. There are many of these stores near where I live. You can walk to four stores within a few minutes. This makes it easy to buy grocery.\n\nBensonhurt is not only Asian people. It is also home to many immigrants and their families. Many big businesses in the area are owned by Asian people. There is also a park near where I live. It is a good place to play sports or relax. The park has many things, including basketball courts, a big field, and a playground for kids.\n\nThe neighborhood is not very tall. You will not see many big buildings. Most of the houses are two-family homes. The people who live here are usually nice. However, it can be noisy. You may hear loud music from cars or people speeding by. If you visit at night, be careful. Some people can be mean and cause trouble. I was bullied in this neighborhood a long time ago, but I am safe now. There are also people who steal packages. Some people do not clean up after their dogs. You will see dog waste on the ground as you walk to the train or store. My biggest problem is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go.",
            "I live in a place without many sidewalks. Everything flows downhill, and my house is at the top of a very steep hill. People call it the \"work out hill\" because runners like to run up it. There are no sidewalks on my street, so people walk on the road. The road has holes in it, and it can be hard to drive on.\n\nDuring storms, branches and other things often fall on the power lines. The lines need repair, so they look badly fixed. There are many tall evergreen trees around. But people here do not like the trees. They want to cut down as many as they can because the trees block the view of the ocean. Many houses are built high up on the hill to see the ocean. They have big windows to see the water. It is beautiful at sunset when the water shines and the sky turns orange.\n\nBut it is often cloudy and damp. Moss grows on everything. I once left my car in my driveway for a month. When I came back, it was covered in moss. It took me three hours to clean it off. Most people who live here are older, like retired people. There are not many children around. Instead, many people have dogs. They run around in the street, and if you leave a door or window open, they might get in. I once found a dog in my living room and had to chase it out.\n\nThere are also many wild rabbits. They dig up plants and make holes in people's lawns. My cats like to hunt them. We also see birds like small sparrows and hummingbirds. Sometimes a hawk or eagle comes by, but the crows chase it away.\n\nThere are no stores near my house, but if you walk down the hill to the waterfront, there are some restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There is no wide beach, but it is fun to throw rocks into the water. The bay is not very wide, so you can see the other side even on cloudy days.",
            "I live in a quiet neighborhood in a small town in Tennessee. It is near two state highways, so we have some traffic. But mostly, it is quiet. Not many new people move here. I know most of my neighbors. They work in their yards and do their daily jobs. In the winter, my friends and I like to sled down a hill on our street. Our house is at the corner of the street, so we see people all day. We notice when a new car comes to the neighborhood. Some neighbors walk their dogs or exercise. Children ride their bikes. We work from home. There are four of us: my wife and our two daughters, 11 and 14 years old. We see our neighbors often. We like to play outside and sometimes even when it rains. We have a barbecue on our back deck. It smells good. We hear lawn mowers almost every day from March to October. Our neighborhood has many trees. It was a forest before. So, it is cool in the summer and there are many leaves in the fall. We have to rake and burn the leaves every year. I like the smell of burning leaves. Lately, it has not been cold enough to be winter. It just seems like fall is long. I like to work in my garage. It is at the back of our house. I like to fix my truck there. When I open the garage doors, I feel connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, it is quiet. Some neighbors visit their families from out of town. I like living here. If it were not a main street, it would be perfect.",
            "My home is in the middle of the desert. There is a lot of dirt. It is hard to understand what it is like to live here unless you have lived here. The ground is usually brown. If someone has a green lawn, they must spend a lot of money to take care of it. When I first moved here, it was very quiet. Now, many new houses have been built. The area is becoming more and more like a city.\n\nMost people are friendly here. But, like any city, there are good and bad parts. I live near many older people. They are friendly. The stores in our area are mostly big chains like Food for Less and Smart and Final. If you want to buy healthy food, you have to go somewhere else. \n\nThe main jobs in our city are in construction. Many people work in this field. The city is still growing and there is a lot of empty space. I am a construction worker. I install drywall and T-bars. I like living here because of the animals. People come to the desert for its beauty. The desert has a hard environment that needs protection. It is home to many kinds of wildlife. It is good to learn about the animals that live here so we can live together safely.\n\nMy family and I have learned to accept the wildlife. My children like catching lizards and desert bugs. They are outside right now trying to catch them. We have some fun things to do here. If you come to Victorville, you can visit the San Bernardino County Fair. It is a fun event. If you like winter sports, you can go to Wrightwood and see the snow-covered mountains. If you are interested in the natural history and culture of the desert, you can visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has many interesting things to see.",
            "When I think of my neighborhood, I think of my college campus. I live in a dormitory and consider the people who live there my community. I also think of the campus around me as my neighborhood, but to a lesser degree. My neighborhood is different from others because I am a student and live in a dorm. But it has some things in common with other neighborhoods.\n\nMy neighborhood has houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's talk about the houses. There are three kinds of houses near me. There are apartments, houses, and dorms. In the apartments, 2-4 people live in a room. There are 4-6 rooms on each floor. Each building has about 20 people. Some houses have 2-4 bedrooms and are for people who work at the school. There are not many of these. The most common kind of house is the dorm. It has two people in a room, and there are many of these.\n\nMy school values diversity, and this is true of my neighborhood. People from many cultures and ages live here. Some staff live in houses, and students live in dorms or apartments. The people in my neighborhood are a mix of young and old, from many countries. They are a lively and interesting group. Now, let's talk about the stores and parks. My school has many stores, including places to eat and buy food. There are also stores that sell school clothes and other things. Anything you need can be found in my neighborhood. The park is a fun place for everyone to play. It is clean and safe because of the people who live here.",
            "I have lived in this neighborhood for about 10 years. When I first came, I was sad. I missed my old home in Riverdale. But my parents wanted the best for me and my sister. We moved to a new neighborhood in Stockbridge. It was a better place to live. I got used to it and made new friends. I also made some enemies at school. I did not know my neighbors very well. But I knew Mr. Glen and his children. They were nice people. I consider them like family. I went to Mr. Glen's wedding. It was fun. I hope to have a wedding like that someday.\n\nThe neighborhood is like a maze. But now I have a GPS. I can explore it. I have a friend named Kason. We play video games together. We also go to the park. I like to play with sticks and practice my balance. I also like to bring my wooden sword and practice sword fighting. There is a basketball court and a tennis court. I used to play tennis with my dad and my friend. We had fun. I hope to play again someday.\n\nI have had many good times in this neighborhood. I have many stories. But these are the things that I remember. I think the best times are yet to come.",
            "My home is close to the college where I study. I like living here. There are many apartment buildings, a few restaurants, and some bars. These places are fun to visit and not too expensive. One of the bars changed its name. It is more expensive now, but the service and drinks are not bad. Most of the people here are nice. They are students or have lower incomes. The apartment prices are low. There is an elementary school near my home. Many children live here.\n\nI do not know my neighbors. They smoke a lot. The building management put a device to remove smells near their door. My boyfriend and I found it funny. It is almost like they are saying something bad about my neighbors. The buildings around me are old-looking, but maybe they have new inside. A little down the street, there are new apartments. I do not like them because the workers built them cheaply. The rent is high, but the building management can charge too much because it is close to the university.\n\nI live near a restaurant that is very cheap. They serve food on paper plates. Most of their food comes from a microwave. Across from the restaurant is a gas station. I have heard it is not a good place to work. But the city fixed the road near my home last summer. Now there is a nice sidewalk, green grass, and the area looks better.\n\nBehind my apartment building are many trees. The management cut some of them down, so there are some tree stumps. But there are more trees here than down the street. Behind my building is another line of trees and more apartments. I live on 42nd Street. The street behind mine, 43rd Street, is not as nice. The sidewalk is broken, and the buildings look old. There are many trees on this street, but maybe they hide how old the buildings look. Some apartments near me have a lot of problems and a lot of people come and go. I think I like my home. I can afford it, and there are many good things near me. I like that the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops where I can go to the store or downtown easily.",
            "My neighborhood is a group of houses that look like individual homes. They are not too close to each other. The houses are painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost all of the people in the neighborhood are friends. We meet at the end of the street some evenings and talk. The children play with their toys, draw on the sidewalk or fly kites. It is nice to be here. The world is very busy with computers and machines. It feels like a simple time. We are surrounded by fields and trees with blue skies and white clouds. But sometimes we have bad weather. Recently, we had a warning about a tornado. We heard the warning sirens and went to a safe place. I was in my bathtub with my little dog. My big dog was in the living room, barking. The neighborhood was quiet except for loud hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road was hot and steaming. It went from hot to cool in a short time. The hail melted when it hit the hot pavement. Then the sun came out and it started to rain. I saw a beautiful double rainbow. I took a picture with my camera. The neighborhood was quiet for a while after the storm. Then people came home and it was business as usual. Mothers and children were outside, cooking dinner. I like my neighborhood. I moved here from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I like the way people talk here. I have a two-bedroom apartment. So does everyone else. But the apartments are not the same inside. Some are small. I like to walk in the big field behind my house. I go to the pond that is not for swimming. I see deer and hear a big frog singing in the morning. It is a great place to live, just 40 minutes from the city of Charlotte. Each morning I hear roosters crowing from the farms around here. It is like living in a small village. We even have a donkey at a farm nearby that brays in the evening. I am lucky to live here.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood in eighth grade. It was hard to make friends at first, but I got close to two guys who lived nearby. They are not living here anymore, but I still remember the good times. Most of the people who lived here when I moved in are still here. My neighborhood is like many American suburbs. The houses are two stories high and have yards. Children play outside on nice days. The neighborhood is usually quiet. I have never had a problem with the people here. You can be alone unless you need help. I have ordered many packages online, and they have always been safe on my porch. I trust my neighbors. There is a park near my house where I played basketball, football, and baseball with my friends. I also got hurt playing football, but that is not a bad memory. When I visit the park now, I see my cousin's kids playing on the swings and slides. They are happy when they think about going to the park. The park makes me happy too. My neighborhood is different. You can find many kinds of food nearby. There are Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants within a short walk. Many people order food from apps like GrubHub and DoorDash. We also have fast food places and pizza shops. The stores have everything we need. There are dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store. We even have an Indian store where you can buy food to make at home. I like my neighborhood. When I see bad news about neighbors on social media, I am grateful for mine.",
            "My home is in a small town in South Carolina. It is not very different from other towns in the area. But it is very important for growing food. Johnston is known as the World's Peach Capital. The town is proud of this title and shows it on signs. The town is mostly fields with many peach trees or cows. Houses are far apart and are two stories high. Some have metal roofs to keep them cool in the hot summer. Others have gray roofs. The houses are not usually near the road. They are farther back so people can use the front fields for animals or crops. In the middle of town, there is one traffic light. This is where the town's stores are. There are three places to get fast food: Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant; Fiesta Mexican Restaurant; and Gary's, a small burger place. There used to be a pizza place, but it closed. There is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They are famous for selling Cherry Coca-Cola. There is a small grocery store called IGA. People often go to a bigger store in another town to buy most of their groceries. The most popular store is Dollar General. People buy many things there every day. There is a small furniture store run by a kind woman. She has been in business for a long time. There is also a pet groomer next door. They take care of dogs and give them a bath. There are small doctor's and veterinarian offices in the town. The schools in the town are small. Students go to a bigger school in the next town after fifth grade. The town is making a park to give people a place to go and have fun. It will be a nice place to visit and live.",
            "The first time I heard about my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who were missing. It was a surprise. Many apartments in the area cost over one thousand dollars a month. I had never heard of this story before, and neither had my friends. \n\nLife is expensive, but we have learned to be careful with money. We like to visit flea markets and buy old things. They smell good. Adult life can be boring, but flea markets are not. They are always interesting.\n\nThere are three second-hand shops near my home. If I start at one end, I can visit two shops that help poor people, a library, a store with old books, and a store with strange things. The streets are crowded, but it is quiet inside the shops. People and cars go by, but I do not hear them.\n\nI like to visit these shops. They are good places to spend an afternoon. Every year, more people come to live here. It is a growing city. A big company that sells things online has its headquarters here. But the city still has problems. It reminds me of New York. People here are busy with their own lives. They do not ask many questions. I can be alone and quiet, and people will leave me alone.\n\nIt is not like the South, where people care about each other. Here, people are independent. They do not ask personal questions. I can keep to myself if I want. The city is a lively place to live. There are musicians and singers who play music near my home. It is nice to live in a place where I have friends. We help each other. We celebrate birthdays and funerals together. We try to take care of each other.\n\nI am lucky to live here. My neighbors are nice. I try to be clean and share food with them. They do the same for me. We take care of each other's mail. It is nice to see them and be around them.\n\nI live in a big, modern city. But my neighbors make me feel happy. They are good people.",
            "I live in a common kind of neighborhood called suburbia. My neighborhood is part of a bigger community with rules, called a homeowner's association. The rules keep the neighborhood clean and nice. When you enter the neighborhood, you see many homes that are similar. They are all single-family homes with grass, small trees, and short driveways. The roads are in good condition and are not broken. Most homes are one story, but some are two stories. There are no separate boxes for mail in front of each house. Instead, there is a big group of boxes at the end of the street. You need a key to open your box. The neighborhood is on the edge of a city, so it has a lot of space. We have big pools and walking paths where you can take your dog or walk alone. The neighborhood is safe and people help each other. Many people who live here are older, but we also have some middle-aged and young people. The city near my neighborhood is big, but it feels small. We have many things you need, like a mall. I can drive to the mall in about 15 minutes and find many stores. I can buy healthy food at one store or cheap things at another store. My neighborhood is safe and nice. We have many good things, like pools and walking paths. It takes a little time to get to big stores, but I can drive there easily.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest. My town is near a big city, but it is not in the city area. My neighborhood is on the east side of the town. It is one of the poorer areas. Homes here are not very expensive, and many people rent or own them. But my neighborhood is not bad or ugly. Most people in my neighborhood are friendly. They say hello when I walk by. There are some problems with crime here. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years. But they are not very common. We have had some problems with things going missing from our porch. Our family has not been directly hurt by crime.\n\nOur town has a big problem with the opioid epidemic. Many people in the United States have this problem. Our town is one of them. Many people have died from overdoses. We have some good resources to help people with this problem. There are places where people can go for help. We also have training to help people who know someone with addiction.\n\nBut our town also has good things. My son's elementary school is very good. The teachers and staff are kind. My son is in school there, and he likes it. He has special needs, but he has not been bullied. The school is a happy place. The school provides food for all students. No one has to go hungry. The school also does not charge a lot for things like school supplies and field trips.\n\nOur town's government is trying to make the town better. They have fixed some roads and parks. But most of this work has been done in the center of town and on the west side, where people shop and drive. My neighborhood on the east side is not as lucky. This is a problem for us.\n\nI like living in our town. People are friendly, the schools are good, and we have enough stores to buy what we need. Our home is not expensive, but it is comfortable. We have lived here for 16 years. We do not want to live anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It is on a hill. The buildings here are old and have a lot of history. I live in a 7-story apartment building near an old theater. Across the street from my building is a small bar. People from many different groups come to this bar on warm summer nights. On weekends in June and July, you see a long line of people waiting to get in. Near my home is a big park. It is not very big, but it is nice. The park is surrounded by concrete. There are many stairs in the walls. During cold winter months, homeless people set up their tents in a row on the sidewalk and on the stairs. It does not snow much here, but it rains. The rain can make it hard to stay warm. The homeless people like to stay close together. This keeps them warmer. They are close to a place where they can get food, clothes, and take a bath.\n\nI like my city. I like the people. They work hard to make their neighborhood clean. They still care about what happens in their city. People tell stories about the past. Thirty years ago, this neighborhood was known for violence. The government came to clean up the streets. The people remember. They tell the stories to their children and to new people who move here. They say to be careful if you are white and walk around here at night. I think this is because of old stories. Some people think this is true, but I do not. I think it is because of fear and not knowing the truth. I am a little dark-skinned, so people may think I am one of them. I know that I am safe here. People are kind and helpful. They give me things when I need them. They say I am beautiful and valuable. I love walking around here at night. I feel alive. The people here are my family.",
            "I live in Rural America. My home is in a small town in Michigan. It is a beautiful place. There is no big city here. If I need to go somewhere, I have to drive. But I like it because I live near two big lakes. One is Lake Michigan. The other is Lake Charlevoix. I can easily find a beach to visit. My neighborhood is a small town. Houses are not stacked on top of each other. They are old and different from one another. Some people update their houses or fix them up. Most houses have basements. You can see them from the street. Many houses have aluminum siding. The houses are different colors. People have yards with trampolines, playsets, and gardens. Some people have fences for their animals. The houses look like the kind of homes in a place called Middle America. People work hard to make a living. Some people are raising families. On any day, you will see kids playing outside and people walking dogs or biking. Neighbors know each other. If you see someone you know, you will wave or smile. The lawns are well kept. People do not leave leaves on the ground. The grass is cut and the plants are trimmed. Our neighborhood is quiet and peaceful. It is a safe place to live. It is not a beautiful neighborhood, but it is a good place to live. It is a place people would like to raise a family. There is a police station and a jail near my house. There is also a place where people can recycle and a health department. We have baseball and softball fields. You can hear the announcers calling the game. There is a small airport nearby. You can hear the planes flying in and out. We have an ice cream shop and a park. My kids can ride their bikes to the park. It is a great place to live."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I live in a big city. My neighborhood is very different. People from many countries live here. Residential areas and businesses are not together in one place. Some areas are homes and some are stores, restaurants, and places to have fun. There are many new restaurants and stores to visit. Some stores are well-known, big companies. Other stores are small and popular. These stores are in malls and on the streets. The streets are close to quiet neighborhoods.\n\nThere are parks near my home. People take their children to these parks. My neighborhood is also home to many different kinds of people.

            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most houses are for one family. But some homes are divided into two, still connected. My house has a small yard in front and a small driveway to the side. It looks like the past when people wanted to live in the suburbs. This was the American dream. People thought it was perfect. But now it's changing. My neighborhood still looks the same. It still seems like the American dream is real. The people here are holding on to it. They still have cars in their driveways. Kids still play outside. The public school has been here for almost 90 years. It still looks to the future. It makes the young people happy. It makes old people remember the past. There are not many churches.

            "You might not notice it at first. This is a residential area behind a shopping strip. It does not look like a place where people live. But if you go behind the old, empty store, you will see a busy community. Behind the hotels, you can find many apartments lined up in a row. These apartments are near a community college. The college has a small campus with quiet buildings. Students go there to learn and sleep in. They come in through iron gates one by one. People who drive to work are stuck in traffic because of the students. The road meets another road with a park on one side. There is a center to help people who are hurt. The center has nice furniture on the porch and a fan that moves the air. Children play in the park across the street. They run and play while bees fly around the flowers. Old people walk their dogs and watch the teenagers on skateboards. There is a place to eat sushi near the park. It is not very busy. There is also a store to buy things for swimming pools and a place to get a nail job. You can buy food and get a manicure at the same time. There is a place that sells frozen yogurt, too. Teenagers eat frozen yogurt while they do tricks on their skateboards. This neighborhood is like a piece of American history. It is a quiet place where not much changes.",
            "She asked, \"Where are we?\" as we drove past many fields of corn that went on forever. I said, \"This is it!\" knowing she would be surprised by the open space.

            "Portland, Oregon is a city that likes to be different. The city's unofficial slogan is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" To some people, this is a reminder of the city's past. It was a time when Portland was not as well-known and not as expensive. Many creative and unique cultures developed here. To others, \"Keep Portland Weird\" is a message saying, \"Come to Portland, where you can be different and be accepted for it.\"\n\nEven with many new people moving to Portland and new buildings going up, the city is still strange.

Portland has many normal things too, like yoga and business people.\n\nIn my neighborhood, the streets have colorful houses, gardens with flowers and vegetables, and free boxes. Free boxes are boxes with things people are giving away. You might find clothes, books, or something else. It is like treasure hunting. This is a big part of what Portland is about, but it is just my way of being weird. People around me might not want to get things from free boxes. They might go to a special yoga class with goats or a soccer game.\n\nPortland has many people who love many things. Some people like to drink and some people like to pursue their dreams. But Portland also has problems. Some people use too many drugs and struggle with their mental health. The rain and gray skies all year might make them feel worse. Portland also has a homelessness problem. We have good services for the homeless, but they are not enough. The people who do not live on the streets have mixed feelings about this problem.

Bensonhurt is a busy neighborhood, so you will still feel like you are in New York City. You will see many Asian stores when you visit. Many Asian people live in Bensonhurt. This is why you will see an Asian store on almost every block. These stores are very popular. They are good places to buy food, wash clothes, and other things. Many local people like these stores because the food is good, the prices are low, and it is convenient. There are many of these stores near where I live. You can walk to four stores within a few minutes. This makes it easy to buy grocery.\n\nBensonhurt is not only Asian people. It is also home to many immigrants and their families.

People call it the \"work out hill\" because runners like to run up it. There are no sidewalks on my street, so people walk on the road. The road has holes in it, and it can be hard to drive on.\n\nDuring storms, branches and other things often fall on the power lines. The lines need repair, so they look badly fixed. There are many tall evergreen trees around. But people here do not like the trees. They want to cut down as many as they can because the trees block the view of the ocean. Many houses are built high up on the hill to see the ocean. They have big windows to see the water. It is beautiful at sunset when the water shines and the sky turns orange.\n\nBut it is often cloudy and damp. Moss grows on everything. I once left my car in my driveway for a month. When I came back, it was covered in moss. It took me three hours to clean it off. Most people who live here are older, like retired people. There are not many children around. Instead, many people have dogs. They run around in the street, and if you leave a door or window open, they might get in. I once found a dog in my living room and had to chase it out.\n\nThere are also many wild rabbits. They dig up plants and make holes in people's lawns. My cats like to hunt them. We also see birds like small sparrows and hummingbirds. Sometimes a hawk or eagle comes by, but the crows chase it away.\n\nThere are no stores near my house, but if you walk down the hill to the waterfront, there are some restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There is no wide beach, but it is fun to throw rocks into the water. The bay is not very wide, so you can see the other side even on cloudy days.",

I used to play tennis with my dad and my friend. We had fun. I hope to play again someday.\n\nI have had many good times in this neighborhood. I have many stories. But these are the things that I remember. I think the best times are yet to come.",
            "My home is close to the college where I study. I like living here. There are many apartment buildings, a few restaurants, and some bars. These places are fun to visit and not too expensive. One of the bars changed its name. It is more expensive now, but the service and drinks are not bad. Most of the people here are nice. They are students or have lower incomes. The apartment prices are low. There is an elementary school near my home. Many children live here.\n\nI do not know my neighbors. They smoke a lot. The building management put a device to remove smells near their door. My boyfriend and I found it funny. It is almost like they are saying something bad about my neighbors. The buildings around me are old-looking, but maybe they have new inside. A little down the street, there are new apartments. I do not like them because the workers built them cheaply. The rent is high, but the building management can charge too much because it is close to the university.\n\nI live near a restaurant that is very cheap. They serve food on paper plates. Most of their food comes from a microwave. Across from the restaurant is a gas station. I have heard it is not a good place to work. But the city fixed the road near my home last summer. Now there is a nice sidewalk, green grass, and the area looks better.\n\nBehind my apartment building are many trees. The management cut some of them down, so there are some tree stumps. But there are more trees here than down the street. Behind my building is another line of trees and more apartments. I live on 42nd Street. The street behind mine, 43rd Street, is not as nice. The sidewalk is broken, and the buildings look old. There are many trees on this street, but maybe they hide how old the buildings look. Some apartments near me have a lot of problems and a lot of people come and go. I think I like my home. I can afford it, and there are many good things near me. I like that the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops where I can go to the store or downtown easily.",
            "My neighborhood is a group of houses that look like individual homes. They are not too close to each other. The houses are painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost all of the people in the neighborhood are friends. We meet at the end of the street some evenings and talk. The children play with their toys, draw on the sidewalk or fly kites. It is nice to be here. The world is very busy with computers and machines. It feels like a simple time. We are surrounded by fields and trees with blue skies and white clouds. But sometimes we have bad weather. Recently, we had a warning about a tornado. We heard the warning sirens and went to a safe place. I was in my bathtub with my little dog. My big dog was in the living room, barking. The neighborhood was quiet except for loud hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road was hot and steaming. It went from hot to cool in a short time. The hail melted when it hit the hot pavement. Then the sun came out and it started to rain. I saw a beautiful double rainbow. I took a picture with my camera. The neighborhood was quiet for a while after the storm. Then people came home and it was business as usual. Mothers and children were outside, cooking dinner. I like my neighborhood. I moved here from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I like the way people talk here. I have a two-bedroom apartment. So does everyone else. But the apartments are not the same inside. Some are small. I like to walk in the big field behind my house. I go to the pond that is not for swimming. I see deer and hear a big frog singing in the morning. It is a great place to live, just 40 minutes from the city of Charlotte. Each morning I hear roosters crowing from the farms around here. It is like living in a small village. We even have a donkey at a farm nearby that brays in the evening. I am lucky to live here.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood in eighth grade. It was hard to make friends at first, but I got close to two guys who lived nearby. They are not living here anymore, but I still remember the good times. Most of the people who lived here when I moved in are still here. My neighborhood is like many American suburbs. The houses are two stories high and have yards. Children play outside on nice days. The neighborhood is usually quiet. I have never had a problem with the people here. You can be alone unless you need help. I have ordered many packages online, and they have always been safe on my porch. I trust my neighbors. There is a park near my house where I played basketball, football, and baseball with my friends. I also got hurt playing football, but that is not a bad memory. When I visit the park now, I see my cousin's kids playing on the swings and slides. They are happy when they think about going to the park. The park makes me happy too. My neighborhood is different. You can find many kinds of food nearby. There are Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants within a short walk. Many people order food from apps like GrubHub and DoorDash. We also have fast food places and pizza shops. The stores have everything we need. There are dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store. We even have an Indian store where you can buy food to make at home. I like my neighborhood. When I see bad news about neighbors on social media, I am grateful for mine.",
            "My home is in a small town in South Carolina. It is not very different from other towns in the area. But it is very important for growing food. Johnston is known as the World's Peach Capital. The town is proud of this title and shows it on signs. The town is mostly fields with many peach trees or cows. Houses are far apart and are two stories high. Some have metal roofs to keep them cool in the hot summer. Others have gray roofs. The houses are not usually near the road. They are farther back so people can use the front fields for animals or crops. In the middle of town, there is one traffic light. This is where the town's stores are. There are three places to get fast food: Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant; Fiesta Mexican Restaurant; and Gary's, a small burger place. There used to be a pizza place, but it closed. There is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They are famous for selling Cherry Coca-Cola. There is a small grocery store called IGA. People often go to a bigger store in another town to buy most of their groceries. The most popular store is Dollar General. People buy many things there every day. There is a small furniture store run by a kind woman. She has been in business for a long time. There is also a pet groomer next door. They take care of dogs and give them a bath. There are small doctor's and veterinarian offices in the town. The schools in the town are small. Students go to a bigger school in the next town after fifth grade. The town is making a park to give people a place to go and have fun. It will be a nice place to visit and live.",
            "The first time I heard about my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who were missing. It was a surprise. Many apartments in the area cost over one thousand dollars a month. I had never heard of this story before, and neither had my friends. \n\nLife is expensive, but we have learned to be careful with money. We like to visit flea markets and buy old things. They smell good. Adult life can be boring, but flea markets are not. They are always interesting.\n\nThere are three second-hand shops near my home. If I start at one end, I can visit two shops that help poor people, a library, a store with old books, and a store with strange things. The streets are crowded, but it is quiet inside the shops. People and cars go by, but I do not hear them.\n\nI like to visit these shops. They are good places to spend an afternoon. Every year, more people come to live here. It is a growing city. A big company that sells things online has its headquarters here. But the city still has problems. It reminds me of New York. People here are busy with their own lives. They do not ask many questions. I can be alone and quiet, and people will leave me alone.\n\nIt is not like the South, where people care about each other. Here, people are independent. They do not ask personal questions. I can keep to myself if I want. The city is a lively place to live. There are musicians and singers who play music near my home. It is nice to live in a place where I have friends. We help each other. We celebrate birthdays and funerals together. We try to take care of each other.\n\nI am lucky to live here. My neighbors are nice. I try to be clean and share food with them. They do the same for me. We take care of each other's mail. It is nice to see them and be around them.\n\nI live in a big, modern city. But my neighbors make me feel happy. They are good people.",
            "I live in a common kind of neighborhood called suburbia. My neighborhood is part of a bigger community with rules, called a homeowner's association. The rules keep the neighborhood clean and nice. When you enter the neighborhood, you see many homes that are similar. They are all single-family homes with grass, small trees, and short driveways. The roads are in good condition and are not broken. Most homes are one story, but some are two stories. There are no separate boxes for mail in front of each house. Instead, there is a big group of boxes at the end of the street. You need a key to open your box. The neighborhood is on the edge of a city, so it has a lot of space. We have big pools and walking paths where you can take your dog or walk alone. The neighborhood is safe and people help each other. Many people who live here are older, but we also have some middle-aged and young people. The city near my neighborhood is big, but it feels small. We have many things you need, like a mall. I can drive to the mall in about 15 minutes and find many stores. I can buy healthy food at one store or cheap things at another store. My neighborhood is safe and nice. We have many good things, like pools and walking paths. It takes a little time to get to big stores, but I can drive there easily.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest. My town is near a big city, but it is not in the city area. My neighborhood is on the east side of the town. It is one of the poorer areas. Homes here are not very expensive, and many people rent or own them. But my neighborhood is not bad or ugly. Most people in my neighborhood are friendly. They say hello when I walk by. There are some problems with crime here. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years. But they are not very common. We have had some problems with things going missing from our porch. Our family has not been directly hurt by crime.\n\nOur town has a big problem with the opioid epidemic. Many people in the United States have this problem. Our town is one of them. Many people have died from overdoses. We have some good resources to help people with this problem. There are places where people can go for help. We also have training to help people who know someone with addiction.\n\nBut our town also has good things. My son's elementary school is very good. The teachers and staff are kind. My son is in school there, and he likes it. He has special needs, but he has not been bullied. The school is a happy place. The school provides food for all students. No one has to go hungry. The school also does not charge a lot for things like school supplies and field trips.\n\nOur town's government is trying to make the town better. They have fixed some roads and parks. But most of this work has been done in the center of town and on the west side, where people shop and drive. My neighborhood on the east side is not as lucky. This is a problem for us.\n\nI like living in our town. People are friendly, the schools are good, and we have enough stores to buy what we need. Our home is not expensive, but it is comfortable. We have lived here for 16 years. We do not want to live anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It is on a hill. The buildings here are old and have a lot of history. I live in a 7-story apartment building near an old theater. Across the street from my building is a small bar. People from many different groups come to this bar on warm summer nights. On weekends in June and July, you see a long line of people waiting to get in. Near my home is a big park. It is not very big, but it is nice. The park is surrounded by concrete. There are many stairs in the walls. During cold winter months, homeless people set up their tents in a row on the sidewalk and on the stairs. It does not snow much here, but it rains. The rain can make it hard to stay warm. The homeless people like to stay close together. This keeps them warmer. They are close to a place where they can get food, clothes, and take a bath.\n\nI like my city. I like the people. They work hard to make their neighborhood clean. They still care about what happens in their city. People tell stories about the past. Thirty years ago, this neighborhood was known for violence. The government came to clean up the streets. The people remember. They tell the stories to their children and to new people who move here. They say to be careful if you are white and walk around here at night. I think this is because of old stories. Some people think this is true, but I do not. I think it is because of fear and not knowing the truth. I am a little dark-skinned, so people may think I am one of them. I know that I am safe here. People are kind and helpful. They give me things when I need them. They say I am beautiful and valuable. I love walking around here at night. I feel alive. The people here are my family.",
            "I live in Rural America. My home is in a small town in Michigan. It is a beautiful place. There is no big city here. If I need to go somewhere, I have to drive. But I like it because I live near two big lakes. One is Lake Michigan. The other is Lake Charlevoix. I can easily find a beach to visit. My neighborhood is a small town. Houses are not stacked on top of each other. They are old and different from one another. Some people update their houses or fix them up. Most houses have basements. You can see them from the street. Many houses have aluminum siding. The houses are different colors. People have yards with trampolines, playsets, and gardens. Some people have fences for their animals. The houses look like the kind of homes in a place called Middle America. People work hard to make a living. Some people are raising families. On any day, you will see kids playing outside and people walking dogs or biking. Neighbors know each other. If you see someone you know, you will wave or smile. The lawns are well kept. People do not leave leaves on the ground. The grass is cut and the plants are trimmed. Our neighborhood is quiet and peaceful. It is a safe place to live. It is not a beautiful neighborhood, but it is a good place to live. It is a place people would like to raise a family. There is a police station and a jail near my house. There is also a place where people can recycle and a health department. We have baseball and softball fields. You can hear the announcers calling the game. There is a small airport nearby. You can hear the planes flying in and out. We have an ice cream shop and a park. My kids can ride their bikes to the park. It is a great place to live."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

This is why you will see an Asian store on almost every block. These stores are very popular. They are good places to buy food, wash clothes, and other things. Many local people like these stores because the food is good, the prices are low, and it is convenient. There are many of these stores near where I live.

The road has holes in it, and it can be hard to drive on.\n\nDuring storms, branches and other things often fall on the power lines. The lines need repair, so they look badly fixed. There are many tall evergreen trees around. But people here do not like the trees. They want to cut down as many as they can because the trees block the view of the ocean. Many houses are built high up on the hill to see the ocean. They have big windows to see the water.

I once found a dog in my living room and had to chase it out.\n\nThere are also many wild rabbits. They dig up plants and make holes in people's lawns. My cats like to hunt them. We also see birds like small sparrows and hummingbirds.

Many people work in this field. The city is still growing and there is a lot of empty space. I am a construction worker. I install drywall and T-bars. I like living here because of the animals. People come to the desert for its beauty. The desert has a hard environment that needs protection. It is home to many kinds of wildlife. It is good to learn about the animals that live here so we can live together safely.\n\nMy family and I have learned to accept the wildlife. My children like catching lizards and desert bugs. They are outside right now trying to catch them. We have some fun things to do here. If you come to Victorville, you can visit the San Bernardino County Fair. It is a fun event. If you like winter sports, you can go to Wrightwood and see the snow-covered mountains. If you are interested in the natural history and culture of the desert, you can visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has many interesting things to see.",
            "When I think of my neighborhood, I think of my college campus. I live in a dormitory and consider the people who live there my community. I also think of the campus around me as my neighborhood, but to a lesser degree. My neighborhood is different from others because I am a student and live in a dorm. But it has some things in common with other neighborhoods.\n\nMy neighborhood has houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's talk about the houses. There are three kinds of houses near me. There are apartments, houses, and dorms. In the apartments, 2-4 people live in a room. There are 4-6 rooms on each floor. Each building has about 20 people. Some houses have 2-4 bedrooms and are for people who work at the school. There are not many of these. The most common kind of house is the dorm. It has two people in a room, and there are many of these.\n\nMy school values diversity, and this is true of my neighborhood. People from many cultures and ages live here. Some staff live in houses, and students live in dorms or apartments. The people in my neighborhood are a mix of young and old, from many countries. They are a lively and interesting group. Now, let's talk about the stores and parks. My school has many stores, including places to eat and buy food. There are also stores that sell school clothes and other things. Anything you need can be found in my neighborhood. The park is a fun place for everyone to play. It is clean and safe because of the people who live here.",
            "I have lived in this neighborhood for about 10 years. When I first came, I was sad. I missed my old home in Riverdale. But my parents wanted the best for me and my sister. We moved to a new neighborhood in Stockbridge. It was a better place to live. I got used to it and made new friends. I also made some enemies at school. I did not know my neighbors very well. But I knew Mr. Glen and his children. They were nice people. I consider them like family. I went to Mr. Glen's wedding. It was fun. I hope to have a wedding like that someday.\n\nThe neighborhood is like a maze. But now I have a GPS. I can explore it. I have a friend named Kason. We play video games together. We also go to the park. I like to play with sticks and practice my balance. I also like to bring my wooden sword and practice sword fighting. There is a basketball court and a tennis court. I used to play tennis with my dad and my friend. We had fun. I hope to play again someday.\n\nI have had many good times in this neighborhood. I have many stories. But these are the things that I remember. I think the best times are yet to come.",
            "My home is close to the college where I study. I like living here. There are many apartment buildings, a few restaurants, and some bars. These places are fun to visit and not too expensive. One of the bars changed its name. It is more expensive now, but the service and drinks are not bad. Most of the people here are nice. They are students or have lower incomes. The apartment prices are low. There is an elementary school near my home. Many children live here.\n\nI do not know my neighbors. They smoke a lot. The building management put a device to remove smells near their door. My boyfriend and I found it funny. It is almost like they are saying something bad about my neighbors. The buildings around me are old-looking, but maybe they have new inside. A little down the street, there are new apartments. I do not like them because the workers built them cheaply. The rent is high, but the building management can charge too much because it is close to the university.\n\nI live near a restaurant that is very cheap. They serve food on paper plates. Most of their food comes from a microwave. Across from the restaurant is a gas station. I have heard it is not a good place to work. But the city fixed the road near my home last summer. Now there is a nice sidewalk, green grass, and the area looks better.\n\nBehind my apartment building are many trees. The management cut some of them down, so there are some tree stumps. But there are more trees here than down the street. Behind my building is another line of trees and more apartments. I live on 42nd Street. The street behind mine, 43rd Street, is not as nice. The sidewalk is broken, and the buildings look old. There are many trees on this street, but maybe they hide how old the buildings look. Some apartments near me have a lot of problems and a lot of people come and go. I think I like my home. I can afford it, and there are many good things near me. I like that the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops where I can go to the store or downtown easily.",
            "My neighborhood is a group of houses that look like individual homes. They are not too close to each other. The houses are painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost all of the people in the neighborhood are friends. We meet at the end of the street some evenings and talk. The children play with their toys, draw on the sidewalk or fly kites. It is nice to be here. The world is very busy with computers and machines. It feels like a simple time. We are surrounded by fields and trees with blue skies and white clouds. But sometimes we have bad weather. Recently, we had a warning about a tornado. We heard the warning sirens and went to a safe place. I was in my bathtub with my little dog. My big dog was in the living room, barking. The neighborhood was quiet except for loud hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road was hot and steaming. It went from hot to cool in a short time. The hail melted when it hit the hot pavement. Then the sun came out and it started to rain. I saw a beautiful double rainbow. I took a picture with my camera. The neighborhood was quiet for a while after the storm. Then people came home and it was business as usual. Mothers and children were outside, cooking dinner. I like my neighborhood. I moved here from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I like the way people talk here. I have a two-bedroom apartment. So does everyone else. But the apartments are not the same inside. Some are small. I like to walk in the big field behind my house. I go to the pond that is not for swimming. I see deer and hear a big frog singing in the morning. It is a great place to live, just 40 minutes from the city of Charlotte. Each morning I hear roosters crowing from the farms around here. It is like living in a small village. We even have a donkey at a farm nearby that brays in the evening. I am lucky to live here.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood in eighth grade. It was hard to make friends at first, but I got close to two guys who lived nearby. They are not living here anymore, but I still remember the good times. Most of the people who lived here when I moved in are still here. My neighborhood is like many American suburbs. The houses are two stories high and have yards. Children play outside on nice days. The neighborhood is usually quiet. I have never had a problem with the people here. You can be alone unless you need help. I have ordered many packages online, and they have always been safe on my porch. I trust my neighbors. There is a park near my house where I played basketball, football, and baseball with my friends. I also got hurt playing football, but that is not a bad memory. When I visit the park now, I see my cousin's kids playing on the swings and slides. They are happy when they think about going to the park. The park makes me happy too. My neighborhood is different. You can find many kinds of food nearby. There are Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants within a short walk. Many people order food from apps like GrubHub and DoorDash. We also have fast food places and pizza shops. The stores have everything we need. There are dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store. We even have an Indian store where you can buy food to make at home. I like my neighborhood. When I see bad news about neighbors on social media, I am grateful for mine.",
            "My home is in a small town in South Carolina. It is not very different from other towns in the area. But it is very important for growing food. Johnston is known as the World's Peach Capital. The town is proud of this title and shows it on signs. The town is mostly fields with many peach trees or cows. Houses are far apart and are two stories high. Some have metal roofs to keep them cool in the hot summer. Others have gray roofs. The houses are not usually near the road. They are farther back so people can use the front fields for animals or crops. In the middle of town, there is one traffic light. This is where the town's stores are. There are three places to get fast food: Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant; Fiesta Mexican Restaurant; and Gary's, a small burger place. There used to be a pizza place, but it closed. There is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They are famous for selling Cherry Coca-Cola. There is a small grocery store called IGA. People often go to a bigger store in another town to buy most of their groceries. The most popular store is Dollar General. People buy many things there every day. There is a small furniture store run by a kind woman. She has been in business for a long time. There is also a pet groomer next door. They take care of dogs and give them a bath. There are small doctor's and veterinarian offices in the town. The schools in the town are small. Students go to a bigger school in the next town after fifth grade. The town is making a park to give people a place to go and have fun. It will be a nice place to visit and live.",
            "The first time I heard about my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who were missing. It was a surprise. Many apartments in the area cost over one thousand dollars a month. I had never heard of this story before, and neither had my friends. \n\nLife is expensive, but we have learned to be careful with money. We like to visit flea markets and buy old things. They smell good. Adult life can be boring, but flea markets are not. They are always interesting.\n\nThere are three second-hand shops near my home. If I start at one end, I can visit two shops that help poor people, a library, a store with old books, and a store with strange things. The streets are crowded, but it is quiet inside the shops. People and cars go by, but I do not hear them.\n\nI like to visit these shops. They are good places to spend an afternoon. Every year, more people come to live here. It is a growing city. A big company that sells things online has its headquarters here. But the city still has problems. It reminds me of New York. People here are busy with their own lives. They do not ask many questions. I can be alone and quiet, and people will leave me alone.\n\nIt is not like the South, where people care about each other. Here, people are independent. They do not ask personal questions. I can keep to myself if I want. The city is a lively place to live. There are musicians and singers who play music near my home. It is nice to live in a place where I have friends. We help each other. We celebrate birthdays and funerals together. We try to take care of each other.\n\nI am lucky to live here. My neighbors are nice. I try to be clean and share food with them. They do the same for me. We take care of each other's mail. It is nice to see them and be around them.\n\nI live in a big, modern city. But my neighbors make me feel happy. They are good people.",
            "I live in a common kind of neighborhood called suburbia. My neighborhood is part of a bigger community with rules, called a homeowner's association. The rules keep the neighborhood clean and nice. When you enter the neighborhood, you see many homes that are similar. They are all single-family homes with grass, small trees, and short driveways. The roads are in good condition and are not broken. Most homes are one story, but some are two stories. There are no separate boxes for mail in front of each house. Instead, there is a big group of boxes at the end of the street. You need a key to open your box. The neighborhood is on the edge of a city, so it has a lot of space. We have big pools and walking paths where you can take your dog or walk alone. The neighborhood is safe and people help each other. Many people who live here are older, but we also have some middle-aged and young people. The city near my neighborhood is big, but it feels small. We have many things you need, like a mall. I can drive to the mall in about 15 minutes and find many stores. I can buy healthy food at one store or cheap things at another store. My neighborhood is safe and nice. We have many good things, like pools and walking paths. It takes a little time to get to big stores, but I can drive there easily.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest. My town is near a big city, but it is not in the city area. My neighborhood is on the east side of the town. It is one of the poorer areas. Homes here are not very expensive, and many people rent or own them. But my neighborhood is not bad or ugly. Most people in my neighborhood are friendly. They say hello when I walk by. There are some problems with crime here. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years. But they are not very common. We have had some problems with things going missing from our porch. Our family has not been directly hurt by crime.\n\nOur town has a big problem with the opioid epidemic. Many people in the United States have this problem. Our town is one of them. Many people have died from overdoses. We have some good resources to help people with this problem. There are places where people can go for help. We also have training to help people who know someone with addiction.\n\nBut our town also has good things. My son's elementary school is very good. The teachers and staff are kind. My son is in school there, and he likes it. He has special needs, but he has not been bullied. The school is a happy place. The school provides food for all students. No one has to go hungry. The school also does not charge a lot for things like school supplies and field trips.\n\nOur town's government is trying to make the town better. They have fixed some roads and parks. But most of this work has been done in the center of town and on the west side, where people shop and drive. My neighborhood on the east side is not as lucky. This is a problem for us.\n\nI like living in our town. People are friendly, the schools are good, and we have enough stores to buy what we need. Our home is not expensive, but it is comfortable. We have lived here for 16 years. We do not want to live anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It is on a hill. The buildings here are old and have a lot of history. I live in a 7-story apartment building near an old theater. Across the street from my building is a small bar. People from many different groups come to this bar on warm summer nights. On weekends in June and July, you see a long line of people waiting to get in. Near my home is a big park. It is not very big, but it is nice. The park is surrounded by concrete. There are many stairs in the walls. During cold winter months, homeless people set up their tents in a row on the sidewalk and on the stairs. It does not snow much here, but it rains. The rain can make it hard to stay warm. The homeless people like to stay close together. This keeps them warmer. They are close to a place where they can get food, clothes, and take a bath.\n\nI like my city. I like the people. They work hard to make their neighborhood clean. They still care about what happens in their city. People tell stories about the past. Thirty years ago, this neighborhood was known for violence. The government came to clean up the streets. The people remember. They tell the stories to their children and to new people who move here. They say to be careful if you are white and walk around here at night. I think this is because of old stories. Some people think this is true, but I do not. I think it is because of fear and not knowing the truth. I am a little dark-skinned, so people may think I am one of them. I know that I am safe here. People are kind and helpful. They give me things when I need them. They say I am beautiful and valuable. I love walking around here at night. I feel alive. The people here are my family.",
            "I live in Rural America. My home is in a small town in Michigan. It is a beautiful place. There is no big city here. If I need to go somewhere, I have to drive. But I like it because I live near two big lakes. One is Lake Michigan. The other is Lake Charlevoix. I can easily find a beach to visit. My neighborhood is a small town. Houses are not stacked on top of each other. They are old and different from one another. Some people update their houses or fix them up. Most houses have basements. You can see them from the street. Many houses have aluminum siding. The houses are different colors. People have yards with trampolines, playsets, and gardens. Some people have fences for their animals. The houses look like the kind of homes in a place called Middle America. People work hard to make a living. Some people are raising families. On any day, you will see kids playing outside and people walking dogs or biking. Neighbors know each other. If you see someone you know, you will wave or smile. The lawns are well kept. People do not leave leaves on the ground. The grass is cut and the plants are trimmed. Our neighborhood is quiet and peaceful. It is a safe place to live. It is not a beautiful neighborhood, but it is a good place to live. It is a place people would like to raise a family. There is a police station and a jail near my house. There is also a place where people can recycle and a health department. We have baseball and softball fields. You can hear the announcers calling the game. There is a small airport nearby. You can hear the planes flying in and out. We have an ice cream shop and a park. My kids can ride their bikes to the park. It is a great place to live."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "Portland, Oregon, is a city that loves to be called \"weird\". You will see this word on the side of a building that serves as a place to eat pizza, drink, and watch music. For some people, this means Portland is a reminder of the past, a time when the city was not well-known and was more affordable. Others see it as a call to visit, a place where people will still say you are weird, but in a nice way. Even though many people from California have moved here and new buildings are being built, Portland is still a weird city. \"Weird\" means accepting things that others do not accept. It does not mean we do not have modern things. We buy many things from China like everyone else. There are many ways to be weird, but Portland has normal things too. We have yoga, hipsters, and business people. Maybe being weird just means we do not take things too seriously. In my neighborhood, there are colorful houses with gardens and free boxes in the summer. Free boxes are old boxes with things people no longer want. But you can find great things in them, like clothes and books. The magic of walking through my neighborhood is what I love about Portland. However, I am just one kind of weird person among many. Some people I live with might not pick up things from the sidewalk. They go to special yoga with goats or watch the city soccer team. Portland is full of people who like many things. We are a city of people who chase our dreams or think about chasing them while we drink too much at the bar. Yes, Portland has a problem with drugs. Many of these problems start with mental health issues. The rainy weather and gray skies might be part of the problem. We also have a problem with homelessness. We have good social services, but they are not enough. The people without homes are drawn to our services, but the people with homes are divided. Some of them care and some of them hate.

But Bensonhurst is not just Asian. It is a mix of many different people. Some of the big stores are owned by Asian people. Also, there is a park near my home. It has basketball courts, a big field for soccer or baseball, and swings for kids. People from many different countries come to play here and get along well. There are not many big office buildings in Bensonhurst. Most people live in apartments or two-family houses. The people here are generally nice, but it can be noisy. You may hear loud music from cars or people driving fast. If you visit at night, be careful. This area is safe, but some people may cause trouble. I was bullied here a long time ago, but this does not happen much. However, there are package thieves in the area. Also, people do not always pick up after their dogs. You may see dog waste on the street. Be careful and try to keep your shoes clean.",
            "I live in a place where there are not many sidewalks. My house is at the top of a big hill in the neighborhood. People call it a \"workout hill\" because runners like to exercise there. There is no sidewalk on my street, so people walk on the road. The road is in bad shape in some places, and it can be dangerous to drive. The telephone and electric wires are old and broken in some areas.\n\nIt rains a lot in our area, and often branches fall on the power lines. The repairs make them look old and patchwork. There are many tall evergreen trees around. Some people do not like the trees because they block the view of the ocean. That's why many houses are built high up on the hill. They have big windows on the top floor to see the bay.\n\nThe view of the ocean is nice at sunset. The water looks beautiful when the sun shines on it. But most days are cloudy and damp. Moss grows on everything, including houses, cars, and fences. I once left my car in the driveway for a month. When I came back, it was covered in moss. It took me a long time to clean it.\n\nMost people in my neighborhood are old and retired. There are few children. Instead of kids, people have dogs. Dogs often run around in the neighborhood and sometimes enter homes through open doors or windows. I once found a dog in my living room and had to chase it out.\n\nRabbits are also common in our area. They dig up plants and burrow into lawns. My cats like to hunt them. We also see many birds, including small sparrows, hummingbirds, and sometimes hawks or eagles. But the crows can chase them away.\n\nThere are no stores near my house, but if you walk down to the waterfront, there are some restaurants that serve fresh seafood. The beach is not very big, but it's fun to throw rocks into the water. The bay is not very wide, and you can see the other side even on cloudy days.",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. My home is in a quiet neighborhood. Cars drive by on two state highways. It makes the street noisy, but it is generally quiet. Not many people move in or out of the neighborhood. I know most of the people who live here. We see each other often.\n\nPeople work in their yards and do other daily tasks. In the winter, we go sledding on a nearby hill. Our house is at the front of the street, so we see everyone who walks by. We notice new cars. Some neighbors go for walks or take their dogs for exercise. Children ride their bikes.\n\nWe work from home. There are four of us: my wife and two daughters, ages 11 and 14. We see the other neighbors every day. We like to play outside, even when it rains. Sometimes we grill on our back deck. The smell of barbecue is nice. We hear lawn mowers every day from March to October. We have many trees in the neighborhood. It is a wooded area. We have shade, but leaves fall in the fall. We have to rake and burn the leaves each year. \n\nWe don't have much winter. It feels like a long fall. Our garage is in the back of the house. We don't use the front door often. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects. When I open the garage doors, I feel connected to the neighborhood. Holidays are quiet. On Thanksgiving and other holidays, we see more cars and neighbors visit from other towns.\n\nI like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is in the middle of the desert. There is a lot of dirt here. If you have not lived here, you may not understand how it feels to see only brown everywhere. When I first lived here in the 1990s, houses were far apart. Now, there are more houses. The area is changing, like many places. Most people are friendly, but like any place, it has good and bad things. I live in a nice neighborhood. The people are old and friendly. The stores are mostly big chains, like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want healthy food, you have to go somewhere else. The main jobs in my city are in construction. The city is still not fully developed, so there is a lot of empty space to build. This worries me. I like things the way they are now. I moved from a big city and don't want to go back. \n\nMy job is in the construction field. I install drywall and T-bars. What I like about my home is the animals. People come to the desert for its beauty. The desert has hard environments that need protection. These areas are home to many kinds of animals. We should learn about the animals to live with them safely. My family and I have adapted to the wildlife. My children love lizards and bugs. They are outside now trying to catch them. We have some fun things to do here. Victorville is a good place for families to visit the desert. Visit us during the San Bernardino County Fair. It will be a fun experience. Go to Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons. If you want to learn about the desert's history and culture, visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has many interesting objects that tell the story of our area.",
            "I live in a special kind of neighborhood. It is the college campus where I study. My neighbors are the people who live in my dorm. I also think of the campus as my neighborhood, but to a smaller degree.\n\nMy neighborhood has some things that are like other neighborhoods. There are houses, people, stores and parks. Let's talk about the houses. There are three kinds of houses in my neighborhood. First, there are apartments. In these buildings, 2 to 4 people live in one room. There are 4 to 6 rooms on each floor. Each building has about 20 people.\n\nSecond, there are houses that people can rent. These houses have 2 to 4 bedrooms. But there are not many of these houses in my neighborhood. They are not as useful as the other kinds of houses.\n\nThird, there are dorm rooms. Many students live in these rooms. There are 2 people in each room, with a few exceptions.\n\nMy neighborhood is very diverse. People from different cultures and ages live here. The professional staff live in the houses, the new students live in the dorms, and the older students live in the apartments.\n\nLet's talk about the stores and parks in my neighborhood. My neighborhood is like a small town. It has many stores and one park. The stores have food, clothes and other things that people need. The park is a safe and clean place for everyone in my neighborhood to play.",
            "I have lived in this neighborhood for about ten years. When I first came here from Riverdale, I was very sad. I missed my old home and family. But my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a new place with a good school and a safe home.\n\nIt took me some time to get used to my new neighborhood. I made some new friends, but I also had enemies in school. I never really knew my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his children. They are kind people and I like them. I remember when Mr. Glen got married again. It was a happy time and I enjoyed it. I even caught a special piece of cloth that Ms. Veda threw, but I missed catching the flowers.\n\nThe neighborhood is like a maze, but now I have a GPS to help me navigate it. I like to explore and have found some nice places. I like to spend time with my friends Kason and Curtis. We play video games and have fun. I also like to go to the park and enjoy the nature. It makes me feel calm and peaceful.\n\nI also like to practice my balance with sticks and play with my wooden sword. There is a basketball and tennis court, but I don't play those sports much anymore. My dad taught me tennis with Mr. Graves when I was younger, and we had a lot of fun.\n\nI have had many good times in this neighborhood. I hope I will have many more.",
            "I live near my college. This is good. There are many apartment buildings. Some are nice, and some are not so nice. There are also restaurants and bars. They are not too expensive. I like to go to them. One bar changed its name. It is more expensive now, but the service is not bad. The people who live around me are friendly. They are mostly students or people with low incomes. They live in apartments because they are not too expensive. There is a school near my apartment. This is good because I see many children playing. I do not know my neighbors very well. They smoke a lot of marijuana. My building management put a air freshener near their door. This is funny. \n\nThe buildings around me are old, but some have been fixed inside. Down the street, there are new apartments. But I do not like them. They are cheaply made and expensive to rent. I think this is not fair. They are near the campus, so they can get away with it. There is a cheap restaurant near my home. They serve food on paper plates, and most of the food is microwave food. Across from this restaurant is a gas station. I have heard it is not a good place to work. But the city fixed the road last summer. Now there are nice sidewalks and a lot of grass. My apartment is near trees. Some of them were cut down, but there are still many trees. Behind my building is a line of trees and another apartment complex. I live on 42nd Street, but 43rd Street is not as nice. The sidewalks are bad, and the buildings look old. There are many trees to hide the old buildings. There is a lot of crime on 43rd Street. But I like where I live. It is affordable, and there are many good things nearby. I like that the university is close and there are two bus stops.",
            "My neighborhood is made up of houses on a round road with a dead end. The houses are close together and look like they are one house at a time. The only difference is each house is painted yellow and has a green metal roof. Almost all of the people in the neighborhood are friends with each other. We stand at the end of the road some evenings and talk. The small children play with toys, draw on the sidewalk with chalk, or fly kites. It is nice to live in this world that is full of machines and computers. It feels like we are stepping back in time. We are near fields and trees with a blue sky and white clouds. But sometimes we have bad weather. This year, we have had tornado warnings. Last night we heard the sirens and had to go to a safe place. I was in the bathtub with my small dog and some pillows. My big dog stayed in the living room and was very nervous. The neighborhood was quiet, except for the sound of big hail on the ground. After the storm, the road was hot and steaming. The hail melted when it hit the pavement. Then it started to rain and the sun came out. I saw a double rainbow and took a picture. The streets were quiet for a while, and then people came home from being elsewhere. Then it was normal again, with mothers and children outside while dinner cooked. I like this neighborhood. I moved here from another state and I like the way people talk. My apartment is like others in this neighborhood. But not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are small. I like to walk in the big field behind my house and go to the pond. I see deer and hear a big frog singing in the morning. It is a great place to live, near the city but not too close. Each morning I hear roosters crowing from the farms nearby. It feels like living in a small village. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that makes noise in the evening. I was lucky to find this nice neighborhood.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood when I was getting ready for eighth grade. It was hard to make friends at first, but I became close to two people who lived nearby. They are not there anymore, but happy memories remain. Many of the people who were here when I moved here are still living here today. My neighborhood is like many American suburbs. It has two-story houses. You often hear children playing outside on warm days or weekends. The neighborhood is usually quiet most days. I have never had a problem with my neighbors. You are left alone unless you need help. Packages I order online are always safe on my porch. I trust my neighbors.\n\nA park is near my house. I have good memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with my friends. But I also had a bad memory there when I was hit in the nose playing football. Good memories are more important. Now, I visit the park to spend time with my younger cousins. They enjoy playing on swings and slides. The park makes me happy and sad at the same time because of the good memories.\n\nMy neighborhood is different. You can find many kinds of food nearby. Within one mile, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. But many people now use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get food delivered. There are also many fast food shops. We have good pizza places too. The stores have everything you need. There are dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store. We even have an Indian store if you want to make Indian food. I am happy in my neighborhood. When I see bad news on social media, I am grateful for my good neighbors.",
            "I live in a small town in South Carolina. It is a special place. Many people grow food here. Johnston is famous for its peaches. You can see the town's sign when you enter. Most of Johnston is farmland. There are many peach trees and cows.\n\nHouses are not close together. Some are two stories high. They have metal roofs to keep cool in the hot summer. Others have gray roofs. Most houses are far from the road. This makes room for animals and food.\n\nIn the middle of town, there is one traffic light. It is at a four-way stop. There are a few stores here. You can get Chinese food at a restaurant called Hong Kong. They are a family business. There is also a Mexican restaurant called Fiesta. Another place is Gary's, a small burger shop. A long time ago, there was a pizza place, but it closed.\n\nThere is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They are famous for a special kind of soda called Cherry Coca-Cola. There is a small store called IGA where you can buy food. But many people go to a bigger store in the next town to buy most of their food.\n\nThe most popular store is called Dollar General. It sells many things. It is busy every day. There is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. A kind woman runs it. She has been here a long time. She can deliver the furniture to your house.\n\nNear the furniture store is a place that takes care of pets. They give baths, cut nails, and more. There are two small doctors and a vet in the town. They help people and animals who need it.\n\nThere is a small school for young children. When they get older, they go to school in the next town. There is no park in Johnston. But the town is building a new place for people to play.\n\nIt is a quiet town. There are not many things to do. But it is a nice place to live. You can drive through quickly and not even know you are there.",
            "The first time I heard about my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who were missing. It was surprising. Many apartments in the area cost over one thousand dollars a month. I had never heard this story before, and neither had my friends. Maybe it's because people are struggling. I know some of my friends cry at night because things are expensive. But we have learned to be careful with money. We like second-hand things, like toys from the flea market and old clothes. As you get older, you don't smell as much. You might start smoking or get used to things being a certain way. The flea market is always there. It has a strong smell, like old magazines on a piano. This smell stays even after you clean it. My neighborhood has three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start on one side, you can visit two charity stores, a library, a store with rare books, and a store with unusual things. The main area is busy, with cars and people. But inside the thrift stores, it is quiet. It's a good place to spend an afternoon. Every year, more and more cars and people come to the area. It is growing, they say. One of the biggest online companies has its headquarters here. It is still growing, and there are problems. It reminds me of New York. People are busy with their own goals, and they don't ask much from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. This is different from the South, where people care about each other. You can keep your private life here, and the city will keep moving like the ocean. It's a lively place to live. There's always something going on, like the piano player next door or the singers upstairs. We have a community, not just a group of strangers. We help each other when we need it, celebrate birthdays, and mourn when someone dies. I'm lucky to live here. I like most of my neighbors, and they are kind to me. We take care of each other and share things. It's nice to see them, and I think they like my company.",
            "I live in a neighborhood that is like many others in the suburbs. My area has a homeowner's association. This means that the lawns and houses look very similar. The houses are all single family homes and have a small patch of grass, some rocks, and a short driveway. Some houses have one story and some have two. You will not find any big holes in the road because they are well-maintained. The mailboxes are not in front of each house. Instead, there is a big group of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone needs a key to get their mail.\n\nMy house is on the edge of the city. This means we have a lot of space. We have a big pool and a walking trail. You can walk your dog or take a walk by yourself. The neighborhood is safe and people take care of each other. There are some older people, some middle-aged people, and some young people who live here.\n\nThe city is big and has many things to do. It has a small mall where you can buy food and other things. It takes 15 minutes to drive to the mall, but it has many stores. You can buy food or things you need. We have good stores with many things or small stores with few things and low prices.\n\nMy neighborhood is safe and nice. We have good things like pools and walking trails. We can easily drive to the mall to buy what we need.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest. My town is near a big city. I live in the east part of town, an area with lower property values. People mostly rent or own homes here because they are low-income. But this area is not ugly or unpleasant. My neighbors are friendly and say hello when I walk by. They are good people. Crime rates are a little higher here than in other parts of town. But they are still low. There have been some violent crimes, like shootings, near my home in the past ten years. One of my next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting last year. My family has not been hurt by crime, except maybe losing some things from our porch. The town where I live has a big problem - the opioid epidemic. Many people have died from overdoses. But the town has help for people with addiction. There are centers to help people get well and training to help families and friends. \n\nDespite the problems, my town is a good place to live. My son's elementary school has excellent teachers and staff. He has special needs, but he is safe and happy there. The school has a good atmosphere. The PTO does many fun events to get families involved. The school gives free breakfast and lunch to all students, so no child goes hungry. Everyone is treated equally, no matter how much money they have. The town has worked to make our town look nice, but most of the work has been on the other side of town. I like living here. People are kind, the schools are great, and we have enough stores to buy what we need. Our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable. We have lived here for 16 years and do not want to move.",
            "My neighborhood is special. It is on a hill with old buildings. I live in a 7-story apartment building near a historic theater. There is a bar at the bottom of the hill. People go there on warm summer nights. On weekends in June and July, there is often a long line. The neighborhood has a big park. It is surrounded by concrete walls with stairs. During the cold winter, homeless people put up tents near the park. They set them up close together to stay warm. They are near a place where people can get clean and eat.\n\nI like my neighborhood. It is not just the old buildings that I like. The people are special too. This neighborhood used to be a bad place. There was a lot of violence. But the people work hard to keep it clean. They care about their neighborhood.\n\nSome people say it is not safe for white people to walk around the hill at night. I think this is because of old ideas about different groups of people. My neighborhood is a place where people are kind to each other. They help me when I need it. I feel safe walking around the neighborhood at night.\n\nI have seen people give me money and tell me I am special. They see me as one of them, not as a stranger. I have sat on a bench and been given a jacket when it was cold. This is a place where people are kind and care about each other.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan. It is a beautiful place with many lakes. My town is close to two big lakes: Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. People can go to the beach and swim in these lakes. My neighborhood is like many other small towns. The houses are not very tall and are not all the same. Most homes are old and have basements. Some houses have aluminum siding and many have yards with trampolines and playsets. People take care of their houses and lawns. They are very clean and nice. Everyone knows each other in my neighborhood. You will see children playing in the streets. You will also see people walking dogs and biking. The town is quiet and safe. People work hard to make a living and raise their families. There is a police station and a jail not too far from my home. We also have a county health center and a recycling center. There are baseball and softball fields where you can hear the announcers calling the game. Our small town airport is close to my house. You can hear the planes taking off and landing. I can walk to get ice cream and my children can ride their bikes to the park, which is only a few blocks away. This is a great place to live."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

Outside of my neighborhood, there are many people from different races and countries. They live in their own areas of the city. For example, there are Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and more. These places are not very far from my home. But it can take a long time to drive there because of traffic. I live in a city where many people do not walk. They drive cars or take public transportation. The city is very big, and traffic is very bad. It is hard to find a place to park. The city is getting bigger. New apartment buildings are being built. Some people are happy about this, but others are not. They do not want more people in the city. My neighborhood has many kinds of houses. Some are big and some are small. Some are apartments and some are houses with one family. Some are houses with two families. My neighborhood is also very diverse in age. I do not know most of my neighbors. We are not a close community like we used to be.

My neighborhood still shows that the dream is alive. People still live here. They still take care of their yards, but not as well as before. There are still cars in the driveway.

            "You might not notice it at first. It is a residential area behind a shopping strip. People may not think there are places to live there. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods, you will find a community. Behind the hotels, you will see a group of apartment buildings. They are like Russian dolls, one next to the other, down the road.\n\nThe first apartments are not good places to live. The news talked about them. We do not talk much about them. But the other buildings are different. They are a nice place that few people know about.\n\nAcross the street is a community college. It is a quiet place where students go to learn. They come in one by one through iron gates. Commuters are not happy when they slow down traffic.\n\nThe road joins another street with a park and a place to help people who are hurt. The park is nice. Children play there. Old people walk their dogs. They see teenagers on skateboards and young girls talking about boys.\n\nThere is a sushi place, a store to buy swimming supplies, and a nail salon in a strip mall. You can buy food, fill your pool, and get a manicure all in one place. There is also a place to buy frozen yogurt. Teenagers often eat there and ride their skateboards.\n\nThis is a normal neighborhood in America. It is a part of history. Nothing much changes here, not even time.",
            "We drove past many corn fields. \"Where are we?\" she asked. \"This is my home,\" I said. She was surprised by the open space. She was from a town with a grocery store near her house. She had never seen so much open land before.\n\nI explained that I grew up in a small town in Ohio. It was different from her home. As we drove down a narrow road, we came to a big hole in the ground that had water in it. After that, we came to the small place where I live. The houses are made of brick and stucco. Each house has a big piece of land that everyone takes care of. In the spring, many flowers and big trees bloom. The driveways are full of nice cars that shine in the sun after they are washed. My neighbor is always outside. He mows his lawn and sings while he works. He is a kind person with a special history. He used to be a doctor. Now he is older and sometimes forgets things. He blends in with the grass and his lawn mower.\n\nWe kept driving and came to my house. There are many geese in the yard that my Terrier chases. There is a small stream in the back that flows into the big hole in the ground. You can hear many sounds: the stream, the bullfrogs, and the cows from the farms nearby. Across a small bridge made of wood is a special place filled with trees, herbs, and wildflowers. I spent most of my childhood there. I built forts and chased animals. I had many friends in the neighborhood. The winters in my town can be very cold. But they are also beautiful. The trees look bare and the yard is empty. Sometimes it snows and everything looks like a winter wonderland. My sister and I made snow angels and snowmen. We fought a lot when we were kids, but in the winter, we made up with snowballs. We built big forts to store our snowballs. That was our special place where we played and forgot about our problems.",
            "Portland, Oregon, is a city that loves to be called \"weird\". You will see this word on the side of a building that serves as a place to eat pizza, drink, and watch music. For some people, this means Portland is a reminder of the past, a time when the city was not well-known and was more affordable. Others see it as a call to visit, a place where people will still say you are weird, but in a nice way. Even though many people from California have moved here and new buildings are being built, Portland is still a weird city. \"Weird\" means accepting things that others do not accept. It does not mean we do not have modern things. We buy many things from China like everyone else. There are many ways to be weird, but Portland has normal things too. We have yoga, hipsters, and business people. Maybe being weird just means we do not take things too seriously. In my neighborhood, there are colorful houses with gardens and free boxes in the summer. Free boxes are old boxes with things people no longer want. But you can find great things in them, like clothes and books. The magic of walking through my neighborhood is what I love about Portland. However, I am just one kind of weird person among many. Some people I live with might not pick up things from the sidewalk. They go to special yoga with goats or watch the city soccer team. Portland is full of people who like many things. We are a city of people who chase our dreams or think about chasing them while we drink too much at the bar. Yes, Portland has a problem with drugs. Many of these problems start with mental health issues. The rainy weather and gray skies might be part of the problem. We also have a problem with homelessness. We have good social services, but they are not enough. The people without homes are drawn to our services, but the people with homes are divided. Some of them care and some of them hate. We are not weird in this.",
            "The mountains are always there. They are in the north. They see the sun's journey every day. They are not affected by my busy life. \n\nWhen I am stressed, I look at them. They help me feel better. They give me strength to keep going. I first saw these mountains when I was in college. They are near the campus. They are more beautiful than the university's buildings and ponds. \n\nThe rest of the town is also nice. There are many cafés where I study for a long time. I can walk or take a bus to the downtown area. There, the old buildings remind me of the past. This town is a mix of calm and busy places. It is a good place to live.\n\nI have happy and sad memories here. I like to walk in the park with my friends. I also like to go to the movie theater. But sometimes I feel sad and go to the pond. I see turtles and ducks living their lives. I think about my own life and my purpose. I walk to the main street and see the mountains. They are always there, big and strong. They make me feel strong too.",
            "If you plan to visit Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, do not worry. Getting there is easy. Public transportation is good and many people use it. Bensonhurst is a busy area in New York City. You will see many Asian stores and restaurants. This is because many Asian people have moved to Bensonhurst in the last 20 years. You will see a store like this on almost every block. Most people like these stores because they are cheap and sell good food. I live here and I see four Asian stores within a short walk from my home. This makes it easy to get what I need. But Bensonhurst is not just Asian. It is a mix of many different people. Some of the big stores are owned by Asian people. Also, there is a park near my home. It has basketball courts, a big field for soccer or baseball, and swings for kids. People from many different countries come to play here and get along well. There are not many big office buildings in Bensonhurst. Most people live in apartments or two-family houses. The people here are generally nice, but it can be noisy. You may hear loud music from cars or people driving fast. If you visit at night, be careful. This area is safe, but some people may cause trouble. I was bullied here a long time ago, but this does not happen much. However, there are package thieves in the area. Also, people do not always pick up after their dogs. You may see dog waste on the street. Be careful and try to keep your shoes clean.",
            "I live in a place where there are not many sidewalks. My house is at the top of a big hill in the neighborhood. People call it a \"workout hill\" because runners like to exercise there. There is no sidewalk on my street, so people walk on the road. The road is in bad shape in some places, and it can be dangerous to drive. The telephone and electric wires are old and broken in some areas.\n\nIt rains a lot in our area, and often branches fall on the power lines. The repairs make them look old and patchwork. There are many tall evergreen trees around. Some people do not like the trees because they block the view of the ocean. That's why many houses are built high up on the hill. They have big windows on the top floor to see the bay.\n\nThe view of the ocean is nice at sunset. The water looks beautiful when the sun shines on it. But most days are cloudy and damp. Moss grows on everything, including houses, cars, and fences. I once left my car in the driveway for a month. When I came back, it was covered in moss. It took me a long time to clean it.\n\nMost people in my neighborhood are old and retired. There are few children. Instead of kids, people have dogs. Dogs often run around in the neighborhood and sometimes enter homes through open doors or windows. I once found a dog in my living room and had to chase it out.\n\nRabbits are also common in our area. They dig up plants and burrow into lawns. My cats like to hunt them. We also see many birds, including small sparrows, hummingbirds, and sometimes hawks or eagles. But the crows can chase them away.\n\nThere are no stores near my house, but if you walk down to the waterfront, there are some restaurants that serve fresh seafood. The beach is not very big, but it's fun to throw rocks into the water. The bay is not very wide, and you can see the other side even on cloudy days.",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. My home is in a quiet neighborhood. Cars drive by on two state highways. It makes the street noisy, but it is generally quiet. Not many people move in or out of the neighborhood. I know most of the people who live here. We see each other often.\n\nPeople work in their yards and do other daily tasks. In the winter, we go sledding on a nearby hill. Our house is at the front of the street, so we see everyone who walks by. We notice new cars. Some neighbors go for walks or take their dogs for exercise. Children ride their bikes.\n\nWe work from home. There are four of us: my wife and two daughters, ages 11 and 14. We see the other neighbors every day. We like to play outside, even when it rains. Sometimes we grill on our back deck. The smell of barbecue is nice. We hear lawn mowers every day from March to October. We have many trees in the neighborhood. It is a wooded area. We have shade, but leaves fall in the fall. We have to rake and burn the leaves each year. \n\nWe don't have much winter. It feels like a long fall. Our garage is in the back of the house. We don't use the front door often. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects. When I open the garage doors, I feel connected to the neighborhood. Holidays are quiet. On Thanksgiving and other holidays, we see more cars and neighbors visit from other towns.\n\nI like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is in the middle of the desert. There is a lot of dirt here. If you have not lived here, you may not understand how it feels to see only brown everywhere. When I first lived here in the 1990s, houses were far apart. Now, there are more houses. The area is changing, like many places. Most people are friendly, but like any place, it has good and bad things. I live in a nice neighborhood. The people are old and friendly. The stores are mostly big chains, like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want healthy food, you have to go somewhere else. The main jobs in my city are in construction. The city is still not fully developed, so there is a lot of empty space to build. This worries me. I like things the way they are now. I moved from a big city and don't want to go back. \n\nMy job is in the construction field. I install drywall and T-bars. What I like about my home is the animals. People come to the desert for its beauty. The desert has hard environments that need protection. These areas are home to many kinds of animals. We should learn about the animals to live with them safely. My family and I have adapted to the wildlife. My children love lizards and bugs. They are outside now trying to catch them. We have some fun things to do here. Victorville is a good place for families to visit the desert. Visit us during the San Bernardino County Fair. It will be a fun experience. Go to Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons. If you want to learn about the desert's history and culture, visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has many interesting objects that tell the story of our area.",
            "I live in a special kind of neighborhood. It is the college campus where I study. My neighbors are the people who live in my dorm. I also think of the campus as my neighborhood, but to a smaller degree.\n\nMy neighborhood has some things that are like other neighborhoods. There are houses, people, stores and parks. Let's talk about the houses. There are three kinds of houses in my neighborhood. First, there are apartments. In these buildings, 2 to 4 people live in one room. There are 4 to 6 rooms on each floor. Each building has about 20 people.\n\nSecond, there are houses that people can rent. These houses have 2 to 4 bedrooms. But there are not many of these houses in my neighborhood. They are not as useful as the other kinds of houses.\n\nThird, there are dorm rooms. Many students live in these rooms. There are 2 people in each room, with a few exceptions.\n\nMy neighborhood is very diverse. People from different cultures and ages live here. The professional staff live in the houses, the new students live in the dorms, and the older students live in the apartments.\n\nLet's talk about the stores and parks in my neighborhood. My neighborhood is like a small town. It has many stores and one park. The stores have food, clothes and other things that people need. The park is a safe and clean place for everyone in my neighborhood to play.",
            "I have lived in this neighborhood for about ten years. When I first came here from Riverdale, I was very sad. I missed my old home and family. But my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a new place with a good school and a safe home.\n\nIt took me some time to get used to my new neighborhood. I made some new friends, but I also had enemies in school. I never really knew my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his children. They are kind people and I like them. I remember when Mr. Glen got married again. It was a happy time and I enjoyed it. I even caught a special piece of cloth that Ms. Veda threw, but I missed catching the flowers.\n\nThe neighborhood is like a maze, but now I have a GPS to help me navigate it. I like to explore and have found some nice places. I like to spend time with my friends Kason and Curtis. We play video games and have fun. I also like to go to the park and enjoy the nature. It makes me feel calm and peaceful.\n\nI also like to practice my balance with sticks and play with my wooden sword. There is a basketball and tennis court, but I don't play those sports much anymore. My dad taught me tennis with Mr. Graves when I was younger, and we had a lot of fun.\n\nI have had many good times in this neighborhood. I hope I will have many more.",
            "I live near my college. This is good. There are many apartment buildings. Some are nice, and some are not so nice. There are also restaurants and bars. They are not too expensive. I like to go to them. One bar changed its name. It is more expensive now, but the service is not bad. The people who live around me are friendly. They are mostly students or people with low incomes. They live in apartments because they are not too expensive. There is a school near my apartment. This is good because I see many children playing. I do not know my neighbors very well. They smoke a lot of marijuana. My building management put a air freshener near their door. This is funny. \n\nThe buildings around me are old, but some have been fixed inside. Down the street, there are new apartments. But I do not like them. They are cheaply made and expensive to rent. I think this is not fair. They are near the campus, so they can get away with it. There is a cheap restaurant near my home. They serve food on paper plates, and most of the food is microwave food. Across from this restaurant is a gas station. I have heard it is not a good place to work. But the city fixed the road last summer. Now there are nice sidewalks and a lot of grass. My apartment is near trees. Some of them were cut down, but there are still many trees. Behind my building is a line of trees and another apartment complex. I live on 42nd Street, but 43rd Street is not as nice. The sidewalks are bad, and the buildings look old. There are many trees to hide the old buildings. There is a lot of crime on 43rd Street. But I like where I live. It is affordable, and there are many good things nearby. I like that the university is close and there are two bus stops.",
            "My neighborhood is made up of houses on a round road with a dead end. The houses are close together and look like they are one house at a time. The only difference is each house is painted yellow and has a green metal roof. Almost all of the people in the neighborhood are friends with each other. We stand at the end of the road some evenings and talk. The small children play with toys, draw on the sidewalk with chalk, or fly kites. It is nice to live in this world that is full of machines and computers. It feels like we are stepping back in time. We are near fields and trees with a blue sky and white clouds. But sometimes we have bad weather. This year, we have had tornado warnings. Last night we heard the sirens and had to go to a safe place. I was in the bathtub with my small dog and some pillows. My big dog stayed in the living room and was very nervous. The neighborhood was quiet, except for the sound of big hail on the ground. After the storm, the road was hot and steaming. The hail melted when it hit the pavement. Then it started to rain and the sun came out. I saw a double rainbow and took a picture. The streets were quiet for a while, and then people came home from being elsewhere. Then it was normal again, with mothers and children outside while dinner cooked. I like this neighborhood. I moved here from another state and I like the way people talk. My apartment is like others in this neighborhood. But not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are small. I like to walk in the big field behind my house and go to the pond. I see deer and hear a big frog singing in the morning. It is a great place to live, near the city but not too close. Each morning I hear roosters crowing from the farms nearby. It feels like living in a small village. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that makes noise in the evening. I was lucky to find this nice neighborhood.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood when I was getting ready for eighth grade. It was hard to make friends at first, but I became close to two people who lived nearby. They are not there anymore, but happy memories remain. Many of the people who were here when I moved here are still living here today. My neighborhood is like many American suburbs. It has two-story houses. You often hear children playing outside on warm days or weekends. The neighborhood is usually quiet most days. I have never had a problem with my neighbors. You are left alone unless you need help. Packages I order online are always safe on my porch. I trust my neighbors.\n\nA park is near my house. I have good memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with my friends. But I also had a bad memory there when I was hit in the nose playing football. Good memories are more important. Now, I visit the park to spend time with my younger cousins. They enjoy playing on swings and slides. The park makes me happy and sad at the same time because of the good memories.\n\nMy neighborhood is different. You can find many kinds of food nearby. Within one mile, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. But many people now use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get food delivered. There are also many fast food shops. We have good pizza places too. The stores have everything you need. There are dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store. We even have an Indian store if you want to make Indian food. I am happy in my neighborhood. When I see bad news on social media, I am grateful for my good neighbors.",
            "I live in a small town in South Carolina. It is a special place. Many people grow food here. Johnston is famous for its peaches. You can see the town's sign when you enter. Most of Johnston is farmland. There are many peach trees and cows.\n\nHouses are not close together. Some are two stories high. They have metal roofs to keep cool in the hot summer. Others have gray roofs. Most houses are far from the road. This makes room for animals and food.\n\nIn the middle of town, there is one traffic light. It is at a four-way stop. There are a few stores here. You can get Chinese food at a restaurant called Hong Kong. They are a family business. There is also a Mexican restaurant called Fiesta. Another place is Gary's, a small burger shop. A long time ago, there was a pizza place, but it closed.\n\nThere is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They are famous for a special kind of soda called Cherry Coca-Cola. There is a small store called IGA where you can buy food. But many people go to a bigger store in the next town to buy most of their food.\n\nThe most popular store is called Dollar General. It sells many things. It is busy every day. There is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. A kind woman runs it. She has been here a long time. She can deliver the furniture to your house.\n\nNear the furniture store is a place that takes care of pets. They give baths, cut nails, and more. There are two small doctors and a vet in the town. They help people and animals who need it.\n\nThere is a small school for young children. When they get older, they go to school in the next town. There is no park in Johnston. But the town is building a new place for people to play.\n\nIt is a quiet town. There are not many things to do. But it is a nice place to live. You can drive through quickly and not even know you are there.",
            "The first time I heard about my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who were missing. It was surprising. Many apartments in the area cost over one thousand dollars a month. I had never heard this story before, and neither had my friends. Maybe it's because people are struggling. I know some of my friends cry at night because things are expensive. But we have learned to be careful with money. We like second-hand things, like toys from the flea market and old clothes. As you get older, you don't smell as much. You might start smoking or get used to things being a certain way. The flea market is always there. It has a strong smell, like old magazines on a piano. This smell stays even after you clean it. My neighborhood has three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start on one side, you can visit two charity stores, a library, a store with rare books, and a store with unusual things. The main area is busy, with cars and people. But inside the thrift stores, it is quiet. It's a good place to spend an afternoon. Every year, more and more cars and people come to the area. It is growing, they say. One of the biggest online companies has its headquarters here. It is still growing, and there are problems. It reminds me of New York. People are busy with their own goals, and they don't ask much from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. This is different from the South, where people care about each other. You can keep your private life here, and the city will keep moving like the ocean. It's a lively place to live. There's always something going on, like the piano player next door or the singers upstairs. We have a community, not just a group of strangers. We help each other when we need it, celebrate birthdays, and mourn when someone dies. I'm lucky to live here. I like most of my neighbors, and they are kind to me. We take care of each other and share things. It's nice to see them, and I think they like my company.",
            "I live in a neighborhood that is like many others in the suburbs. My area has a homeowner's association. This means that the lawns and houses look very similar. The houses are all single family homes and have a small patch of grass, some rocks, and a short driveway. Some houses have one story and some have two. You will not find any big holes in the road because they are well-maintained. The mailboxes are not in front of each house. Instead, there is a big group of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone needs a key to get their mail.\n\nMy house is on the edge of the city. This means we have a lot of space. We have a big pool and a walking trail. You can walk your dog or take a walk by yourself. The neighborhood is safe and people take care of each other. There are some older people, some middle-aged people, and some young people who live here.\n\nThe city is big and has many things to do. It has a small mall where you can buy food and other things. It takes 15 minutes to drive to the mall, but it has many stores. You can buy food or things you need. We have good stores with many things or small stores with few things and low prices.\n\nMy neighborhood is safe and nice. We have good things like pools and walking trails. We can easily drive to the mall to buy what we need.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest. My town is near a big city. I live in the east part of town, an area with lower property values. People mostly rent or own homes here because they are low-income. But this area is not ugly or unpleasant. My neighbors are friendly and say hello when I walk by. They are good people. Crime rates are a little higher here than in other parts of town. But they are still low. There have been some violent crimes, like shootings, near my home in the past ten years. One of my next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting last year. My family has not been hurt by crime, except maybe losing some things from our porch. The town where I live has a big problem - the opioid epidemic. Many people have died from overdoses. But the town has help for people with addiction. There are centers to help people get well and training to help families and friends. \n\nDespite the problems, my town is a good place to live. My son's elementary school has excellent teachers and staff. He has special needs, but he is safe and happy there. The school has a good atmosphere. The PTO does many fun events to get families involved. The school gives free breakfast and lunch to all students, so no child goes hungry. Everyone is treated equally, no matter how much money they have. The town has worked to make our town look nice, but most of the work has been on the other side of town. I like living here. People are kind, the schools are great, and we have enough stores to buy what we need. Our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable. We have lived here for 16 years and do not want to move.",
            "My neighborhood is special. It is on a hill with old buildings. I live in a 7-story apartment building near a historic theater. There is a bar at the bottom of the hill. People go there on warm summer nights. On weekends in June and July, there is often a long line. The neighborhood has a big park. It is surrounded by concrete walls with stairs. During the cold winter, homeless people put up tents near the park. They set them up close together to stay warm. They are near a place where people can get clean and eat.\n\nI like my neighborhood. It is not just the old buildings that I like. The people are special too. This neighborhood used to be a bad place. There was a lot of violence. But the people work hard to keep it clean. They care about their neighborhood.\n\nSome people say it is not safe for white people to walk around the hill at night. I think this is because of old ideas about different groups of people. My neighborhood is a place where people are kind to each other. They help me when I need it. I feel safe walking around the neighborhood at night.\n\nI have seen people give me money and tell me I am special. They see me as one of them, not as a stranger. I have sat on a bench and been given a jacket when it was cold. This is a place where people are kind and care about each other.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan. It is a beautiful place with many lakes. My town is close to two big lakes: Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. People can go to the beach and swim in these lakes. My neighborhood is like many other small towns. The houses are not very tall and are not all the same. Most homes are old and have basements. Some houses have aluminum siding and many have yards with trampolines and playsets. People take care of their houses and lawns. They are very clean and nice. Everyone knows each other in my neighborhood. You will see children playing in the streets. You will also see people walking dogs and biking. The town is quiet and safe. People work hard to make a living and raise their families. There is a police station and a jail not too far from my home. We also have a county health center and a recycling center. There are baseball and softball fields where you can hear the announcers calling the game. Our small town airport is close to my house. You can hear the planes taking off and landing. I can walk to get ice cream and my children can ride their bikes to the park, which is only a few blocks away. This is a great place to live."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

It is like many others here. The houses seem like they belong to a time long ago. People wanted to live in the suburbs. It seemed like a good idea, but now it is not as popular. My neighborhood still shows that the dream is alive. People still live here. They still take care of their yards, but not as well as before. There are still cars in the driveway. Children play outside. A public school has been here for almost 90 years. It still helps young people think about the future. It also makes older people remember the past. There are few churches, but the basketball courts are always full. All the houses look different, but feel the same. There is a big store called \"A\". It is owned by an Arab family. Most residents are African American. The streets are wide and children play football. They stop playing when cars come. Many people have lived here for a long time. They can tell stories about the past when everyone knew each other. There was a karate school, but it closed. Now it is a pharmacy. There is also a small movie theater that shows old films. It is cheap and popular with older people. There is a highway that goes through our town, but not in our town. There used to be a plan for a highway in our town, but it did not happen. Some people wanted it, but others did not. They thought it would ruin the town. Now, we are building a new high school. We need to choose a symbol for our town. I think a robot with a country accent and a cabin would be a good choice.",
            "You might not notice it at first. It is a residential area behind a shopping strip. People may not think there are places to live there. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods, you will find a community. Behind the hotels, you will see a group of apartment buildings. They are like Russian dolls, one next to the other, down the road.\n\nThe first apartments are not good places to live. The news talked about them. We do not talk much about them. But the other buildings are different. They are a nice place that few people know about.\n\nAcross the street is a community college. It is a quiet place where students go to learn. They come in one by one through iron gates. Commuters are not happy when they slow down traffic.\n\nThe road joins another street with a park and a place to help people who are hurt. The park is nice. Children play there. Old people walk their dogs. They see teenagers on skateboards and young girls talking about boys.\n\nThere is a sushi place, a store to buy swimming supplies, and a nail salon in a strip mall. You can buy food, fill your pool, and get a manicure all in one place. There is also a place to buy frozen yogurt. Teenagers often eat there and ride their skateboards.\n\nThis is a normal neighborhood in America. It is a part of history. Nothing much changes here, not even time.",
            "We drove past many corn fields. \"Where are we?\" she asked. \"This is my home,\" I said. She was surprised by the open space. She was from a town with a grocery store near her house. She had never seen so much open land before.\n\nI explained that I grew up in a small town in Ohio. It was different from her home. As we drove down a narrow road, we came to a big hole in the ground that had water in it. After that, we came to the small place where I live. The houses are made of brick and stucco. Each house has a big piece of land that everyone takes care of. In the spring, many flowers and big trees bloom. The driveways are full of nice cars that shine in the sun after they are washed. My neighbor is always outside. He mows his lawn and sings while he works. He is a kind person with a special history. He used to be a doctor. Now he is older and sometimes forgets things. He blends in with the grass and his lawn mower.\n\nWe kept driving and came to my house. There are many geese in the yard that my Terrier chases. There is a small stream in the back that flows into the big hole in the ground. You can hear many sounds: the stream, the bullfrogs, and the cows from the farms nearby. Across a small bridge made of wood is a special place filled with trees, herbs, and wildflowers. I spent most of my childhood there. I built forts and chased animals. I had many friends in the neighborhood. The winters in my town can be very cold. But they are also beautiful. The trees look bare and the yard is empty. Sometimes it snows and everything looks like a winter wonderland. My sister and I made snow angels and snowmen. We fought a lot when we were kids, but in the winter, we made up with snowballs. We built big forts to store our snowballs. That was our special place where we played and forgot about our problems.",
            "Portland, Oregon, is a city that loves to be called \"weird\". You will see this word on the side of a building that serves as a place to eat pizza, drink, and watch music. For some people, this means Portland is a reminder of the past, a time when the city was not well-known and was more affordable. Others see it as a call to visit, a place where people will still say you are weird, but in a nice way. Even though many people from California have moved here and new buildings are being built, Portland is still a weird city. \"Weird\" means accepting things that others do not accept. It does not mean we do not have modern things. We buy many things from China like everyone else. There are many ways to be weird, but Portland has normal things too. We have yoga, hipsters, and business people. Maybe being weird just means we do not take things too seriously. In my neighborhood, there are colorful houses with gardens and free boxes in the summer. Free boxes are old boxes with things people no longer want. But you can find great things in them, like clothes and books. The magic of walking through my neighborhood is what I love about Portland. However, I am just one kind of weird person among many. Some people I live with might not pick up things from the sidewalk. They go to special yoga with goats or watch the city soccer team. Portland is full of people who like many things. We are a city of people who chase our dreams or think about chasing them while we drink too much at the bar. Yes, Portland has a problem with drugs. Many of these problems start with mental health issues. The rainy weather and gray skies might be part of the problem. We also have a problem with homelessness. We have good social services, but they are not enough. The people without homes are drawn to our services, but the people with homes are divided. Some of them care and some of them hate. We are not weird in this.",
            "The mountains are always there. They are in the north. They see the sun's journey every day. They are not affected by my busy life. \n\nWhen I am stressed, I look at them. They help me feel better. They give me strength to keep going. I first saw these mountains when I was in college. They are near the campus. They are more beautiful than the university's buildings and ponds. \n\nThe rest of the town is also nice. There are many cafés where I study for a long time. I can walk or take a bus to the downtown area. There, the old buildings remind me of the past. This town is a mix of calm and busy places. It is a good place to live.\n\nI have happy and sad memories here. I like to walk in the park with my friends. I also like to go to the movie theater. But sometimes I feel sad and go to the pond. I see turtles and ducks living their lives. I think about my own life and my purpose. I walk to the main street and see the mountains. They are always there, big and strong. They make me feel strong too.",
            "If you plan to visit Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, do not worry. Getting there is easy. Public transportation is good and many people use it. Bensonhurst is a busy area in New York City. You will see many Asian stores and restaurants. This is because many Asian people have moved to Bensonhurst in the last 20 years. You will see a store like this on almost every block. Most people like these stores because they are cheap and sell good food. I live here and I see four Asian stores within a short walk from my home. This makes it easy to get what I need. But Bensonhurst is not just Asian. It is a mix of many different people. Some of the big stores are owned by Asian people. Also, there is a park near my home. It has basketball courts, a big field for soccer or baseball, and swings for kids. People from many different countries come to play here and get along well. There are not many big office buildings in Bensonhurst. Most people live in apartments or two-family houses. The people here are generally nice, but it can be noisy. You may hear loud music from cars or people driving fast. If you visit at night, be careful. This area is safe, but some people may cause trouble. I was bullied here a long time ago, but this does not happen much. However, there are package thieves in the area. Also, people do not always pick up after their dogs. You may see dog waste on the street. Be careful and try to keep your shoes clean.",
            "I live in a place where there are not many sidewalks. My house is at the top of a big hill in the neighborhood. People call it a \"workout hill\" because runners like to exercise there. There is no sidewalk on my street, so people walk on the road. The road is in bad shape in some places, and it can be dangerous to drive. The telephone and electric wires are old and broken in some areas.\n\nIt rains a lot in our area, and often branches fall on the power lines. The repairs make them look old and patchwork. There are many tall evergreen trees around. Some people do not like the trees because they block the view of the ocean. That's why many houses are built high up on the hill. They have big windows on the top floor to see the bay.\n\nThe view of the ocean is nice at sunset. The water looks beautiful when the sun shines on it. But most days are cloudy and damp. Moss grows on everything, including houses, cars, and fences. I once left my car in the driveway for a month. When I came back, it was covered in moss. It took me a long time to clean it.\n\nMost people in my neighborhood are old and retired. There are few children. Instead of kids, people have dogs. Dogs often run around in the neighborhood and sometimes enter homes through open doors or windows. I once found a dog in my living room and had to chase it out.\n\nRabbits are also common in our area. They dig up plants and burrow into lawns. My cats like to hunt them. We also see many birds, including small sparrows, hummingbirds, and sometimes hawks or eagles. But the crows can chase them away.\n\nThere are no stores near my house, but if you walk down to the waterfront, there are some restaurants that serve fresh seafood. The beach is not very big, but it's fun to throw rocks into the water. The bay is not very wide, and you can see the other side even on cloudy days.",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. My home is in a quiet neighborhood. Cars drive by on two state highways. It makes the street noisy, but it is generally quiet. Not many people move in or out of the neighborhood. I know most of the people who live here. We see each other often.\n\nPeople work in their yards and do other daily tasks. In the winter, we go sledding on a nearby hill. Our house is at the front of the street, so we see everyone who walks by. We notice new cars. Some neighbors go for walks or take their dogs for exercise. Children ride their bikes.\n\nWe work from home. There are four of us: my wife and two daughters, ages 11 and 14. We see the other neighbors every day. We like to play outside, even when it rains. Sometimes we grill on our back deck. The smell of barbecue is nice. We hear lawn mowers every day from March to October. We have many trees in the neighborhood. It is a wooded area. We have shade, but leaves fall in the fall. We have to rake and burn the leaves each year. \n\nWe don't have much winter. It feels like a long fall. Our garage is in the back of the house. We don't use the front door often. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects. When I open the garage doors, I feel connected to the neighborhood. Holidays are quiet. On Thanksgiving and other holidays, we see more cars and neighbors visit from other towns.\n\nI like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is in the middle of the desert. There is a lot of dirt here. If you have not lived here, you may not understand how it feels to see only brown everywhere. When I first lived here in the 1990s, houses were far apart. Now, there are more houses. The area is changing, like many places. Most people are friendly, but like any place, it has good and bad things. I live in a nice neighborhood. The people are old and friendly. The stores are mostly big chains, like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want healthy food, you have to go somewhere else. The main jobs in my city are in construction. The city is still not fully developed, so there is a lot of empty space to build. This worries me. I like things the way they are now. I moved from a big city and don't want to go back. \n\nMy job is in the construction field. I install drywall and T-bars. What I like about my home is the animals. People come to the desert for its beauty. The desert has hard environments that need protection. These areas are home to many kinds of animals. We should learn about the animals to live with them safely. My family and I have adapted to the wildlife. My children love lizards and bugs. They are outside now trying to catch them. We have some fun things to do here. Victorville is a good place for families to visit the desert. Visit us during the San Bernardino County Fair. It will be a fun experience. Go to Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons. If you want to learn about the desert's history and culture, visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has many interesting objects that tell the story of our area.",
            "I live in a special kind of neighborhood. It is the college campus where I study. My neighbors are the people who live in my dorm. I also think of the campus as my neighborhood, but to a smaller degree.\n\nMy neighborhood has some things that are like other neighborhoods. There are houses, people, stores and parks. Let's talk about the houses. There are three kinds of houses in my neighborhood. First, there are apartments. In these buildings, 2 to 4 people live in one room. There are 4 to 6 rooms on each floor. Each building has about 20 people.\n\nSecond, there are houses that people can rent. These houses have 2 to 4 bedrooms. But there are not many of these houses in my neighborhood. They are not as useful as the other kinds of houses.\n\nThird, there are dorm rooms. Many students live in these rooms. There are 2 people in each room, with a few exceptions.\n\nMy neighborhood is very diverse. People from different cultures and ages live here. The professional staff live in the houses, the new students live in the dorms, and the older students live in the apartments.\n\nLet's talk about the stores and parks in my neighborhood. My neighborhood is like a small town. It has many stores and one park. The stores have food, clothes and other things that people need. The park is a safe and clean place for everyone in my neighborhood to play.",
            "I have lived in this neighborhood for about ten years. When I first came here from Riverdale, I was very sad. I missed my old home and family. But my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a new place with a good school and a safe home.\n\nIt took me some time to get used to my new neighborhood. I made some new friends, but I also had enemies in school. I never really knew my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his children. They are kind people and I like them. I remember when Mr. Glen got married again. It was a happy time and I enjoyed it. I even caught a special piece of cloth that Ms. Veda threw, but I missed catching the flowers.\n\nThe neighborhood is like a maze, but now I have a GPS to help me navigate it. I like to explore and have found some nice places. I like to spend time with my friends Kason and Curtis. We play video games and have fun. I also like to go to the park and enjoy the nature. It makes me feel calm and peaceful.\n\nI also like to practice my balance with sticks and play with my wooden sword. There is a basketball and tennis court, but I don't play those sports much anymore. My dad taught me tennis with Mr. Graves when I was younger, and we had a lot of fun.\n\nI have had many good times in this neighborhood. I hope I will have many more.",
            "I live near my college. This is good. There are many apartment buildings. Some are nice, and some are not so nice. There are also restaurants and bars. They are not too expensive. I like to go to them. One bar changed its name. It is more expensive now, but the service is not bad. The people who live around me are friendly. They are mostly students or people with low incomes. They live in apartments because they are not too expensive. There is a school near my apartment. This is good because I see many children playing. I do not know my neighbors very well. They smoke a lot of marijuana. My building management put a air freshener near their door. This is funny. \n\nThe buildings around me are old, but some have been fixed inside. Down the street, there are new apartments. But I do not like them. They are cheaply made and expensive to rent. I think this is not fair. They are near the campus, so they can get away with it. There is a cheap restaurant near my home. They serve food on paper plates, and most of the food is microwave food. Across from this restaurant is a gas station. I have heard it is not a good place to work. But the city fixed the road last summer. Now there are nice sidewalks and a lot of grass. My apartment is near trees. Some of them were cut down, but there are still many trees. Behind my building is a line of trees and another apartment complex. I live on 42nd Street, but 43rd Street is not as nice. The sidewalks are bad, and the buildings look old. There are many trees to hide the old buildings. There is a lot of crime on 43rd Street. But I like where I live. It is affordable, and there are many good things nearby. I like that the university is close and there are two bus stops.",
            "My neighborhood is made up of houses on a round road with a dead end. The houses are close together and look like they are one house at a time. The only difference is each house is painted yellow and has a green metal roof. Almost all of the people in the neighborhood are friends with each other. We stand at the end of the road some evenings and talk. The small children play with toys, draw on the sidewalk with chalk, or fly kites. It is nice to live in this world that is full of machines and computers. It feels like we are stepping back in time. We are near fields and trees with a blue sky and white clouds. But sometimes we have bad weather. This year, we have had tornado warnings. Last night we heard the sirens and had to go to a safe place. I was in the bathtub with my small dog and some pillows. My big dog stayed in the living room and was very nervous. The neighborhood was quiet, except for the sound of big hail on the ground. After the storm, the road was hot and steaming. The hail melted when it hit the pavement. Then it started to rain and the sun came out. I saw a double rainbow and took a picture. The streets were quiet for a while, and then people came home from being elsewhere. Then it was normal again, with mothers and children outside while dinner cooked. I like this neighborhood. I moved here from another state and I like the way people talk. My apartment is like others in this neighborhood. But not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are small. I like to walk in the big field behind my house and go to the pond. I see deer and hear a big frog singing in the morning. It is a great place to live, near the city but not too close. Each morning I hear roosters crowing from the farms nearby. It feels like living in a small village. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that makes noise in the evening. I was lucky to find this nice neighborhood.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood when I was getting ready for eighth grade. It was hard to make friends at first, but I became close to two people who lived nearby. They are not there anymore, but happy memories remain. Many of the people who were here when I moved here are still living here today. My neighborhood is like many American suburbs. It has two-story houses. You often hear children playing outside on warm days or weekends. The neighborhood is usually quiet most days. I have never had a problem with my neighbors. You are left alone unless you need help. Packages I order online are always safe on my porch. I trust my neighbors.\n\nA park is near my house. I have good memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with my friends. But I also had a bad memory there when I was hit in the nose playing football. Good memories are more important. Now, I visit the park to spend time with my younger cousins. They enjoy playing on swings and slides. The park makes me happy and sad at the same time because of the good memories.\n\nMy neighborhood is different. You can find many kinds of food nearby. Within one mile, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. But many people now use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get food delivered. There are also many fast food shops. We have good pizza places too. The stores have everything you need. There are dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store. We even have an Indian store if you want to make Indian food. I am happy in my neighborhood. When I see bad news on social media, I am grateful for my good neighbors.",
            "I live in a small town in South Carolina. It is a special place. Many people grow food here. Johnston is famous for its peaches. You can see the town's sign when you enter. Most of Johnston is farmland. There are many peach trees and cows.\n\nHouses are not close together. Some are two stories high. They have metal roofs to keep cool in the hot summer. Others have gray roofs. Most houses are far from the road. This makes room for animals and food.\n\nIn the middle of town, there is one traffic light. It is at a four-way stop. There are a few stores here. You can get Chinese food at a restaurant called Hong Kong. They are a family business. There is also a Mexican restaurant called Fiesta. Another place is Gary's, a small burger shop. A long time ago, there was a pizza place, but it closed.\n\nThere is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They are famous for a special kind of soda called Cherry Coca-Cola. There is a small store called IGA where you can buy food. But many people go to a bigger store in the next town to buy most of their food.\n\nThe most popular store is called Dollar General. It sells many things. It is busy every day. There is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. A kind woman runs it. She has been here a long time. She can deliver the furniture to your house.\n\nNear the furniture store is a place that takes care of pets. They give baths, cut nails, and more. There are two small doctors and a vet in the town. They help people and animals who need it.\n\nThere is a small school for young children. When they get older, they go to school in the next town. There is no park in Johnston. But the town is building a new place for people to play.\n\nIt is a quiet town. There are not many things to do. But it is a nice place to live. You can drive through quickly and not even know you are there.",
            "The first time I heard about my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who were missing. It was surprising. Many apartments in the area cost over one thousand dollars a month. I had never heard this story before, and neither had my friends. Maybe it's because people are struggling. I know some of my friends cry at night because things are expensive. But we have learned to be careful with money. We like second-hand things, like toys from the flea market and old clothes. As you get older, you don't smell as much. You might start smoking or get used to things being a certain way. The flea market is always there. It has a strong smell, like old magazines on a piano. This smell stays even after you clean it. My neighborhood has three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start on one side, you can visit two charity stores, a library, a store with rare books, and a store with unusual things. The main area is busy, with cars and people. But inside the thrift stores, it is quiet. It's a good place to spend an afternoon. Every year, more and more cars and people come to the area. It is growing, they say. One of the biggest online companies has its headquarters here. It is still growing, and there are problems. It reminds me of New York. People are busy with their own goals, and they don't ask much from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. This is different from the South, where people care about each other. You can keep your private life here, and the city will keep moving like the ocean. It's a lively place to live. There's always something going on, like the piano player next door or the singers upstairs. We have a community, not just a group of strangers. We help each other when we need it, celebrate birthdays, and mourn when someone dies. I'm lucky to live here. I like most of my neighbors, and they are kind to me. We take care of each other and share things. It's nice to see them, and I think they like my company.",
            "I live in a neighborhood that is like many others in the suburbs. My area has a homeowner's association. This means that the lawns and houses look very similar. The houses are all single family homes and have a small patch of grass, some rocks, and a short driveway. Some houses have one story and some have two. You will not find any big holes in the road because they are well-maintained. The mailboxes are not in front of each house. Instead, there is a big group of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone needs a key to get their mail.\n\nMy house is on the edge of the city. This means we have a lot of space. We have a big pool and a walking trail. You can walk your dog or take a walk by yourself. The neighborhood is safe and people take care of each other. There are some older people, some middle-aged people, and some young people who live here.\n\nThe city is big and has many things to do. It has a small mall where you can buy food and other things. It takes 15 minutes to drive to the mall, but it has many stores. You can buy food or things you need. We have good stores with many things or small stores with few things and low prices.\n\nMy neighborhood is safe and nice. We have good things like pools and walking trails. We can easily drive to the mall to buy what we need.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest. My town is near a big city. I live in the east part of town, an area with lower property values. People mostly rent or own homes here because they are low-income. But this area is not ugly or unpleasant. My neighbors are friendly and say hello when I walk by. They are good people. Crime rates are a little higher here than in other parts of town. But they are still low. There have been some violent crimes, like shootings, near my home in the past ten years. One of my next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting last year. My family has not been hurt by crime, except maybe losing some things from our porch. The town where I live has a big problem - the opioid epidemic. Many people have died from overdoses. But the town has help for people with addiction. There are centers to help people get well and training to help families and friends. \n\nDespite the problems, my town is a good place to live. My son's elementary school has excellent teachers and staff. He has special needs, but he is safe and happy there. The school has a good atmosphere. The PTO does many fun events to get families involved. The school gives free breakfast and lunch to all students, so no child goes hungry. Everyone is treated equally, no matter how much money they have. The town has worked to make our town look nice, but most of the work has been on the other side of town. I like living here. People are kind, the schools are great, and we have enough stores to buy what we need. Our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable. We have lived here for 16 years and do not want to move.",
            "My neighborhood is special. It is on a hill with old buildings. I live in a 7-story apartment building near a historic theater. There is a bar at the bottom of the hill. People go there on warm summer nights. On weekends in June and July, there is often a long line. The neighborhood has a big park. It is surrounded by concrete walls with stairs. During the cold winter, homeless people put up tents near the park. They set them up close together to stay warm. They are near a place where people can get clean and eat.\n\nI like my neighborhood. It is not just the old buildings that I like. The people are special too. This neighborhood used to be a bad place. There was a lot of violence. But the people work hard to keep it clean. They care about their neighborhood.\n\nSome people say it is not safe for white people to walk around the hill at night. I think this is because of old ideas about different groups of people. My neighborhood is a place where people are kind to each other. They help me when I need it. I feel safe walking around the neighborhood at night.\n\nI have seen people give me money and tell me I am special. They see me as one of them, not as a stranger. I have sat on a bench and been given a jacket when it was cold. This is a place where people are kind and care about each other.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan. It is a beautiful place with many lakes. My town is close to two big lakes: Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. People can go to the beach and swim in these lakes. My neighborhood is like many other small towns. The houses are not very tall and are not all the same. Most homes are old and have basements. Some houses have aluminum siding and many have yards with trampolines and playsets. People take care of their houses and lawns. They are very clean and nice. Everyone knows each other in my neighborhood. You will see children playing in the streets. You will also see people walking dogs and biking. The town is quiet and safe. People work hard to make a living and raise their families. There is a police station and a jail not too far from my home. We also have a county health center and a recycling center. There are baseball and softball fields where you can hear the announcers calling the game. Our small town airport is close to my house. You can hear the planes taking off and landing. I can walk to get ice cream and my children can ride their bikes to the park, which is only a few blocks away. This is a great place to live."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I live in a large city. My neighborhood is different. There are many kinds of people. Houses are not close together. Some are near stores. Stores are different kinds. Some are big and well-known. Others are small and special. Many people like to eat at new restaurants. There are also many stores to buy things. People like to walk to the stores.\n\nMy neighborhood is not quiet. There are many things to see and do. There are parks near my home. People take their children to these parks. I see many different kinds of people in my neighborhood. We have a neighborhood for people who are LGBTQ+. We also have a Jewish community and a community from the Soviet Union. Outside my neighborhood, there are many more people from different countries. We have areas for Koreans, Chinese people, Armenians, and many more.\n\nBut it is hard to get to these places. The city is very big, and it takes a long time to drive. Many people do not walk. It is difficult to find parking. The city is getting more crowded. Buildings are being built. Many people are moving to the city. This is making traffic worse.\n\nMy city is not all apartments. There are houses and small buildings. Some houses have many rooms. Others have just a few rooms. I do not know many of my neighbors. But it was not always this way. When I was a child, I played with my neighbors. We were all close in age.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most houses are single family homes. Some homes are divided into two parts, but still connected. My home has a small front yard and a small driveway on the left. It looks like many other homes here. They remind us of the past when living in the suburbs was a dream for Americans. But now, this dream is not as strong. My neighborhood and others still show that the dream is real. People visit and see that the dream is still alive. The people here are trying to keep it alive. The homes are not as well taken care of as before. But there are still cars in the driveways. Children play outside as if the world is their whole world. A public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands. It makes young people think about the future. It also makes older people happy because it reminds them of the past. There are few churches and they are often empty. But the basketball courts are still busy. All the houses look different, but feel the same. There is a big store called Super \"A\". It is owned by a Yemeni family. They are probably the only Arab family in the neighborhood. Most people in my neighborhood are African American. The streets are wide and children play football. They stop playing to let cars pass. Many people have lived here for a long time. They know everyone. There used to be a karate school. But when the movies about karate were not popular anymore, children stopped taking karate lessons. Now, the karate school is a pharmacy. There is also a small movie theater that shows old movies at a low price. Young people do not like it because it does not show new movies. But older people like it. They think it is a good way to spend the evening. There is a big road that goes through our town. The entrance and exit are in the town next to ours. Some people wanted to put an exit in our town. Young people liked the idea. But older people did not. They said it would hurt our town. They talked to the city council and they said no. We are building a new high school. We are trying to choose a name for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be a good name.",
            "You might think it is not a place people want to live. But it is. Behind a shopping strip, there is a small community. If you go behind the old, empty store and the hotels, you can find it. The hotels are only used sometimes. They are used for family reunions in the summer. \n\nYou will see apartment buildings. They are next to each other. They look like Russian dolls. The first building has bad news sometimes. We will not talk about that. The other buildings are nice. They are not well known by people who live here. \n\nAcross the street, there is a college. It is a small school. Students go there to learn. They drink coffee and wake up early. The gates open slowly. Commuters are not happy. They are late for work. The road splits into another road. There is a park on one side. There is a hospital for people with broken bones on the other side. The hospital has nice chairs and a fan. Children play in the park. They run and laugh. They are very happy. Old people walk their dogs. They see teenagers on skateboards and teenagers talking. They live in a small town. \n\nThere is a place to eat sushi. It is near the park. There is a store to buy swimming things. There is a place to get a manicure. You can fill your pool while you get a manicure. There is a place to get cold yogurt. Teenagers eat yogurt and do tricks on their skateboards. The neighborhood is a special place. It is a piece of America's history. It is a small town in the south. Nothing changes there. Not even time.",
            "She asked, \"Where is everything?\" as we drove past fields of corn that covered the ground as far as the eye could see. I said, \"This is it!\" knowing she would be surprised by the empty land. She was from a town where a store was just a five-minute walk from her home. She had never seen so much open space before.\n\nI told her about growing up in rural Ohio. She then understood where I was from. As we drove down a two-lane road, we passed a big hole filled with water, called a quarry. Behind it is a small place where I live. The houses are made of brick and stucco. Each house has a big yard, about half an acre. People are very proud of their yards. In the spring, flowers and trees change colors with the seasons.\n\nPeople drive luxury cars, like Mercedes Benz, around here. They shine in the sun after they are washed. As we walked to my house, a neighbor was outside, smiling. He spends his day mowing his lawn and singing. Everyone likes him. He used to be a doctor, but he is getting older. He still has a big personality.\n\nMy house is near the end of the road. In my yard, geese live. They run from my dog. Behind my house, there is a stream that feeds into the quarry. You can hear frogs, the stream, and cows from the nearby farms. Across a small bridge made of wood is a special place. It has trees, herbs, and wildflowers that grow naturally. I played there a lot as a child. I built forts and chased animals. I had friends to play with too.\n\nIn the winter, it can be very cold here. But it is also very beautiful. The green trees are bare and the flowers are gone. Sometimes it snows and a winter wonderland appears. My sister and I made snow angels and snowmen. We also made forts out of branches. We used them to fight with snowballs. We made our own little world where nothing else mattered.",
            "Portland, Oregon is a city known for being different. A building in the city has a sign that says \"Keep Portland Weird\". This means Portland is a place that values being unique. It is a place where people can be themselves, even if they are different from others. In the past, Portland was a less expensive city and had a strong sense of creativity. Today, many wealthy people from California move to Portland and the city is changing. However, Portland is still a weird city. Being weird in Portland does not mean it is a place without rules. It means the city accepts people who are different. Like other cities, Portland buys things from other countries. Portland is a city with both normal and unusual things. People in Portland practice yoga, like a new kind of yoga with goats. Others watch soccer games at the Timbers stadium. Everyone in Portland likes different things. Some people work hard to pursue their dreams, while others spend a lot of time at the bar. Portland has problems, like a drug problem and a homelessness problem. Many people who are homeless come to Portland because the city has good services. However, the services are not enough to solve the problem. Most people in the city want to help the homeless, but some people are angry. Portland is not weird on this issue. It is a normal problem that many cities face.",
            "The mountains are always there. They are in the north and watch the sun rise and set. They do not care if I forget about them or if I am busy. They do not change, even when I am stressed. They help me feel better when I am anxious. I first saw the mountains when I started college. They are north of the campus. The university is a nice place with buildings, ponds, and trees. But the mountains are special to me. The town is also nice. There are many cafés where I studied and drank coffee. I can walk or take a bus to the downtown area. It is old and has a nice feel. But it is also busy and noisy. I can leave the busy part and go back to the quiet town. This town is full of contrast. It is a mix of calm and busy. I have many happy memories in this town. I walked with friends in the park and went to the movies in a nice theater. I also have sad memories. Sometimes I go to the ponds and think about my life. I walk along the water and see animals living their lives. I think about my own life and what I want. I walk to the main street and see the sun shining. The mountains are in the north, big and strong. They make me feel strong too. They remind me to keep going.",
            "If you visit Bensonhurst in New York City, you will not have trouble finding it. Public transportation is good and easy to use. Bensonhurst is a busy area, but it still feels like New York City. You will see many Asian stores. Many people from Asia have moved here in the last 20 years. This is why you see many Asian-owned stores every few blocks. Popular stores include supermarkets and laundromats. People like these stores because food is good, prices are low, and it is convenient. I live nearby and have four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of my home. This makes it easy to get groceries.\n\nBensonhurst is not just for people from Asia. Many different kinds of people live here. This is a good place for people from other countries and their children. Many Asian-owned businesses are popular. There is also a new park nearby. It has basketball courts, a field for sports, handball courts, swings for kids, and a water fountain for kids in the summer. People from all over come to play and have fun.\n\nIn Bensonhurst, you will not find big corporate buildings. Most homes are small, two-family houses. People are generally nice, but some can be noisy. Every day, you hear cars with loud music and people speeding by. At night, you should be careful. While Bensonhurst is safe, some people can be troublemakers. I was bullied here a long time ago, but this was a while back. Recently, some people have stolen packages from homes. It is a good idea to be careful. Another problem is that people do not clean up after their dogs. Every morning, you will see dog waste on the street. This is my biggest problem with Bensonhurst. Be careful and keep your shoes clean.",
            "I live in a place with no sidewalks. The road is steep and goes downhill. My house is at the top of the hill. People call it the \"work out hill.\" Many runners like to run up the hill every day. But there are no sidewalks on my street, so everyone walks on the road. The road is in bad shape in some places and can be dangerous to drive on.\n\nThe telephone and electric wires are old and look bad. It rains a lot in my area, so branches break the wires often. The wires look broken and fixed many times. There are many tall trees around. But people here do not like the trees. They cut down as many trees as they can. The trees block the view of the ocean. That's why many houses are built high up on the hill. They have big windows to see the ocean. It looks beautiful when the sun sets. The water looks like it's on fire and the sky turns orange.\n\nBut it's often cloudy and damp. Moss grows on everything: houses, cars, and fences. I left my car outside for a month and when I went to use it, it was covered in green moss. It took me a long time to clean it off. There are not many children in my neighborhood. A school is a few blocks away, but most people here are older. They are retired. Many people have dogs. They run around the neighborhood or sit in people's yards. If you leave a door or window open, the dogs might get in. I once found a dog in my living room and had to chase it out.\n\nThere are wild rabbits in the area. They dig up plants and make holes in people's lawns. My cats like the rabbits and have chased them out of our neighborhood. We see birds, like small sparrows and hummingbirds. Sometimes a hawk or eagle flies by, but the crows scare it away. There are no stores near my house. But if you walk downhill to the water, you can find some restaurants that serve fresh fish. There's no big beach, but you can throw rocks into the water. The water is not very wide. You can see the other side of the bay even when it's foggy.",
            "I live in a suburb in a small town in Tennessee. It is between two big roads. This causes some traffic on our street. But it is a quiet neighborhood. People do not move in and out often. I know most of my neighbors. They take care of their yards and do their daily work. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our street. Our house is at the front of the street, so we see many people passing by every day. We know the cars that the neighbors drive. We see strange cars and take note of them. Some neighbors walk for exercise or to take their dogs for a walk. Children play on their bikes. We are at home a lot because we work from home. There are four of us: I, my wife, and our two daughters, 11 and 14 years old. So, the neighbors are used to us coming and going. We like to play outside and sometimes go outside even when it rains. We also like to grill on our back deck. The smell of barbecue is nice. Many people cut their grass every day from March to October. Our neighborhood has many trees, so it is cool and shady. But it also means we have to rake and burn leaves in the fall. I like the smell of burning leaves. Lately, it has not been very cold in the winter, so it feels like a long fall. We use the back door of our house, which is near our garage. I like to work on my truck in the garage. When the garage doors are open, I feel connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, it is quiet around here. But on holidays like Thanksgiving, some families visit their relatives from other places and there are more cars on the street. I like living here. If it were not a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is in the middle of the desert. It is very dry here. If you have not lived here, you may not understand the feeling of seeing brown everywhere. When I first lived here in the 1990s, there were few houses. Now there are more houses. My neighborhood is getting more crowded. It looks like a city. But this is happening in many places. Most people are friendly, but every place has both good and bad things.\n\nI live near many old people. They are friendly. The stores in my area are chain stores like Food for Less and Smart and Final. If I want to buy food that is good for me, I have to go somewhere else. My town has many construction jobs. This is because the town is still growing. There is still a lot of empty space. I am afraid of this. I do not want to see too much change. I left a big city and do not want to go back.\n\nMy job is in construction. I install drywall and nails. I like living here because of the animals. Many people come to the desert because it is so beautiful. The desert is hard to live in, but it is also home to many animals. We should learn about these animals so we can live with them. My family and I like living here. My children like catching lizards and other desert bugs.\n\nWe have some attractions in my town. Victorville is a good place for families to visit. We have an annual fair that is fun. If you visit during the fair, you will have a good time. You can also visit Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and learn how to ski. If you are interested in the desert, you can visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has many interesting things to see, including rocks and old things that tell us about the desert.",
            "I live in a special kind of neighborhood. It is not like other neighborhoods where people own their own homes. My neighborhood is a college campus. I share a room with other students in a dormitory. We have a community of people from many different countries and ages. \n\nMy neighborhood has houses, people, stores, and a park. I want to talk about the houses first. There are three kinds of houses on the campus. Some are apartments with several rooms on each floor. They have 2-4 people living in each room. There are about 20 people in each building. Then, there are houses for rent for people connected to the school. These houses have 2-4 bedrooms. But there are not many of them. Most students live in dormitory rooms. They share a room with one other person, but sometimes there is only one person in the room.\n\nMy neighborhood is very diverse. People from many countries and ages live here. The staff live in houses, and the newer students live in dorms. The older students live in apartments. There are many stores in my neighborhood. You can find food, clothes, and other things you need. We also have a park. It is a safe place for everyone to play. The people in my neighborhood take care of the park to keep it clean and safe.",
            "I have lived in my neighborhood for about 10 years. When I first moved here from Riverdale to Stockbridge, I was very sad. I missed my old home and the people there. My mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a new neighborhood. They thought it would be better for us.\n\nOver time, I got used to my new home. I made some good friends and some not-so-good friends. I did not get to know my neighbors very well, except for Mr. Glen and his children. They are kind and nice people, like family to me. I have good memories of them.\n\nI remember Mr. Glen's wedding. It was fun! I was happy to be there with my family. I caught one of the wedding straps, but I missed the flowers. We all danced and had a good time. I was happy to be with my friends.\n\nMy neighborhood is like a maze. However, I have a GPS now, so I can explore more. I like to visit the park and enjoy nature. It makes me feel calm and peaceful. I also like to practice balance with sticks and play with my wooden sword. There is a basketball and tennis court, but I do not play as much as I used to.\n\nI grew up playing tennis with my dad and my friend. We had a good time, but it was hard work. Now, I have many happy memories of my neighborhood. I am excited to see what the future holds.",
            "I live near the college I attend. I like living there. The area has many apartment buildings, some restaurants and bars. I can walk to these places. One bar changed its name, and it is more expensive. But the service and drinks are good. People in the area are friendly. They are mostly college students or low-income people because the apartments are cheap. There is a school near my home, so there are many children. I do not know my neighbors. They smoke a lot of marijuana. The management put an air freshener near their door. My boyfriend and I think this is funny. It is almost insulting.\n\nThe buildings around me are old, but they may be fixed inside. A little way down the street, there are new buildings. But I do not like them. They are poorly built, but the rent is expensive. I think this is unfair because they are near the university. The managers can charge high rent.\n\nThere is a cheap restaurant near me. They serve food on paper plates. Much of the food is heated in a microwave. Across from the restaurant is a gas station. I have heard it is a bad place to work. But the city fixed the road near me. Now there is a nice sidewalk and grass on the sides of the road. The area is a little nicer.\n\nMy apartment building has trees. Some of them were cut down, so there are stumps. But there are many more trees near my home than in other areas. Behind my building is a tree line and another apartment complex. I live on 42nd street. The street behind mine, 43rd street, is not as nice. The sidewalks are broken, and the buildings look old. There are many trees on this street, but they hide the old buildings. Most of the crime in my area happens in an apartment complex on 43rd street. But I do not blame them. There are other apartments that have problems and a lot of turnover.\n\nI like where I live. I can afford it, and there are many things nearby that I need. I especially like that the university is within walking distance, and there are two bus stops near my home.",
            "My neighborhood is a group of houses on a small street with no end. The houses are close together and look like they are separate. They are painted yellow with white porches and green roofs. Almost everyone in the neighborhood is friends with each other. We stand at the end of the street and talk some evenings. Small children play outside with toys, chalk, or kites. It is nice in a world with many machines and computers. It is like living in the past.\n\nWe are surrounded by fields and trees with blue skies and white clouds. But our neighborhood has problems. We had a warning about a big storm with strong winds. One night, we heard a loud siren. We went to a safe place. My little dog and I hid in the bathtub with a purse and pillows. My big dog stayed in the living room and barked.\n\nThe storm was loud and the wind was strong. It was hard to walk outside. The road was hot and the hail was everywhere. Then the sun came out and it started to rain. I saw a beautiful rainbow in the sky. I took a picture with my camera to show my friends.\n\nAfter the storm, people stayed inside for a while. Then, they went back to their normal routine. Children played outside and moms cooked dinner. I like my neighborhood. I moved here from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I like the way people talk here. My apartment has two bedrooms and two bathrooms, just like all the other houses. But inside, they are different. Some are small. I like to walk in the big field behind my house and go to a small pond. I see deer and hear a big frog singing in the morning. It is a great place to live, near the city of Charlotte. Each morning, I hear roosters crowing from the farms nearby. It is like living in a small village. We even have a donkey that brays in the evening.\n\nI was lucky to find this nice neighborhood.",
            "I moved to a new neighborhood when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard to make friends at first. But I became friends with a boy who lived two houses away from me. Another boy lived on my street too. They do not live here anymore, but I still have good memories. Most people who lived here when I first moved here are still here. My neighborhood is similar to other neighborhoods in America. There are many houses with two floors. Every weekend, I can hear kids playing outside when it is warm. My neighborhood is usually quiet. I have never had a problem with the people who live here. You are left alone unless you need help. I have ordered things online many times, and no one has taken my packages. I feel safe. My neighbors are trustworthy. There is a park close to my house. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with my friends. I had a bad accident there once when I got hit in the nose playing football. But I have many good memories there. Now, I go to the park with my cousin's kids. They are younger than me and like to play on swings and slides. Thinking about the park makes me happy and sad at the same time. My neighborhood is diverse. You can find many kinds of food near here. There are Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants within a short walk. People now often use apps to have food delivered. There are many fast food places near here. There are also many stores. You can find a dry cleaner, a pharmacy, and a grocery store. There is an Indian store if you want to make Indian food. I like my neighborhood. I am thankful for it. I see bad things on social media, but I feel lucky to have a good neighborhood.",
            "I live in a small town in South Carolina. It is not very different from other towns. But it is very important for the agriculture industry. Johnston is called the Peach Capital of the World. This is written on a big sign that says welcome to the town. Many farms are in the town. Some farms have peach trees and some have cattle. Most houses are two stories high and have metal roofs or gray shingles to keep cool in the hot summer. These houses are not usually close to the road. They are often far away from the road so people can use the land for animals and crops. In the main part of town, there is a small traffic light. This is where you can find the only stores in the town. There are three places to eat fast food. One is a Chinese restaurant called Hong Kong. Another is a Mexican restaurant called Fiesta. The third is a small burger place called Gary's. There used to be a pizza place, but it closed. There is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They are famous for selling Cherry Coca-Cola. There is one small grocery store. It is called IGA. Many people go to a big store called Walmart in a nearby town to buy most of their food. The most popular store in town is Dollar General. It sells many things that people need every day. This store is always busy. There is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. A kind woman runs this store. She has been in business for a long time. She has two men who will help bring the furniture to your house. Next to the furniture store is a pet groomer called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They take care of pets and give them baths and trim their nails. There are two small doctor's offices and a small animal hospital in the town. They are not very big, but they can help the people who live in Johnston. There is one elementary school in the town. When children finish the fifth grade, they go to school in the next town. There is no park in the town, but the people are making a new park. This park will be 2.5 acres big. It will have places for people to play and visit. There are not many things to do in the town. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or places for children to play. But it is still a nice town. It is so small that you can miss it easily.",
            "I first heard about my area on a podcast about people who were missing.  It was a little surprising. Almost all the apartments there cost over one thousand dollars a month. I had never heard this story before, and my friends had not either. Life can be hard, and we have learned to save money. Some of my friends cry at night because things are expensive. But we make do. We like the smell of old toys and clothes that are not used. In adulthood, you smell less. You might start smoking or get used to things the way they are. But the flea market always comes back. The smell of being grown up is dusty magazines on a piano. It stays even after you clean it.\n\nThere are three thrift stores close to my home. If you start on one side, you can visit two stores that help people, a library, a store with old books, and a store with strange things. The neighborhood is busy, with cars and people everywhere. But inside the stores, it is quiet. You can be alone and not be bothered. It's a nice place to spend an afternoon. Every year, more and more people come here. It's a growing city. One of the biggest companies in the world is based here. It's still growing and has problems. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is busy with their own things, and nobody asks much about you. You can be alone and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where people care if you are worried about something. You can keep to yourself and the city will go on. It's a lively place to be. There is music next door and singing upstairs. We have a community instead of just apartment-mates. We help each other when we need it. We celebrate birthdays and funerals together. I'm lucky to be here. My neighbors are nice and we help each other.\n\nI live in a big, modern building, but my neighbors make me feel like I'm not alone. We take care of each other.",
            "I live in a typical suburb. My neighborhood is part of a community with a homeowner's association. This means we have rules to keep everything looking nice. Our houses are all the same. They are single-family homes with nice front yards. There is a small piece of grass, decorations, and a short driveway. Many houses have two cars. The roads are in good condition. We do not have mailboxes in front of our houses. Instead, we have a group of mailboxes at the end of the street. We use a key to get our mail.\n\nMy house is near the end of the city. We have a lot of space. We have community pools and walking trails. It is safe and well-maintained. Many people in the community are retired. We also have some middle-aged and young professionals. The city is big, but it feels small. We have many stores. We have a mall with not many stores, but it is enough. It takes me 15 minutes to drive to any big store. They have high-end stores for good food and cheap stores with few items. All in all, my neighborhood is safe and nice. We have good things like pools and trails. It is easy to get to big stores by driving.",
            "I live in a small town in the middle of the country. This town is near a big city. My neighborhood is on the east side. It is an area with low income levels. Many people in my neighborhood rent homes or own them. The homes are not very valuable. However, it is not an unattractive area. My neighbors are friendly people. They say hello when I walk down the street.\n\nCrime rates are a little higher in my neighborhood than in other parts of town. But they are still low. There have been some violent crimes near my home in the last ten years. These crimes include shootings and one death. Our neighbors lost their son in a shooting last year. I am lucky my family has not been affected by crime, except sometimes things go missing from our porch.\n\nMy town has a big problem. It is called the \"opioid epidemic.\" Many people in the country have this problem. Some people in my town have died from overdoses. But there are people who help people with this problem. They have places to get help and trainings for families and friends.\n\nDespite the problems, my town has good things. My son's school is excellent. The principal, teachers, and helpers are very good. My son is happy there. He has special needs, but he is not treated unfairly. The school is a nice place. They have events to help families and students learn. The school gives free food to all students. No one has to go hungry. We have a group that makes sure everyone can afford school things. The city government has made some improvements to our town. But most of these improvements are in the center of town and on the west side. This makes some people in my neighborhood unhappy.\n\nI like living in this town. The people are friendly, the schools are good, and there are many stores to buy things. My home is not very valuable, but it is comfortable. I have lived here for 16 years. I do not want to live anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It is on a hill and has old buildings with history. I live in a 7-story apartment building near an old theater. Across the street is a cool bar where people go on warm summer nights. People from all over come to this bar. On weekends in June and July, there is often a long line to get in.\n\nNearby is a big park. It is nice for the area. The park is surrounded by concrete with stairs. In the cold winter, homeless people put up tents in a safe place near the park. This makes them warmer. They are near a center where they can get a shower and a place to rest.\n\nI love my city. It is not just the old buildings that are nice. I love the people. My neighborhood has a bad history. Many years ago, it was a place with much violence. The government and police came to try to clean it up. The people remember this. They work hard to keep their neighborhood clean.\n\nPeople still warn others not to walk around at night. They say it is not safe. But I think this is because of old ideas and fear. I think the people in my neighborhood are kind. They help each other. I have been in need, and they have helped me. They are a community.\n\nI feel safe walking around at night. People are friendly and kind. In this neighborhood, you can be yourself and feel valued. I feel alive here. The people care about each other. I will always consider this place my home.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan. It is a rural area with farmland and small cities. There are no big shopping centers or stores like Wal-mart or Applebee's. If I need something, I must drive to get it. But I live near two big lakes, Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. They are beautiful and fun to visit. Many beaches are near my home where I can swim and play.\n\nMy neighborhood is a small town. The houses are not close together. They are old homes with big yards. Some houses are being fixed up and others are still old. Most houses have a basement that you can see from the road. The houses are different colors and have different kinds of yards. Some yards have big trampolines and playsets for kids. Other yards have gardens and fences for animals.\n\nThe people who live here are hard working and like to take care of their lawns. They keep the grass cut and the plants trimmed. The neighborhood is quiet and peaceful. It is a safe place to live. The police station and a jail are near my home. There is also a place to recycle and a baseball field where kids can play. Sometimes I can hear small planes flying nearby. There is a small airport near the baseball field. I can walk to get ice cream and to the park where my kids like to play. It is a great place to live."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I live in a large city. My neighborhood is different. There are many kinds of people. Houses are not close together. Some are near stores. Stores are different kinds. Some are big and well-known. Others are small and special. Many people like to eat at new restaurants. There are also many stores to buy things. People like to walk to the stores.\n\nMy neighborhood is not quiet. There are many things to see and do. There are parks near my home. People take their children to these parks. I see many different kinds of people in my neighborhood. We have a neighborhood for people who are LGBTQ+. We also have a Jewish community and a community from the Soviet Union. Outside my neighborhood, there are many more people from different countries. We have areas for Koreans, Chinese people, Armenians, and many more.\n\nBut it is hard to get to these places. The city is very big, and it takes a long time to drive. Many people do not walk. It is difficult to find parking. The city is getting more crowded. Buildings are being built. Many people are moving to the city. This is making traffic worse.\n\nMy city is not all apartments. There are houses and small buildings. Some houses have many rooms. Others have just a few rooms. I do not know many of my neighbors. But it was not always this way. When I was a child, I played with my neighbors. We were all close in age.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most houses are single family homes. Some homes are divided into two parts, but still connected. My home has a small front yard and a small driveway on the left. It looks like many other homes here. They remind us of the past when living in the suburbs was a dream for Americans. But now, this dream is not as strong. My neighborhood and others still show that the dream is real. People visit and see that the dream is still alive. The people here are trying to keep it alive. The homes are not as well taken care of as before. But there are still cars in the driveways. Children play outside as if the world is their whole world. A public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands. It makes young people think about the future. It also makes older people happy because it reminds them of the past. There are few churches and they are often empty. But the basketball courts are still busy. All the houses look different, but feel the same. There is a big store called Super \"A\". It is owned by a Yemeni family. They are probably the only Arab family in the neighborhood. Most people in my neighborhood are African American. The streets are wide and children play football. They stop playing to let cars pass. Many people have lived here for a long time. They know everyone. There used to be a karate school. But when the movies about karate were not popular anymore, children stopped taking karate lessons. Now, the karate school is a pharmacy. There is also a small movie theater that shows old movies at a low price. Young people do not like it because it does not show new movies. But older people like it. They think it is a good way to spend the evening. There is a big road that goes through our town. The entrance and exit are in the town next to ours. Some people wanted to put an exit in our town. Young people liked the idea. But older people did not. They said it would hurt our town. They talked to the city council and they said no. We are building a new high school. We are trying to choose a name for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be a good name.",
            "You might think it is not a place people want to live. But it is. Behind a shopping strip, there is a small community. If you go behind the old, empty store and the hotels, you can find it. The hotels are only used sometimes. They are used for family reunions in the summer. \n\nYou will see apartment buildings. They are next to each other. They look like Russian dolls. The first building has bad news sometimes. We will not talk about that. The other buildings are nice. They are not well known by people who live here. \n\nAcross the street, there is a college. It is a small school. Students go there to learn. They drink coffee and wake up early. The gates open slowly. Commuters are not happy. They are late for work. The road splits into another road. There is a park on one side. There is a hospital for people with broken bones on the other side. The hospital has nice chairs and a fan. Children play in the park. They run and laugh. They are very happy. Old people walk their dogs. They see teenagers on skateboards and teenagers talking. They live in a small town. \n\nThere is a place to eat sushi. It is near the park. There is a store to buy swimming things. There is a place to get a manicure. You can fill your pool while you get a manicure. There is a place to get cold yogurt. Teenagers eat yogurt and do tricks on their skateboards. The neighborhood is a special place. It is a piece of America's history. It is a small town in the south. Nothing changes there. Not even time.",
            "She asked, \"Where is everything?\" as we drove past fields of corn that covered the ground as far as the eye could see. I said, \"This is it!\" knowing she would be surprised by the empty land. She was from a town where a store was just a five-minute walk from her home. She had never seen so much open space before.\n\nI told her about growing up in rural Ohio. She then understood where I was from. As we drove down a two-lane road, we passed a big hole filled with water, called a quarry. Behind it is a small place where I live. The houses are made of brick and stucco. Each house has a big yard, about half an acre. People are very proud of their yards. In the spring, flowers and trees change colors with the seasons.\n\nPeople drive luxury cars, like Mercedes Benz, around here. They shine in the sun after they are washed. As we walked to my house, a neighbor was outside, smiling. He spends his day mowing his lawn and singing. Everyone likes him. He used to be a doctor, but he is getting older. He still has a big personality.\n\nMy house is near the end of the road. In my yard, geese live. They run from my dog. Behind my house, there is a stream that feeds into the quarry. You can hear frogs, the stream, and cows from the nearby farms. Across a small bridge made of wood is a special place. It has trees, herbs, and wildflowers that grow naturally. I played there a lot as a child. I built forts and chased animals. I had friends to play with too.\n\nIn the winter, it can be very cold here. But it is also very beautiful. The green trees are bare and the flowers are gone. Sometimes it snows and a winter wonderland appears. My sister and I made snow angels and snowmen. We also made forts out of branches. We used them to fight with snowballs. We made our own little world where nothing else mattered.",
            "Portland, Oregon is a city known for being different. A building in the city has a sign that says \"Keep Portland Weird\". This means Portland is a place that values being unique. It is a place where people can be themselves, even if they are different from others. In the past, Portland was a less expensive city and had a strong sense of creativity. Today, many wealthy people from California move to Portland and the city is changing. However, Portland is still a weird city. Being weird in Portland does not mean it is a place without rules. It means the city accepts people who are different. Like other cities, Portland buys things from other countries. Portland is a city with both normal and unusual things. People in Portland practice yoga, like a new kind of yoga with goats. Others watch soccer games at the Timbers stadium. Everyone in Portland likes different things. Some people work hard to pursue their dreams, while others spend a lot of time at the bar. Portland has problems, like a drug problem and a homelessness problem. Many people who are homeless come to Portland because the city has good services. However, the services are not enough to solve the problem. Most people in the city want to help the homeless, but some people are angry. Portland is not weird on this issue. It is a normal problem that many cities face.",
            "The mountains are always there. They are in the north and watch the sun rise and set. They do not care if I forget about them or if I am busy. They do not change, even when I am stressed. They help me feel better when I am anxious. I first saw the mountains when I started college. They are north of the campus. The university is a nice place with buildings, ponds, and trees. But the mountains are special to me. The town is also nice. There are many cafés where I studied and drank coffee. I can walk or take a bus to the downtown area. It is old and has a nice feel. But it is also busy and noisy. I can leave the busy part and go back to the quiet town. This town is full of contrast. It is a mix of calm and busy. I have many happy memories in this town. I walked with friends in the park and went to the movies in a nice theater. I also have sad memories. Sometimes I go to the ponds and think about my life. I walk along the water and see animals living their lives. I think about my own life and what I want. I walk to the main street and see the sun shining. The mountains are in the north, big and strong. They make me feel strong too. They remind me to keep going.",
            "If you visit Bensonhurst in New York City, you will not have trouble finding it. Public transportation is good and easy to use. Bensonhurst is a busy area, but it still feels like New York City. You will see many Asian stores. Many people from Asia have moved here in the last 20 years. This is why you see many Asian-owned stores every few blocks. Popular stores include supermarkets and laundromats. People like these stores because food is good, prices are low, and it is convenient. I live nearby and have four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of my home. This makes it easy to get groceries.\n\nBensonhurst is not just for people from Asia. Many different kinds of people live here. This is a good place for people from other countries and their children. Many Asian-owned businesses are popular. There is also a new park nearby. It has basketball courts, a field for sports, handball courts, swings for kids, and a water fountain for kids in the summer. People from all over come to play and have fun.\n\nIn Bensonhurst, you will not find big corporate buildings. Most homes are small, two-family houses. People are generally nice, but some can be noisy. Every day, you hear cars with loud music and people speeding by. At night, you should be careful. While Bensonhurst is safe, some people can be troublemakers. I was bullied here a long time ago, but this was a while back. Recently, some people have stolen packages from homes. It is a good idea to be careful. Another problem is that people do not clean up after their dogs. Every morning, you will see dog waste on the street. This is my biggest problem with Bensonhurst. Be careful and keep your shoes clean.",
            "I live in a place with no sidewalks. The road is steep and goes downhill. My house is at the top of the hill. People call it the \"work out hill.\" Many runners like to run up the hill every day. But there are no sidewalks on my street, so everyone walks on the road. The road is in bad shape in some places and can be dangerous to drive on.\n\nThe telephone and electric wires are old and look bad. It rains a lot in my area, so branches break the wires often. The wires look broken and fixed many times. There are many tall trees around. But people here do not like the trees. They cut down as many trees as they can. The trees block the view of the ocean. That's why many houses are built high up on the hill. They have big windows to see the ocean. It looks beautiful when the sun sets. The water looks like it's on fire and the sky turns orange.\n\nBut it's often cloudy and damp. Moss grows on everything: houses, cars, and fences. I left my car outside for a month and when I went to use it, it was covered in green moss. It took me a long time to clean it off. There are not many children in my neighborhood. A school is a few blocks away, but most people here are older. They are retired. Many people have dogs. They run around the neighborhood or sit in people's yards. If you leave a door or window open, the dogs might get in. I once found a dog in my living room and had to chase it out.\n\nThere are wild rabbits in the area. They dig up plants and make holes in people's lawns. My cats like the rabbits and have chased them out of our neighborhood. We see birds, like small sparrows and hummingbirds. Sometimes a hawk or eagle flies by, but the crows scare it away. There are no stores near my house. But if you walk downhill to the water, you can find some restaurants that serve fresh fish. There's no big beach, but you can throw rocks into the water. The water is not very wide. You can see the other side of the bay even when it's foggy.",
            "I live in a suburb in a small town in Tennessee. It is between two big roads. This causes some traffic on our street. But it is a quiet neighborhood. People do not move in and out often. I know most of my neighbors. They take care of their yards and do their daily work. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our street. Our house is at the front of the street, so we see many people passing by every day. We know the cars that the neighbors drive. We see strange cars and take note of them. Some neighbors walk for exercise or to take their dogs for a walk. Children play on their bikes. We are at home a lot because we work from home. There are four of us: I, my wife, and our two daughters, 11 and 14 years old. So, the neighbors are used to us coming and going. We like to play outside and sometimes go outside even when it rains. We also like to grill on our back deck. The smell of barbecue is nice. Many people cut their grass every day from March to October. Our neighborhood has many trees, so it is cool and shady. But it also means we have to rake and burn leaves in the fall. I like the smell of burning leaves. Lately, it has not been very cold in the winter, so it feels like a long fall. We use the back door of our house, which is near our garage. I like to work on my truck in the garage. When the garage doors are open, I feel connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, it is quiet around here. But on holidays like Thanksgiving, some families visit their relatives from other places and there are more cars on the street. I like living here. If it were not a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is in the middle of the desert. It is very dry here. If you have not lived here, you may not understand the feeling of seeing brown everywhere. When I first lived here in the 1990s, there were few houses. Now there are more houses. My neighborhood is getting more crowded. It looks like a city. But this is happening in many places. Most people are friendly, but every place has both good and bad things.\n\nI live near many old people. They are friendly. The stores in my area are chain stores like Food for Less and Smart and Final. If I want to buy food that is good for me, I have to go somewhere else. My town has many construction jobs. This is because the town is still growing. There is still a lot of empty space. I am afraid of this. I do not want to see too much change. I left a big city and do not want to go back.\n\nMy job is in construction. I install drywall and nails. I like living here because of the animals. Many people come to the desert because it is so beautiful. The desert is hard to live in, but it is also home to many animals. We should learn about these animals so we can live with them. My family and I like living here. My children like catching lizards and other desert bugs.\n\nWe have some attractions in my town. Victorville is a good place for families to visit. We have an annual fair that is fun. If you visit during the fair, you will have a good time. You can also visit Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and learn how to ski. If you are interested in the desert, you can visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has many interesting things to see, including rocks and old things that tell us about the desert.",
            "I live in a special kind of neighborhood. It is not like other neighborhoods where people own their own homes. My neighborhood is a college campus. I share a room with other students in a dormitory. We have a community of people from many different countries and ages. \n\nMy neighborhood has houses, people, stores, and a park. I want to talk about the houses first. There are three kinds of houses on the campus. Some are apartments with several rooms on each floor. They have 2-4 people living in each room. There are about 20 people in each building. Then, there are houses for rent for people connected to the school. These houses have 2-4 bedrooms. But there are not many of them. Most students live in dormitory rooms. They share a room with one other person, but sometimes there is only one person in the room.\n\nMy neighborhood is very diverse. People from many countries and ages live here. The staff live in houses, and the newer students live in dorms. The older students live in apartments. There are many stores in my neighborhood. You can find food, clothes, and other things you need. We also have a park. It is a safe place for everyone to play. The people in my neighborhood take care of the park to keep it clean and safe.",
            "I have lived in my neighborhood for about 10 years. When I first moved here from Riverdale to Stockbridge, I was very sad. I missed my old home and the people there. My mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a new neighborhood. They thought it would be better for us.\n\nOver time, I got used to my new home. I made some good friends and some not-so-good friends. I did not get to know my neighbors very well, except for Mr. Glen and his children. They are kind and nice people, like family to me. I have good memories of them.\n\nI remember Mr. Glen's wedding. It was fun! I was happy to be there with my family. I caught one of the wedding straps, but I missed the flowers. We all danced and had a good time. I was happy to be with my friends.\n\nMy neighborhood is like a maze. However, I have a GPS now, so I can explore more. I like to visit the park and enjoy nature. It makes me feel calm and peaceful. I also like to practice balance with sticks and play with my wooden sword. There is a basketball and tennis court, but I do not play as much as I used to.\n\nI grew up playing tennis with my dad and my friend. We had a good time, but it was hard work. Now, I have many happy memories of my neighborhood. I am excited to see what the future holds.",
            "I live near the college I attend. I like living there. The area has many apartment buildings, some restaurants and bars. I can walk to these places. One bar changed its name, and it is more expensive. But the service and drinks are good. People in the area are friendly. They are mostly college students or low-income people because the apartments are cheap. There is a school near my home, so there are many children. I do not know my neighbors. They smoke a lot of marijuana. The management put an air freshener near their door. My boyfriend and I think this is funny. It is almost insulting.\n\nThe buildings around me are old, but they may be fixed inside. A little way down the street, there are new buildings. But I do not like them. They are poorly built, but the rent is expensive. I think this is unfair because they are near the university. The managers can charge high rent.\n\nThere is a cheap restaurant near me. They serve food on paper plates. Much of the food is heated in a microwave. Across from the restaurant is a gas station. I have heard it is a bad place to work. But the city fixed the road near me. Now there is a nice sidewalk and grass on the sides of the road. The area is a little nicer.\n\nMy apartment building has trees. Some of them were cut down, so there are stumps. But there are many more trees near my home than in other areas. Behind my building is a tree line and another apartment complex. I live on 42nd street. The street behind mine, 43rd street, is not as nice. The sidewalks are broken, and the buildings look old. There are many trees on this street, but they hide the old buildings. Most of the crime in my area happens in an apartment complex on 43rd street. But I do not blame them. There are other apartments that have problems and a lot of turnover.\n\nI like where I live. I can afford it, and there are many things nearby that I need. I especially like that the university is within walking distance, and there are two bus stops near my home.",
            "My neighborhood is a group of houses on a small street with no end. The houses are close together and look like they are separate. They are painted yellow with white porches and green roofs. Almost everyone in the neighborhood is friends with each other. We stand at the end of the street and talk some evenings. Small children play outside with toys, chalk, or kites. It is nice in a world with many machines and computers. It is like living in the past.\n\nWe are surrounded by fields and trees with blue skies and white clouds. But our neighborhood has problems. We had a warning about a big storm with strong winds. One night, we heard a loud siren. We went to a safe place. My little dog and I hid in the bathtub with a purse and pillows. My big dog stayed in the living room and barked.\n\nThe storm was loud and the wind was strong. It was hard to walk outside. The road was hot and the hail was everywhere. Then the sun came out and it started to rain. I saw a beautiful rainbow in the sky. I took a picture with my camera to show my friends.\n\nAfter the storm, people stayed inside for a while. Then, they went back to their normal routine. Children played outside and moms cooked dinner. I like my neighborhood. I moved here from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I like the way people talk here. My apartment has two bedrooms and two bathrooms, just like all the other houses. But inside, they are different. Some are small. I like to walk in the big field behind my house and go to a small pond. I see deer and hear a big frog singing in the morning. It is a great place to live, near the city of Charlotte. Each morning, I hear roosters crowing from the farms nearby. It is like living in a small village. We even have a donkey that brays in the evening.\n\nI was lucky to find this nice neighborhood.",
            "I moved to a new neighborhood when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard to make friends at first. But I became friends with a boy who lived two houses away from me. Another boy lived on my street too. They do not live here anymore, but I still have good memories. Most people who lived here when I first moved here are still here. My neighborhood is similar to other neighborhoods in America. There are many houses with two floors. Every weekend, I can hear kids playing outside when it is warm. My neighborhood is usually quiet. I have never had a problem with the people who live here. You are left alone unless you need help. I have ordered things online many times, and no one has taken my packages. I feel safe. My neighbors are trustworthy. There is a park close to my house. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with my friends. I had a bad accident there once when I got hit in the nose playing football. But I have many good memories there. Now, I go to the park with my cousin's kids. They are younger than me and like to play on swings and slides. Thinking about the park makes me happy and sad at the same time. My neighborhood is diverse. You can find many kinds of food near here. There are Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants within a short walk. People now often use apps to have food delivered. There are many fast food places near here. There are also many stores. You can find a dry cleaner, a pharmacy, and a grocery store. There is an Indian store if you want to make Indian food. I like my neighborhood. I am thankful for it. I see bad things on social media, but I feel lucky to have a good neighborhood.",
            "I live in a small town in South Carolina. It is not very different from other towns. But it is very important for the agriculture industry. Johnston is called the Peach Capital of the World. This is written on a big sign that says welcome to the town. Many farms are in the town. Some farms have peach trees and some have cattle. Most houses are two stories high and have metal roofs or gray shingles to keep cool in the hot summer. These houses are not usually close to the road. They are often far away from the road so people can use the land for animals and crops. In the main part of town, there is a small traffic light. This is where you can find the only stores in the town. There are three places to eat fast food. One is a Chinese restaurant called Hong Kong. Another is a Mexican restaurant called Fiesta. The third is a small burger place called Gary's. There used to be a pizza place, but it closed. There is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They are famous for selling Cherry Coca-Cola. There is one small grocery store. It is called IGA. Many people go to a big store called Walmart in a nearby town to buy most of their food. The most popular store in town is Dollar General. It sells many things that people need every day. This store is always busy. There is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. A kind woman runs this store. She has been in business for a long time. She has two men who will help bring the furniture to your house. Next to the furniture store is a pet groomer called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They take care of pets and give them baths and trim their nails. There are two small doctor's offices and a small animal hospital in the town. They are not very big, but they can help the people who live in Johnston. There is one elementary school in the town. When children finish the fifth grade, they go to school in the next town. There is no park in the town, but the people are making a new park. This park will be 2.5 acres big. It will have places for people to play and visit. There are not many things to do in the town. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or places for children to play. But it is still a nice town. It is so small that you can miss it easily.",
            "I first heard about my area on a podcast about people who were missing.  It was a little surprising. Almost all the apartments there cost over one thousand dollars a month. I had never heard this story before, and my friends had not either. Life can be hard, and we have learned to save money. Some of my friends cry at night because things are expensive. But we make do. We like the smell of old toys and clothes that are not used. In adulthood, you smell less. You might start smoking or get used to things the way they are. But the flea market always comes back. The smell of being grown up is dusty magazines on a piano. It stays even after you clean it.\n\nThere are three thrift stores close to my home. If you start on one side, you can visit two stores that help people, a library, a store with old books, and a store with strange things. The neighborhood is busy, with cars and people everywhere. But inside the stores, it is quiet. You can be alone and not be bothered. It's a nice place to spend an afternoon. Every year, more and more people come here. It's a growing city. One of the biggest companies in the world is based here. It's still growing and has problems. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is busy with their own things, and nobody asks much about you. You can be alone and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where people care if you are worried about something. You can keep to yourself and the city will go on. It's a lively place to be. There is music next door and singing upstairs. We have a community instead of just apartment-mates. We help each other when we need it. We celebrate birthdays and funerals together. I'm lucky to be here. My neighbors are nice and we help each other.\n\nI live in a big, modern building, but my neighbors make me feel like I'm not alone. We take care of each other.",
            "I live in a typical suburb. My neighborhood is part of a community with a homeowner's association. This means we have rules to keep everything looking nice. Our houses are all the same. They are single-family homes with nice front yards. There is a small piece of grass, decorations, and a short driveway. Many houses have two cars. The roads are in good condition. We do not have mailboxes in front of our houses. Instead, we have a group of mailboxes at the end of the street. We use a key to get our mail.\n\nMy house is near the end of the city. We have a lot of space. We have community pools and walking trails. It is safe and well-maintained. Many people in the community are retired. We also have some middle-aged and young professionals. The city is big, but it feels small. We have many stores. We have a mall with not many stores, but it is enough. It takes me 15 minutes to drive to any big store. They have high-end stores for good food and cheap stores with few items. All in all, my neighborhood is safe and nice. We have good things like pools and trails. It is easy to get to big stores by driving.",
            "I live in a small town in the middle of the country. This town is near a big city. My neighborhood is on the east side. It is an area with low income levels. Many people in my neighborhood rent homes or own them. The homes are not very valuable. However, it is not an unattractive area. My neighbors are friendly people. They say hello when I walk down the street.\n\nCrime rates are a little higher in my neighborhood than in other parts of town. But they are still low. There have been some violent crimes near my home in the last ten years. These crimes include shootings and one death. Our neighbors lost their son in a shooting last year. I am lucky my family has not been affected by crime, except sometimes things go missing from our porch.\n\nMy town has a big problem. It is called the \"opioid epidemic.\" Many people in the country have this problem. Some people in my town have died from overdoses. But there are people who help people with this problem. They have places to get help and trainings for families and friends.\n\nDespite the problems, my town has good things. My son's school is excellent. The principal, teachers, and helpers are very good. My son is happy there. He has special needs, but he is not treated unfairly. The school is a nice place. They have events to help families and students learn. The school gives free food to all students. No one has to go hungry. We have a group that makes sure everyone can afford school things. The city government has made some improvements to our town. But most of these improvements are in the center of town and on the west side. This makes some people in my neighborhood unhappy.\n\nI like living in this town. The people are friendly, the schools are good, and there are many stores to buy things. My home is not very valuable, but it is comfortable. I have lived here for 16 years. I do not want to live anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It is on a hill and has old buildings with history. I live in a 7-story apartment building near an old theater. Across the street is a cool bar where people go on warm summer nights. People from all over come to this bar. On weekends in June and July, there is often a long line to get in.\n\nNearby is a big park. It is nice for the area. The park is surrounded by concrete with stairs. In the cold winter, homeless people put up tents in a safe place near the park. This makes them warmer. They are near a center where they can get a shower and a place to rest.\n\nI love my city. It is not just the old buildings that are nice. I love the people. My neighborhood has a bad history. Many years ago, it was a place with much violence. The government and police came to try to clean it up. The people remember this. They work hard to keep their neighborhood clean.\n\nPeople still warn others not to walk around at night. They say it is not safe. But I think this is because of old ideas and fear. I think the people in my neighborhood are kind. They help each other. I have been in need, and they have helped me. They are a community.\n\nI feel safe walking around at night. People are friendly and kind. In this neighborhood, you can be yourself and feel valued. I feel alive here. The people care about each other. I will always consider this place my home.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan. It is a rural area with farmland and small cities. There are no big shopping centers or stores like Wal-mart or Applebee's. If I need something, I must drive to get it. But I live near two big lakes, Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. They are beautiful and fun to visit. Many beaches are near my home where I can swim and play.\n\nMy neighborhood is a small town. The houses are not close together. They are old homes with big yards. Some houses are being fixed up and others are still old. Most houses have a basement that you can see from the road. The houses are different colors and have different kinds of yards. Some yards have big trampolines and playsets for kids. Other yards have gardens and fences for animals.\n\nThe people who live here are hard working and like to take care of their lawns. They keep the grass cut and the plants trimmed. The neighborhood is quiet and peaceful. It is a safe place to live. The police station and a jail are near my home. There is also a place to recycle and a baseball field where kids can play. Sometimes I can hear small planes flying nearby. There is a small airport near the baseball field. I can walk to get ice cream and to the park where my kids like to play. It is a great place to live."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I live in a large city. My neighborhood is different. There are many kinds of people. Houses are not close together. Some are near stores. Stores are different kinds. Some are big and well-known. Others are small and special. Many people like to eat at new restaurants. There are also many stores to buy things. People like to walk to the stores.\n\nMy neighborhood is not quiet. There are many things to see and do. There are parks near my home. People take their children to these parks. I see many different kinds of people in my neighborhood. We have a neighborhood for people who are LGBTQ+. We also have a Jewish community and a community from the Soviet Union. Outside my neighborhood, there are many more people from different countries. We have areas for Koreans, Chinese people, Armenians, and many more.\n\nBut it is hard to get to these places. The city is very big, and it takes a long time to drive. Many people do not walk. It is difficult to find parking. The city is getting more crowded. Buildings are being built. Many people are moving to the city. This is making traffic worse.\n\nMy city is not all apartments. There are houses and small buildings. Some houses have many rooms. Others have just a few rooms. I do not know many of my neighbors. But it was not always this way. When I was a child, I played with my neighbors. We were all close in age.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most houses are single family homes. Some homes are divided into two parts, but still connected. My home has a small front yard and a small driveway on the left. It looks like many other homes here. They remind us of the past when living in the suburbs was a dream for Americans. But now, this dream is not as strong. My neighborhood and others still show that the dream is real. People visit and see that the dream is still alive. The people here are trying to keep it alive. The homes are not as well taken care of as before. But there are still cars in the driveways. Children play outside as if the world is their whole world. A public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands. It makes young people think about the future. It also makes older people happy because it reminds them of the past. There are few churches and they are often empty. But the basketball courts are still busy. All the houses look different, but feel the same. There is a big store called Super \"A\". It is owned by a Yemeni family. They are probably the only Arab family in the neighborhood. Most people in my neighborhood are African American. The streets are wide and children play football. They stop playing to let cars pass. Many people have lived here for a long time. They know everyone. There used to be a karate school. But when the movies about karate were not popular anymore, children stopped taking karate lessons. Now, the karate school is a pharmacy. There is also a small movie theater that shows old movies at a low price. Young people do not like it because it does not show new movies. But older people like it. They think it is a good way to spend the evening. There is a big road that goes through our town. The entrance and exit are in the town next to ours. Some people wanted to put an exit in our town. Young people liked the idea. But older people did not. They said it would hurt our town. They talked to the city council and they said no. We are building a new high school. We are trying to choose a name for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be a good name.",
            "You might think it is not a place people want to live. But it is. Behind a shopping strip, there is a small community. If you go behind the old, empty store and the hotels, you can find it. The hotels are only used sometimes. They are used for family reunions in the summer. \n\nYou will see apartment buildings. They are next to each other. They look like Russian dolls. The first building has bad news sometimes. We will not talk about that. The other buildings are nice. They are not well known by people who live here. \n\nAcross the street, there is a college. It is a small school. Students go there to learn. They drink coffee and wake up early. The gates open slowly. Commuters are not happy. They are late for work. The road splits into another road. There is a park on one side. There is a hospital for people with broken bones on the other side. The hospital has nice chairs and a fan. Children play in the park. They run and laugh. They are very happy. Old people walk their dogs. They see teenagers on skateboards and teenagers talking. They live in a small town. \n\nThere is a place to eat sushi. It is near the park. There is a store to buy swimming things. There is a place to get a manicure. You can fill your pool while you get a manicure. There is a place to get cold yogurt. Teenagers eat yogurt and do tricks on their skateboards. The neighborhood is a special place. It is a piece of America's history. It is a small town in the south. Nothing changes there.

She had never seen so much open space before.\n\nI told her about growing up in rural Ohio. She then understood where I was from. As we drove down a two-lane road, we passed a big hole filled with water, called a quarry. Behind it is a small place where I live. The houses are made of brick and stucco. Each house has a big yard, about half an acre. People are very proud of their yards. In the spring, flowers and trees change colors with the seasons.\n\nPeople drive luxury cars, like Mercedes Benz, around here. They shine in the sun after they are washed.

            "Portland, Oregon is a city known for being different. A building in the city has a sign that says \"Keep Portland Weird\". This means Portland is a place that values being unique. It is a place where people can be themselves, even if they are different from others. In the past, Portland was a less expensive city and had a strong sense of creativity. Today, many wealthy people from California move to Portland and the city is changing. However, Portland is still a weird city. Being weird in Portland does not mean it is a place without rules. It means the city accepts people who are different. Like other cities, Portland buys things from other countries. Portland is a city with both normal and unusual things. People in Portland practice yoga, like a new kind of yoga with goats. Others watch soccer games at the Timbers stadium. Everyone in Portland likes different things. Some people work hard to pursue their dreams, while others spend a lot of time at the bar. Portland has problems, like a drug problem and a homelessness problem. Many people who are homeless come to Portland because the city has good services. However, the services are not enough to solve the problem. Most people in the city want to help the homeless, but some people are angry. Portland is not weird on this issue. It is a normal problem that many cities face.",
            "The mountains are always there. They are in the north and watch the sun rise and set. They do not care if I forget about them or if I am busy. They do not change, even when I am stressed. They help me feel better when I am anxious. I first saw the mountains when I started college. They are north of the campus. The university is a nice place with buildings, ponds, and trees. But the mountains are special to me. The town is also nice. There are many cafés where I studied and drank coffee. I can walk or take a bus to the downtown area. It is old and has a nice feel. But it is also busy and noisy. I can leave the busy part and go back to the quiet town. This town is full of contrast. It is a mix of calm and busy. I have many happy memories in this town. I walked with friends in the park and went to the movies in a nice theater. I also have sad memories. Sometimes I go to the ponds and think about my life. I walk along the water and see animals living their lives. I think about my own life and what I want. I walk to the main street and see the sun shining. The mountains are in the north, big and strong. They make me feel strong too. They remind me to keep going.",
            "If you visit Bensonhurst in New York City, you will not have trouble finding it. Public transportation is good and easy to use. Bensonhurst is a busy area, but it still feels like New York City. You will see many Asian stores. Many people from Asia have moved here in the last 20 years. This is why you see many Asian-owned stores every few blocks. Popular stores include supermarkets and laundromats. People like these stores because food is good, prices are low, and it is convenient. I live nearby and have four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of my home. This makes it easy to get groceries.\n\nBensonhurst is not just for people from Asia. Many different kinds of people live here. This is a good place for people from other countries and their children. Many Asian-owned businesses are popular. There is also a new park nearby. It has basketball courts, a field for sports, handball courts, swings for kids, and a water fountain for kids in the summer. People from all over come to play and have fun.\n\nIn Bensonhurst, you will not find big corporate buildings. Most homes are small, two-family houses. People are generally nice, but some can be noisy. Every day, you hear cars with loud music and people speeding by. At night, you should be careful. While Bensonhurst is safe, some people can be troublemakers. I was bullied here a long time ago, but this was a while back. Recently, some people have stolen packages from homes. It is a good idea to be careful. Another problem is that people do not clean up after their dogs. Every morning, you will see dog waste on the street. This is my biggest problem with Bensonhurst. Be careful and keep your shoes clean.",
            "I live in a place with no sidewalks. The road is steep and goes downhill. My house is at the top of the hill. People call it the \"work out hill.\" Many runners like to run up the hill every day. But there are no sidewalks on my street, so everyone walks on the road. The road is in bad shape in some places and can be dangerous to drive on.\n\nThe telephone and electric wires are old and look bad. It rains a lot in my area, so branches break the wires often. The wires look broken and fixed many times. There are many tall trees around. But people here do not like the trees. They cut down as many trees as they can. The trees block the view of the ocean. That's why many houses are built high up on the hill. They have big windows to see the ocean. It looks beautiful when the sun sets. The water looks like it's on fire and the sky turns orange.\n\nBut it's often cloudy and damp. Moss grows on everything: houses, cars, and fences. I left my car outside for a month and when I went to use it, it was covered in green moss. It took me a long time to clean it off. There are not many children in my neighborhood. A school is a few blocks away, but most people here are older. They are retired. Many people have dogs. They run around the neighborhood or sit in people's yards. If you leave a door or window open, the dogs might get in. I once found a dog in my living room and had to chase it out.\n\nThere are wild rabbits in the area. They dig up plants and make holes in people's lawns. My cats like the rabbits and have chased them out of our neighborhood. We see birds, like small sparrows and hummingbirds. Sometimes a hawk or eagle flies by, but the crows scare it away. There are no stores near my house. But if you walk downhill to the water, you can find some restaurants that serve fresh fish. There's no big beach, but you can throw rocks into the water. The water is not very wide. You can see the other side of the bay even when it's foggy.",
            "I live in a suburb in a small town in Tennessee. It is between two big roads. This causes some traffic on our street. But it is a quiet neighborhood. People do not move in and out often. I know most of my neighbors. They take care of their yards and do their daily work. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our street. Our house is at the front of the street, so we see many people passing by every day. We know the cars that the neighbors drive. We see strange cars and take note of them. Some neighbors walk for exercise or to take their dogs for a walk. Children play on their bikes. We are at home a lot because we work from home. There are four of us: I, my wife, and our two daughters, 11 and 14 years old. So, the neighbors are used to us coming and going. We like to play outside and sometimes go outside even when it rains. We also like to grill on our back deck. The smell of barbecue is nice. Many people cut their grass every day from March to October. Our neighborhood has many trees, so it is cool and shady. But it also means we have to rake and burn leaves in the fall. I like the smell of burning leaves. Lately, it has not been very cold in the winter, so it feels like a long fall. We use the back door of our house, which is near our garage. I like to work on my truck in the garage. When the garage doors are open, I feel connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, it is quiet around here. But on holidays like Thanksgiving, some families visit their relatives from other places and there are more cars on the street. I like living here. If it were not a through street, it would be perfect.",

When I first lived here in the 1990s, there were few houses. Now there are more houses. My neighborhood is getting more crowded. It looks like a city. But this is happening in many places. Most people are friendly, but every place has both good and bad things.\n\nI live near many old people. They are friendly. The stores in my area are chain stores like Food for Less and Smart and Final. If I want to buy food that is good for me, I have to go somewhere else. My town has many construction jobs. This is because the town is still growing. There is still a lot of empty space. I am afraid of this. I do not want to see too much change. I left a big city and do not want to go back.\n\nMy job is in construction. I install drywall and nails. I like living here because of the animals. Many people come to the desert because it is so beautiful. The desert is hard to live in, but it is also home to many animals. We should learn about these animals so we can live with them. My family and I like living here. My children like catching lizards and other desert bugs.\n\nWe have some attractions in my town. Victorville is a good place for families to visit. We have an annual fair that is fun. If you visit during the fair, you will have a good time. You can also visit Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and learn how to ski. If you are interested in the desert, you can visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has many interesting things to see, including rocks and old things that tell us about the desert.",

I share a room with other students in a dormitory. We have a community of people from many different countries and ages. \n\nMy neighborhood has houses, people, stores, and a park. I want to talk about the houses first. There are three kinds of houses on the campus. Some are apartments with several rooms on each floor. They have 2-4 people living in each room. There are about 20 people in each building. Then, there are houses for rent for people connected to the school. These houses have 2-4 bedrooms. But there are not many of them. Most students live in dormitory rooms. They share a room with one other person, but sometimes there is only one person in the room.\n\nMy neighborhood is very diverse. People from many countries and ages live here. The staff live in houses, and the newer students live in dorms. The older students live in apartments. There are many stores in my neighborhood.

            "I have lived in my neighborhood for about 10 years. When I first moved here from Riverdale to Stockbridge, I was very sad. I missed my old home and the people there. My mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a new neighborhood. They thought it would be better for us.\n\nOver time, I got used to my new home. I made some good friends and some not-so-good friends. I did not get to know my neighbors very well, except for Mr. Glen and his children. They are kind and nice people, like family to me. I have good memories of them.\n\nI remember Mr. Glen's wedding. It was fun! I was happy to be there with my family. I caught one of the wedding straps, but I missed the flowers. We all danced and had a good time. I was happy to be with my friends.\n\nMy neighborhood is like a maze. However, I have a GPS now, so I can explore more. I like to visit the park and enjoy nature. It makes me feel calm and peaceful. I also like to practice balance with sticks and play with my wooden sword. There is a basketball and tennis court, but I do not play as much as I used to.\n\nI grew up playing tennis with my dad and my friend. We had a good time, but it was hard work. Now, I have many happy memories of my neighborhood. I am excited to see what the future holds.",
            "I live near the college I attend. I like living there. The area has many apartment buildings, some restaurants and bars. I can walk to these places. One bar changed its name, and it is more expensive. But the service and drinks are good. People in the area are friendly. They are mostly college students or low-income people because the apartments are cheap. There is a school near my home, so there are many children. I do not know my neighbors. They smoke a lot of marijuana. The management put an air freshener near their door. My boyfriend and I think this is funny. It is almost insulting.\n\nThe buildings around me are old, but they may be fixed inside. A little way down the street, there are new buildings. But I do not like them. They are poorly built, but the rent is expensive. I think this is unfair because they are near the university. The managers can charge high rent.\n\nThere is a cheap restaurant near me. They serve food on paper plates. Much of the food is heated in a microwave. Across from the restaurant is a gas station. I have heard it is a bad place to work. But the city fixed the road near me. Now there is a nice sidewalk and grass on the sides of the road. The area is a little nicer.\n\nMy apartment building has trees. Some of them were cut down, so there are stumps. But there are many more trees near my home than in other areas. Behind my building is a tree line and another apartment complex. I live on 42nd street. The street behind mine, 43rd street, is not as nice. The sidewalks are broken, and the buildings look old. There are many trees on this street, but they hide the old buildings. Most of the crime in my area happens in an apartment complex on 43rd street. But I do not blame them. There are other apartments that have problems and a lot of turnover.\n\nI like where I live. I can afford it, and there are many things nearby that I need. I especially like that the university is within walking distance, and there are two bus stops near my home.",
            "My neighborhood is a group of houses on a small street with no end. The houses are close together and look like they are separate. They are painted yellow with white porches and green roofs. Almost everyone in the neighborhood is friends with each other. We stand at the end of the street and talk some evenings. Small children play outside with toys, chalk, or kites. It is nice in a world with many machines and computers. It is like living in the past.\n\nWe are surrounded by fields and trees with blue skies and white clouds. But our neighborhood has problems. We had a warning about a big storm with strong winds. One night, we heard a loud siren. We went to a safe place. My little dog and I hid in the bathtub with a purse and pillows. My big dog stayed in the living room and barked.\n\nThe storm was loud and the wind was strong. It was hard to walk outside. The road was hot and the hail was everywhere. Then the sun came out and it started to rain. I saw a beautiful rainbow in the sky. I took a picture with my camera to show my friends.\n\nAfter the storm, people stayed inside for a while. Then, they went back to their normal routine. Children played outside and moms cooked dinner. I like my neighborhood. I moved here from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I like the way people talk here. My apartment has two bedrooms and two bathrooms, just like all the other houses. But inside, they are different. Some are small. I like to walk in the big field behind my house and go to a small pond. I see deer and hear a big frog singing in the morning. It is a great place to live, near the city of Charlotte. Each morning, I hear roosters crowing from the farms nearby. It is like living in a small village. We even have a donkey that brays in the evening.\n\nI was lucky to find this nice neighborhood.",
            "I moved to a new neighborhood when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard to make friends at first. But I became friends with a boy who lived two houses away from me. Another boy lived on my street too. They do not live here anymore, but I still have good memories. Most people who lived here when I first moved here are still here. My neighborhood is similar to other neighborhoods in America. There are many houses with two floors. Every weekend, I can hear kids playing outside when it is warm. My neighborhood is usually quiet. I have never had a problem with the people who live here. You are left alone unless you need help. I have ordered things online many times, and no one has taken my packages. I feel safe. My neighbors are trustworthy. There is a park close to my house. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with my friends. I had a bad accident there once when I got hit in the nose playing football. But I have many good memories there. Now, I go to the park with my cousin's kids. They are younger than me and like to play on swings and slides. Thinking about the park makes me happy and sad at the same time. My neighborhood is diverse. You can find many kinds of food near here. There are Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants within a short walk. People now often use apps to have food delivered. There are many fast food places near here. There are also many stores. You can find a dry cleaner, a pharmacy, and a grocery store. There is an Indian store if you want to make Indian food. I like my neighborhood. I am thankful for it. I see bad things on social media, but I feel lucky to have a good neighborhood.",
            "I live in a small town in South Carolina. It is not very different from other towns. But it is very important for the agriculture industry. Johnston is called the Peach Capital of the World. This is written on a big sign that says welcome to the town. Many farms are in the town. Some farms have peach trees and some have cattle. Most houses are two stories high and have metal roofs or gray shingles to keep cool in the hot summer. These houses are not usually close to the road. They are often far away from the road so people can use the land for animals and crops. In the main part of town, there is a small traffic light. This is where you can find the only stores in the town. There are three places to eat fast food. One is a Chinese restaurant called Hong Kong. Another is a Mexican restaurant called Fiesta. The third is a small burger place called Gary's. There used to be a pizza place, but it closed. There is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They are famous for selling Cherry Coca-Cola. There is one small grocery store. It is called IGA. Many people go to a big store called Walmart in a nearby town to buy most of their food. The most popular store in town is Dollar General. It sells many things that people need every day. This store is always busy. There is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. A kind woman runs this store. She has been in business for a long time. She has two men who will help bring the furniture to your house. Next to the furniture store is a pet groomer called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They take care of pets and give them baths and trim their nails. There are two small doctor's offices and a small animal hospital in the town. They are not very big, but they can help the people who live in Johnston. There is one elementary school in the town. When children finish the fifth grade, they go to school in the next town. There is no park in the town, but the people are making a new park. This park will be 2.5 acres big. It will have places for people to play and visit. There are not many things to do in the town. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or places for children to play. But it is still a nice town. It is so small that you can miss it easily.",
            "I first heard about my area on a podcast about people who were missing.  It was a little surprising. Almost all the apartments there cost over one thousand dollars a month. I had never heard this story before, and my friends had not either. Life can be hard, and we have learned to save money. Some of my friends cry at night because things are expensive. But we make do. We like the smell of old toys and clothes that are not used. In adulthood, you smell less. You might start smoking or get used to things the way they are. But the flea market always comes back. The smell of being grown up is dusty magazines on a piano. It stays even after you clean it.\n\nThere are three thrift stores close to my home. If you start on one side, you can visit two stores that help people, a library, a store with old books, and a store with strange things. The neighborhood is busy, with cars and people everywhere. But inside the stores, it is quiet. You can be alone and not be bothered. It's a nice place to spend an afternoon. Every year, more and more people come here. It's a growing city. One of the biggest companies in the world is based here. It's still growing and has problems. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is busy with their own things, and nobody asks much about you. You can be alone and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where people care if you are worried about something. You can keep to yourself and the city will go on. It's a lively place to be. There is music next door and singing upstairs. We have a community instead of just apartment-mates. We help each other when we need it. We celebrate birthdays and funerals together. I'm lucky to be here. My neighbors are nice and we help each other.\n\nI live in a big, modern building, but my neighbors make me feel like I'm not alone. We take care of each other.",
            "I live in a typical suburb. My neighborhood is part of a community with a homeowner's association. This means we have rules to keep everything looking nice. Our houses are all the same. They are single-family homes with nice front yards. There is a small piece of grass, decorations, and a short driveway. Many houses have two cars. The roads are in good condition. We do not have mailboxes in front of our houses. Instead, we have a group of mailboxes at the end of the street. We use a key to get our mail.\n\nMy house is near the end of the city. We have a lot of space. We have community pools and walking trails. It is safe and well-maintained. Many people in the community are retired. We also have some middle-aged and young professionals. The city is big, but it feels small. We have many stores. We have a mall with not many stores, but it is enough. It takes me 15 minutes to drive to any big store. They have high-end stores for good food and cheap stores with few items. All in all, my neighborhood is safe and nice. We have good things like pools and trails. It is easy to get to big stores by driving.",
            "I live in a small town in the middle of the country. This town is near a big city. My neighborhood is on the east side. It is an area with low income levels. Many people in my neighborhood rent homes or own them. The homes are not very valuable. However, it is not an unattractive area. My neighbors are friendly people. They say hello when I walk down the street.\n\nCrime rates are a little higher in my neighborhood than in other parts of town. But they are still low. There have been some violent crimes near my home in the last ten years. These crimes include shootings and one death. Our neighbors lost their son in a shooting last year. I am lucky my family has not been affected by crime, except sometimes things go missing from our porch.\n\nMy town has a big problem. It is called the \"opioid epidemic.\" Many people in the country have this problem. Some people in my town have died from overdoses. But there are people who help people with this problem. They have places to get help and trainings for families and friends.\n\nDespite the problems, my town has good things. My son's school is excellent. The principal, teachers, and helpers are very good. My son is happy there. He has special needs, but he is not treated unfairly. The school is a nice place. They have events to help families and students learn. The school gives free food to all students. No one has to go hungry. We have a group that makes sure everyone can afford school things. The city government has made some improvements to our town. But most of these improvements are in the center of town and on the west side. This makes some people in my neighborhood unhappy.\n\nI like living in this town. The people are friendly, the schools are good, and there are many stores to buy things. My home is not very valuable, but it is comfortable. I have lived here for 16 years. I do not want to live anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It is on a hill and has old buildings with history. I live in a 7-story apartment building near an old theater. Across the street is a cool bar where people go on warm summer nights. People from all over come to this bar. On weekends in June and July, there is often a long line to get in.\n\nNearby is a big park. It is nice for the area. The park is surrounded by concrete with stairs. In the cold winter, homeless people put up tents in a safe place near the park. This makes them warmer. They are near a center where they can get a shower and a place to rest.\n\nI love my city. It is not just the old buildings that are nice. I love the people. My neighborhood has a bad history. Many years ago, it was a place with much violence. The government and police came to try to clean it up. The people remember this. They work hard to keep their neighborhood clean.\n\nPeople still warn others not to walk around at night. They say it is not safe. But I think this is because of old ideas and fear. I think the people in my neighborhood are kind. They help each other. I have been in need, and they have helped me. They are a community.\n\nI feel safe walking around at night. People are friendly and kind. In this neighborhood, you can be yourself and feel valued. I feel alive here. The people care about each other. I will always consider this place my home.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan. It is a rural area with farmland and small cities. There are no big shopping centers or stores like Wal-mart or Applebee's. If I need something, I must drive to get it. But I live near two big lakes, Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. They are beautiful and fun to visit. Many beaches are near my home where I can swim and play.\n\nMy neighborhood is a small town. The houses are not close together. They are old homes with big yards. Some houses are being fixed up and others are still old. Most houses have a basement that you can see from the road. The houses are different colors and have different kinds of yards. Some yards have big trampolines and playsets for kids. Other yards have gardens and fences for animals.\n\nThe people who live here are hard working and like to take care of their lawns. They keep the grass cut and the plants trimmed. The neighborhood is quiet and peaceful. It is a safe place to live. The police station and a jail are near my home. There is also a place to recycle and a baseball field where kids can play. Sometimes I can hear small planes flying nearby. There is a small airport near the baseball field. I can walk to get ice cream and to the park where my kids like to play. It is a great place to live."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I live in a big city. My neighborhood is very different from others. Small houses are near big buildings. Some buildings are offices, others are stores, restaurants, and places to have fun. There are many new places to eat and shop. Some big companies own some of the stores. But many small stores are popular too. They are in big shopping centers or on streets that people can walk on. My neighborhood is close to parks. I see many people with children in these parks. My neighborhood is also very different because there are many kinds of people. We have a group of people who support the LGBTQ+ community, a Jewish community, and people from the former Soviet Union. There are many more people from different countries and races in other parts of the city. They often live in their own areas. For example, we have an area called Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia. But it can take a long time to get to these places because of traffic. Many people in my city do not walk. The city is very big, and it is hard to walk far. We have a lot of traffic problems. Sometimes it takes a long time to find a parking space. Recently, many new buildings have been built. But some people do not want more people to move in. They do not want more cars on the road. There are many kinds of houses in my city. Not everyone lives in big buildings. We have houses, small apartment buildings, and condominiums. Some houses are for one family, and some have two families. My neighborhood is the same. There are many kinds of houses and people of different ages. I do not know most of my neighbors. But when I was a child, I played with my next-door neighbor and some other friends.",

My home has a small yard in front and a small driveway to the side. It is like other homes here. They remind us of the past when living in the suburbs was a popular dream in America. But now, fewer people are happy about it. The yards are not as clean as they used to be. There are still cars in most driveways. Children play outside as if nothing is wrong. Our public school, which has been here for almost 90 years, still works. It makes young people think of the future. It also makes older people happy when they remember the past.

There used to be a karate school, but it closed because no one wanted to learn karate anymore. Now it is a pharmacy where people buy medicine. There is also a small movie theater that shows old movies at a low price. Children do not like it, but older people enjoy it. They think it is worth the cost for a night out. We have a highway that goes through our town. It starts and ends in the town next to ours. Some people wanted to fix it so it starts and ends here. But older people did not want the highway in our town. They said it would hurt our town. So, the city said no. We are building a new high school and choosing a symbol for our town.

Some people like this because it was like that long ago. They want to remember the old Portland, a city that was not well-known and was not expensive. This made it a place for creative and unique ideas. To others, it is a call to come and join them. Portland is still a weird place. It is not mean \"weird\" as in always accepting.

It is an urban area, but you can still feel like you are in a big city. Many Asian stores are there. Over the past 20 years, many Asian people have moved to Bensonhurt.

People call it the \"workout hill\" because many people run up it every day. Because there are no sidewalks on my street, everyone walks on the road. The road is not in good shape in some places, and it's not safe to drive on. The wires on my street are old and broken. The weather is rainy and stormy here, so the trees hit the wires often. The repairs make the wires look old and broken. There are many tall trees everywhere. But people do not like the trees. They try to cut down many of them. The trees block the view of the ocean. That's why many houses are built high up on the hill. They have big windows on the top floor to see the bay. It's nice to see the bay at sunset. The water shines and the sky turns orange. But it's often cloudy. Most days are gray and damp. Moss grows on everything. I left my car outside for a month, and it was covered in moss. It took three hours to clean it. There are not many children in my neighborhood. There is a school a few blocks away. Many people in my neighborhood are old and retired. They have dogs instead of children. You often see them in people's yards or running down the street. If you leave a door or window open, they can get into your house. I once found one in my living room. I had to chase it out. Rabbits are also a problem. They dig up plants and make holes in people's lawns. My cats like to hunt them. We also have birds like sparrows and hummingbirds. Sometimes a hawk or eagle comes, but the crows chase it away. There are no stores near my house. But if you walk down to the waterfront, there are some restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There is no beach, but you can throw rocks into the water. The bay is not very wide. You can see the other side even on cloudy days.",

My family and I work from home. There are four of us: my wife and our two daughters, ages 11 and 14. We are used to seeing each other come and go. We like to play outside, even in the rain. Sometimes we grill on our back deck. The smell of barbecue is nice. We have many trees in our neighborhood. The area was once a forest, so there is a lot of shade. But in the fall, there are many leaves, and we have to rake and burn them. The smell of burning leaves means fall is here. Lately, we have not had much winter. It feels like fall is long. Our garage is at the back of our house. We use the front door only when someone visits. I like to work in the garage and fix things. When the garage door is open, I feel connected to the neighborhood. Holidays are quiet here. On Thanksgiving, some families visit from out of town, and there are many extra cars. Other holidays, like Mother's Day and Christmas, are the same.\n\nI like living here. If the street were not a through street, it would be perfect.",

I like my neighborhood. There are old people who are nice. The stores are mostly big chains like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. There are no stores like Whole Foods. If you want to buy healthy food, you have to go somewhere else. Many people work in construction. This city is not very developed yet. There is still much empty space. I do not like this. I left a big city and do not want to go back. My job is in construction. I install drywall and T-bars. I like the animals here. People come to the desert for its beauty. It is hard to live here because of the animals. We must learn about them to live safely. My children like lizards and desert bugs. They are outside trying to catch them now. Victorville is a good place for families. It is a good experience. If you visit, go to the San Bernardino County Fair. It is an annual event. You can also go to Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and take winter sports lessons. If you like history and culture, visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has objects from the past that tell the story of Victorville's development.",
            "When I describe my neighborhood, it is different from others. I live on a college campus. My community is the people in my dormitory. The campus is also my neighborhood. It is not like a usual neighborhood, but it has some similar things. It has houses, people, stores, and a park.\n\nLet's start with the houses. My neighborhood has three types of houses. There are apartments, houses, and dormitories. The apartments usually have 2-4 people in each room. The dormitories are very common and have 100s of students. Each student shares a room with one other person.\n\nIn my neighborhood, there are people from many different cultures and ages. Many of the staff live in the houses. The newer students live in the dormitories, and the older students live in the apartments.\n\nNow, let's talk about the stores and park. The campus is a self-contained neighborhood, so it has many stores. These stores sell food, clothes, and other things you need. The park is a place for everyone in the neighborhood to play. The park is clean and safe because everyone helps keep it that way.",
            "I have lived in this neighborhood for about 10 years. When I first came here from Riverdale, I was sad. I missed my old home and friends. My mom and dad made us move because they wanted a better life for my sister and me. Here, we have a good house and a better school. Over time, I made new friends and enemies at school. I didn't know my neighbors very well, except Mr. Glen and his children. They are kind people and I consider them like family.\n\nI remember Mr. Glen's wedding. It was fun. I caught a special strap that Ms. Veda wore. I also met one of their daughters, Marsharii. I haven't seen her in a long time. I hope she is happy.\n\nThe neighborhood is like a maze. I use a GPS to help me get around. I have explored some of it with my friends Kason and Curtis. We like to play video games and have fun. I also like to go to the park and be near nature. It makes me feel calm. I take sticks and practice my balance. I also have a wooden sword and like to play with it.\n\nThere is a basketball and tennis court. I used to play tennis with my dad and his friend, Mr. Graves. We worked hard, but it was fun. I hope to play again soon. I have many good memories in this neighborhood, and I think the best is yet to come.",
            "I live in a neighborhood near my college. I enjoy living here because it is close to school. There are many apartment buildings, some restaurants and bars. I like going to these places because they are not very expensive. One bar changed its name, and it is a bit more expensive. However, it is not bad. Many people are friendly. They are mostly students or people who cannot afford to live in other places because the rent is low here.\n\nThere is a school near my apartment. This is why there are many children. I do not know my neighbors very well. They smoke a lot of marijuana. My landlord put a special machine in their apartment to remove bad smells. I think this is funny. My boyfriend and I found it strange.\n\nThe buildings around me are old, but they may have new inside. Some buildings across the street are brand new. But I do not like them. They are built poorly, and the rent is high. I think this is not fair. They are near the campus, so they can get away with it.\n\nI like a small restaurant near my home. It is cheap, and they serve food quickly. There is a gas station near it, but people do not like working there. The city fixed the road near my home last year, so it is nicer now. My apartment building has trees around it. The city cut down some trees, but there are still many.\n\nBehind my building is a line of trees and another apartment complex. I live on 42nd Street. The street behind mine is 43rd Street. It is not as nice. The sidewalks are broken, and the buildings look old. There are many trees here, but they hide the buildings. There is a lot of crime on 43rd Street. It is not just the one apartment complex, though. There are other apartments with problems too. I like where I live because it is affordable, and I have many things near me. The university is close, and there are two bus stops. I can easily go to the store or downtown.",
            "My neighborhood is special. It has many houses on a circle. These houses look like separate homes. The only difference is they are all painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Most people are friends with each other. We stand at the end of the road and talk in the evenings. Children play outside with toys and chalk. It is nice to be here in a world with many machines. It is like going backward in time.\n\nWe are near fields and trees. The sky is blue and white clouds are everywhere. But sometimes we have problems. This time of year, we have warnings about tornadoes. Recently, we heard sirens and had to seek shelter. I was in my bathtub with my little dog and a few pillows. My big dog stayed in the living room and barked. The neighborhood was quiet with only the sound of hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road was hot and steaming. We had a big temperature change. The hail melted quickly on the hot pavement. Then the sun came out and it started to rain. I saw a double rainbow. I quickly took pictures with my camera. My friends on Facebook were amazed, just like me.\n\nThe neighborhood was quiet for a while after the storm. Then people started coming home. They were cooking dinner. It is a friendly neighborhood. I like it here. I moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina a while back. I like the way people talk down here. I have a two-bedroom apartment, like most people. But not all apartments are the same inside. Some are small. I like to walk in the big field behind my house. I go to the pond, but it is not safe to swim. I see deer and hear a big frog in the morning. It is a great place to live, near the city of Charlotte. Each morning, I hear roosters. It is like living in a small village. We have a donkey at a nearby farm who brays in the evening. I was lucky to find this neighborhood.",
            "I moved to my new neighborhood when I was in eighth grade. It was hard to make friends at first, but I became close to two friends, one who lived two houses away and another on my street. Neither of them lives here anymore, but I still have happy memories. The people who lived here when I moved in are still here. My neighborhood is like many other American suburban neighborhoods. There are many two-story houses. On nice days, I hear kids playing outside. The neighborhood is usually quiet. I have never had a problem with anyone. If I need help, my neighbors will help me. I can trust them. They respect my personal space. I have ordered packages online many times and never lost them. I feel safe in my neighborhood.\n\nThere is a park near my house. I have many happy memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with my friends. But I also got hurt playing football and hit in the nose! Now, I go to the park to spend time with my younger cousin's kids. They love to play on swings and slides. The park makes me happy and sad at the same time. It reminds me of my childhood.\n\nMy neighborhood is good for many people. We have many kinds of food near us. You can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian food within a mile. Many people order food from apps like GrubHub and DoorDash. We also have fast food places and pizza shops. There are many stores with everything we need. We have a dry cleaner, a pharmacy, and a big grocery store called Jewel-Osco. There is even an Indian store for people who want to make Indian food at home. I like my neighborhood. I am grateful to have good neighbors, unlike some people on social media and in the news.",
            "My town is a small community. It is not different from other places in South Carolina. But it helps the country grow food. Johnston is called the Peach Capital of the World. This is what the town says on its welcome sign. The town is mostly farmland. Many people grow peaches or raise cattle. Houses are far apart. Most are two-story houses with metal or gray roofs. These roofs help keep the houses cool in the hot summer. The houses are not near the road. They are in the fields. In the main part of town, there is a four-way stop. This is where the town's stores are. There are a few places to get food quickly. They are called restaurants. There is Hong Kong, a Chinese restaurant. There is also Fiesta Mexican Restaurant and Gary's, a burger place. There used to be a pizza place, but it closed. There is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They sell a special kind of soda called Cherry Coca-Cola. There is a small grocery store called IGA. People do not buy most of their food there. They usually go to a bigger store in another town. The most popular store is Dollar General. It sells many things. Many people go there every day. There is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. It is run by a kind woman. She has been there for a long time. There is a pet groomer next to the furniture store. They take care of dogs and cats. There is a doctor's office and a vet's office in the town. They are small, but they help the people of Johnston. There is one school called Johnston Elementary School. Children go there until they are in the fifth grade. Then they go to school in another town. The town does not have a park. But they are making a new place for people to play. It will be 2.5 acres big. People can walk their dogs and have fun there. The town is small. But it is a nice place to live.",
            "I first learned about my place on a podcast about people who go missing. I was surprised. It's very expensive to live here. Almost every apartment costs over one thousand dollars a month. My friends and I had not heard of this story. It may be because we have a hard time making ends meet. Some of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we have learned to save money. We like second-hand things, like toys and clothes from a flea market. Adulthood is not as fresh as it used to be. We might start to smoke or just get used to things being a certain way. But the flea market is always there. It smells of dusty old magazines and old furniture.\n\nThere are three thrift stores near my home. I can walk to them. There are two charity thrift stores, a library, a store with old books, and a shop with strange objects. Downtown is busy. Many cars and people are there every morning. But it is quiet in the thrift stores. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the stores are silent. It's a nice place to spend the afternoon.\n\nEvery year, the city gets busier. Many cars and people come here. It's a growing city. One of the biggest companies for online shopping and delivery is here. The city still has some problems. It reminds me of New York. People are focused on their own goals, and they do not ask many questions. You can be alone, quiet, and independent. People will leave you alone if you want. It's not like the South, where people ask about your business. Here, you can be yourself, and the city will go on with its own pace, like the ocean. \n\nI like my apartment. There are people playing music next door and singing upstairs. It's always something happening. We have a community of friends instead of just strangers living in the same building. We help each other when we need it, celebrate birthdays, and mourn when someone dies. I feel lucky to live here. I like my neighbors, and they treat me well. We clean up after ourselves and help each other. It's nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my company too. I live in a big, modern city, but it's people like my neighbors who make me feel like I haven't made a big mistake in my life.",
            "I live in a typical suburb. My neighborhood is part of a community with a homeowner's association. This group makes sure the homes are well-maintained. You will see many single-family houses with small yards. These yards have grass, pebbles, and short driveways. Some houses have two cars. The roads are in good condition. There are no potholes. Most houses are one story, but some are two stories. \n\nMy house is at the edge of the city. This area is both rural and suburban. We have a lot of space for different activities. There are community pools that anyone can use. These pools are well-maintained and locked. We also have walking trails where you can walk your dog or go for a walk alone. You do not need to go to a park to be active. The neighborhood is large, so you can walk or run around it and get exercise.\n\nMost people who live here are retired. The area is safe, and people help each other. Some middle-aged and young professionals also live here. The nearby city is big. It has a small-town feel. We have many things you need. For example, we have a mall. It is not very big, but it has what you need. It takes about 15 minutes to get to a place that is important. When you get there, you can find many stores. There are stores with good food and stores with cheap things.\n\nMy neighborhood is safe and well-maintained. We have nice things like pools and walking trails. We can easily go to a big store if we need something.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest. It is near a big city in the suburbs. My neighborhood is on the east side of the town. It is one of the areas with low income. House prices are low here. Most people rent or buy these houses. However, it is not an unattractive place. My neighbors are friendly. They say hello when I walk by.\n\nCrime rates are a little higher here than in other parts of the town. But they are still low. There have been some violent crimes in the last ten years. Some people have been hurt or killed in shootings. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting last year. But we have not been directly affected by crime. Sometimes things go missing from our porch if we leave them outside.\n\nThe town I live in has a big problem. Many people have died from taking too much of a strong medicine called fentanyl. There are many programs to help people who take too much medicine. These programs include places to help people stop using drugs and training for families and friends of people who have a problem with drugs.\n\nDespite the problems, our town has many good things. My son's school is excellent. The principal, teachers, and other helpers are very good. He is happy there. The school has a positive atmosphere. No one is mean to him. We have a group of parents who help with the school. They plan many fun events. The school gives free breakfast and lunch to all students. No one has to go hungry. The town has fixed some roads and parks. But most of the improvements are in the center of the town where shops are. My neighborhood needs more improvements.\n\nI like living in this town. People are friendly. The schools are good. There are many places to shop. We have a comfortable home. We have lived here for many years and do not want to move.",
            "I live in a neighborhood with a lot of culture. My neighborhood is on a hill. It is surrounded by old buildings with important history. I live in a 7-story building across from a famous theater. A short walk away is a fun bar that is popular with people on summer nights. On weekends in June and July, people often wait in line to get in. We also have a big park nearby. The park is surrounded by concrete with tall stairs. During the cold winter months, homeless people set up tents along the sidewalk and stairs. This keeps them warm and close to a place where they can clean themselves.\n\nI love my neighborhood because of the people. We used to have problems with gangs. The government and police tried to clean up the area many years ago. The people remember. They work hard to keep their community clean. They care about what happens in their neighborhood. Some people say it's not safe for white people to walk around at night. I think this is not true. I think it's because of old ideas and fears. I am a little mixed, which might be why the people here like me. They know I understand their problems. I feel safe walking around at night and meeting new people. They are kind and helpful. For example, they stayed open late so I could charge my phone when it was raining. They saw me sitting alone and cold, and they gave me money and said I was beautiful and important.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan. It is a place where you can see farmland and small cities. There is no big city with many stores like Wal-mart or Target. If you need to go somewhere, you usually have to drive. But I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world. My town is surrounded by water. There is a big lake on one side, Lake Michigan. On the other side is Lake Charlevoix. Everywhere you go, you can find a beach where you can put your feet in the water.\n\nMy neighborhood is a small town. The houses are not stacked on top of each other. They are old homes with basements. Some of the houses have been updated and fixed up. Others are older. Many houses have yards with trampolines and playsets for kids. Some people have gardens and fences for their animals. The houses look like the kind of homes you would see in the middle of the country. People here work hard to make a living. They are raising families or have already raised families. You can see kids playing outside on any day. You can also see people walking their dogs or riding their bikes.\n\nNeighbors know each other. They can tell who belongs and who does not. If someone is grilling outside, you will see them wave. If someone is walking their dog from a few blocks away, you will see them smile and say hello. The lawns are kept neat and tidy. Nobody leaves their leaves on the ground in the fall. The grass is cut and well-manicured. If people have plants and bushes in their yards, they are trimmed and looked after.\n\nMy neighborhood is not fancy, but it is a good place to live. It is quiet and peaceful. It is safe. There are many things within walking distance. There is a police station and a jail. There is a place for recycling and a health department. We also have baseball and softball fields where you can hear the announcers calling the game. There is a small airport nearby where you can hear the sound of small planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream shop. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, which is just a few blocks away. It is a great place to live."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I live in a big city. My neighborhood is very different from others. Small houses are near big buildings. Some buildings are offices, others are stores, restaurants, and places to have fun. There are many new places to eat and shop. Some big companies own some of the stores. But many small stores are popular too. They are in big shopping centers or on streets that people can walk on. My neighborhood is close to parks. I see many people with children in these parks. My neighborhood is also very different because there are many kinds of people. We have a group of people who support the LGBTQ+ community, a Jewish community, and people from the former Soviet Union. There are many more people from different countries and races in other parts of the city. They often live in their own areas. For example, we have an area called Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia. But it can take a long time to get to these places because of traffic. Many people in my city do not walk. The city is very big, and it is hard to walk far. We have a lot of traffic problems. Sometimes it takes a long time to find a parking space. Recently, many new buildings have been built. But some people do not want more people to move in. They do not want more cars on the road. There are many kinds of houses in my city. Not everyone lives in big buildings. We have houses, small apartment buildings, and condominiums. Some houses are for one family, and some have two families. My neighborhood is the same. There are many kinds of houses and people of different ages. I do not know most of my neighbors. But when I was a child, I played with my next-door neighbor and some other friends.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. There are many houses here. Most are single-family homes, but some are split into two, connected houses. My home has a small yard in front and a small driveway to the side. It is like other homes here. They remind us of the past when living in the suburbs was a popular dream in America. But now, fewer people are happy about it. The yards are not as clean as they used to be. There are still cars in most driveways. Children play outside as if nothing is wrong. Our public school, which has been here for almost 90 years, still works. It makes young people think of the future. It also makes older people happy when they remember the past. There are not many churches here, but the basketball courts are always full. All the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a big supermarket called Super A. It belongs to an Arab family who have been here a long time. Most of the people here are African American. The streets are wide, and children play football most of the time. Many people have lived here for years and know each other. They can tell stories about the past when everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school, but it closed because no one wanted to learn karate anymore. Now it is a pharmacy where people buy medicine. There is also a small movie theater that shows old movies at a low price. Children do not like it, but older people enjoy it. They think it is worth the cost for a night out. We have a highway that goes through our town. It starts and ends in the town next to ours. Some people wanted to fix it so it starts and ends here. But older people did not want the highway in our town. They said it would hurt our town. So, the city said no. We are building a new high school and choosing a symbol for our town. I think a robot with a country accent and a log cabin would be a good symbol for our town.",

They see teenagers on skateboards and girls talking about boys and YouTube stars.\n\nThere is a place to buy sushi nearby. It is not very busy.

The city's unofficial slogan is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" This means the city wants to be a place where people can be themselves, even if that is different from others. Some people like this because it was like that long ago. They want to remember the old Portland, a city that was not well-known and was not expensive. This made it a place for creative and unique ideas. To others, it is a call to come and join them. Portland is still a weird place. It is not mean \"weird\" as in always accepting. It means accepting of things that others do not accept. Portland has modern things like other cities. We buy many things from China. But Portland also has a million ways to be different. In my neighborhood, there are colorful houses and gardens with flowers and vegetables. In the summer, there are boxes on the street with things people are giving away for free. These boxes can have anything - clothes, books, or other things. This is the magic of Portland. It is a city where you can find something special by chance. Portland is full of people who love many things. Some people go to yoga with goats, while others watch the city's soccer team play. Everyone in Portland likes something different. We have people who chase their dreams, or dream about chasing their dreams while spending time at the bar. Yes, Portland has problems with drugs. These problems are often connected to mental health. The rainy weather and gray skies may also be a part of the problem. Portland also has a problem with homelessness. Many people come here for help, but we do not have enough help for them. The people who are not homeless sometimes feel angry or sad about the situation. But this is not weird. It is a problem many cities face.",
            "The mountains are always there. They are in the north. They see the sun every morning and every evening. I often forget about them when I am busy with work and life. But they are always there, steady and strong. On days when I am very stressed and sad, they help me feel better. I look at them and I feel a little stronger. I came to this town when I began my university studies. The mountains north of the campus were very beautiful. The university has many nice buildings and a pond. But the mountains are special. The rest of the town is also nice. There are many cafes where I studied and drank coffee. I can walk or take a bus to the downtown area. It is old and has a lot of character. The town is small but it has a lot of life. The town is near a big city. But it is easy to get away from the noise and be in a peaceful place. I have made many happy memories in this town. I walked with friends in the park and we saw the swings. We also went to the movies in a big theater. But this town also remembers sad times. I cried by the pond in the middle of the night. I thought about my life and my purpose. As I watched the animals by the pond, I wondered about my own life. I walked by the pond and the park and then I saw the main street. The sun was shining and it was beautiful. I looked up at the sun and I walked north. And there they were, the mountains. They were still there, strong and steady. They reminded me to keep going.",
            "Bensonhurt in Brooklyn is easy to find. Public transportation is good and is used by many people. This neighborhood is part of New York City. It is an urban area, but you can still feel like you are in a big city. Many Asian stores are there. Over the past 20 years, many Asian people have moved to Bensonhurt. You will see Asian-owned stores on almost every block. These stores are popular for food, laundry, and more. The food is good, prices are low, and it is convenient. I live here, and there are four Asian supermarkets within a short walk. This makes buying groceries easy.\n\nNot all people in Bensonhurt are Asian. Many immigrants and their children live here too. Most of the big stores are Asian-owned. There is also a park near me. It has many basketball courts, a big field for sports, handball courts, swings, and a water fountain for kids.\n\nBensonhurt has many two-family houses and co-op living buildings. People are generally nice, but it can be noisy. Cars drive by and play loud music. Some people also drive fast, which can wake you up. If you visit at night, be careful. This neighborhood is safe, but some people may cause trouble. I was bullied here a long time ago. Recently, people have stolen packages from each other. It's also a problem that people don't clean up after their dogs. You will see dog waste on the sidewalk every day. Keep your shoes clean when you walk here.",
            "My neighborhood has no sidewalks. Everything goes downhill. My house is on the top of the biggest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"workout hill\" because many people run up it every day. Because there are no sidewalks on my street, everyone walks on the road. The road is not in good shape in some places, and it's not safe to drive on. The wires on my street are old and broken. The weather is rainy and stormy here, so the trees hit the wires often. The repairs make the wires look old and broken. There are many tall trees everywhere. But people do not like the trees. They try to cut down many of them. The trees block the view of the ocean. That's why many houses are built high up on the hill. They have big windows on the top floor to see the bay. It's nice to see the bay at sunset. The water shines and the sky turns orange. But it's often cloudy. Most days are gray and damp. Moss grows on everything. I left my car outside for a month, and it was covered in moss. It took three hours to clean it. There are not many children in my neighborhood. There is a school a few blocks away. Many people in my neighborhood are old and retired. They have dogs instead of children. You often see them in people's yards or running down the street. If you leave a door or window open, they can get into your house. I once found one in my living room. I had to chase it out. Rabbits are also a problem. They dig up plants and make holes in people's lawns. My cats like to hunt them. We also have birds like sparrows and hummingbirds. Sometimes a hawk or eagle comes, but the crows chase it away. There are no stores near my house. But if you walk down to the waterfront, there are some restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There is no beach, but you can throw rocks into the water. The bay is not very wide. You can see the other side even on cloudy days.",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. My street is between two highways, so there is some traffic. But it is a quiet neighborhood. Most people on my street are friendly. They keep to themselves and do their own work. In the winter, I like to sled on a hill near my house. We have a big house at the front of our street, so we see everyone who passes by. We know most of the cars in the neighborhood. When we see a new car, we pay attention. Some neighbors walk for exercise or to take their dogs out. Children ride their bikes and play outside. My family and I work from home. There are four of us: my wife and our two daughters, ages 11 and 14. We are used to seeing each other come and go. We like to play outside, even in the rain. Sometimes we grill on our back deck. The smell of barbecue is nice. We have many trees in our neighborhood. The area was once a forest, so there is a lot of shade. But in the fall, there are many leaves, and we have to rake and burn them. The smell of burning leaves means fall is here. Lately, we have not had much winter. It feels like fall is long. Our garage is at the back of our house. We use the front door only when someone visits. I like to work in the garage and fix things. When the garage door is open, I feel connected to the neighborhood. Holidays are quiet here. On Thanksgiving, some families visit from out of town, and there are many extra cars. Other holidays, like Mother's Day and Christmas, are the same.\n\nI like living here. If the street were not a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My home is in a desert area. It is very dry and brown. If you have never lived in a place like this, you may not understand what it is like. I have lived here since the 1990s. Many houses are spread out. But recently, new houses have been built. Now it looks like a city. Many places are changing like this. Most people are friendly. However, some are not. I like my neighborhood. There are old people who are nice. The stores are mostly big chains like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. There are no stores like Whole Foods. If you want to buy healthy food, you have to go somewhere else. Many people work in construction. This city is not very developed yet. There is still much empty space. I do not like this. I left a big city and do not want to go back. My job is in construction. I install drywall and T-bars. I like the animals here. People come to the desert for its beauty. It is hard to live here because of the animals. We must learn about them to live safely. My children like lizards and desert bugs. They are outside trying to catch them now. Victorville is a good place for families. It is a good experience. If you visit, go to the San Bernardino County Fair. It is an annual event. You can also go to Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and take winter sports lessons. If you like history and culture, visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has objects from the past that tell the story of Victorville's development.",
            "When I describe my neighborhood, it is different from others. I live on a college campus. My community is the people in my dormitory. The campus is also my neighborhood. It is not like a usual neighborhood, but it has some similar things. It has houses, people, stores, and a park.\n\nLet's start with the houses. My neighborhood has three types of houses. There are apartments, houses, and dormitories. The apartments usually have 2-4 people in each room. The dormitories are very common and have 100s of students. Each student shares a room with one other person.\n\nIn my neighborhood, there are people from many different cultures and ages. Many of the staff live in the houses. The newer students live in the dormitories, and the older students live in the apartments.\n\nNow, let's talk about the stores and park. The campus is a self-contained neighborhood, so it has many stores. These stores sell food, clothes, and other things you need. The park is a place for everyone in the neighborhood to play. The park is clean and safe because everyone helps keep it that way.",
            "I have lived in this neighborhood for about 10 years. When I first came here from Riverdale, I was sad. I missed my old home and friends. My mom and dad made us move because they wanted a better life for my sister and me. Here, we have a good house and a better school. Over time, I made new friends and enemies at school. I didn't know my neighbors very well, except Mr. Glen and his children. They are kind people and I consider them like family.\n\nI remember Mr. Glen's wedding. It was fun. I caught a special strap that Ms. Veda wore. I also met one of their daughters, Marsharii. I haven't seen her in a long time. I hope she is happy.\n\nThe neighborhood is like a maze. I use a GPS to help me get around. I have explored some of it with my friends Kason and Curtis. We like to play video games and have fun. I also like to go to the park and be near nature. It makes me feel calm. I take sticks and practice my balance. I also have a wooden sword and like to play with it.\n\nThere is a basketball and tennis court. I used to play tennis with my dad and his friend, Mr. Graves. We worked hard, but it was fun. I hope to play again soon. I have many good memories in this neighborhood, and I think the best is yet to come.",
            "I live in a neighborhood near my college. I enjoy living here because it is close to school. There are many apartment buildings, some restaurants and bars. I like going to these places because they are not very expensive. One bar changed its name, and it is a bit more expensive. However, it is not bad. Many people are friendly. They are mostly students or people who cannot afford to live in other places because the rent is low here.\n\nThere is a school near my apartment. This is why there are many children. I do not know my neighbors very well. They smoke a lot of marijuana. My landlord put a special machine in their apartment to remove bad smells. I think this is funny. My boyfriend and I found it strange.\n\nThe buildings around me are old, but they may have new inside. Some buildings across the street are brand new. But I do not like them. They are built poorly, and the rent is high. I think this is not fair. They are near the campus, so they can get away with it.\n\nI like a small restaurant near my home. It is cheap, and they serve food quickly. There is a gas station near it, but people do not like working there. The city fixed the road near my home last year, so it is nicer now. My apartment building has trees around it. The city cut down some trees, but there are still many.\n\nBehind my building is a line of trees and another apartment complex. I live on 42nd Street. The street behind mine is 43rd Street. It is not as nice. The sidewalks are broken, and the buildings look old. There are many trees here, but they hide the buildings. There is a lot of crime on 43rd Street. It is not just the one apartment complex, though. There are other apartments with problems too. I like where I live because it is affordable, and I have many things near me. The university is close, and there are two bus stops. I can easily go to the store or downtown.",
            "My neighborhood is special. It has many houses on a circle. These houses look like separate homes. The only difference is they are all painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Most people are friends with each other. We stand at the end of the road and talk in the evenings. Children play outside with toys and chalk. It is nice to be here in a world with many machines. It is like going backward in time.\n\nWe are near fields and trees. The sky is blue and white clouds are everywhere. But sometimes we have problems. This time of year, we have warnings about tornadoes. Recently, we heard sirens and had to seek shelter. I was in my bathtub with my little dog and a few pillows. My big dog stayed in the living room and barked. The neighborhood was quiet with only the sound of hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road was hot and steaming. We had a big temperature change. The hail melted quickly on the hot pavement. Then the sun came out and it started to rain. I saw a double rainbow. I quickly took pictures with my camera. My friends on Facebook were amazed, just like me.\n\nThe neighborhood was quiet for a while after the storm. Then people started coming home. They were cooking dinner. It is a friendly neighborhood. I like it here. I moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina a while back. I like the way people talk down here. I have a two-bedroom apartment, like most people. But not all apartments are the same inside. Some are small. I like to walk in the big field behind my house. I go to the pond, but it is not safe to swim. I see deer and hear a big frog in the morning. It is a great place to live, near the city of Charlotte. Each morning, I hear roosters. It is like living in a small village. We have a donkey at a nearby farm who brays in the evening. I was lucky to find this neighborhood.",
            "I moved to my new neighborhood when I was in eighth grade. It was hard to make friends at first, but I became close to two friends, one who lived two houses away and another on my street. Neither of them lives here anymore, but I still have happy memories. The people who lived here when I moved in are still here. My neighborhood is like many other American suburban neighborhoods. There are many two-story houses. On nice days, I hear kids playing outside. The neighborhood is usually quiet. I have never had a problem with anyone. If I need help, my neighbors will help me. I can trust them. They respect my personal space. I have ordered packages online many times and never lost them. I feel safe in my neighborhood.\n\nThere is a park near my house. I have many happy memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with my friends. But I also got hurt playing football and hit in the nose! Now, I go to the park to spend time with my younger cousin's kids. They love to play on swings and slides. The park makes me happy and sad at the same time. It reminds me of my childhood.\n\nMy neighborhood is good for many people. We have many kinds of food near us. You can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian food within a mile. Many people order food from apps like GrubHub and DoorDash. We also have fast food places and pizza shops. There are many stores with everything we need. We have a dry cleaner, a pharmacy, and a big grocery store called Jewel-Osco. There is even an Indian store for people who want to make Indian food at home. I like my neighborhood. I am grateful to have good neighbors, unlike some people on social media and in the news.",
            "My town is a small community. It is not different from other places in South Carolina. But it helps the country grow food. Johnston is called the Peach Capital of the World. This is what the town says on its welcome sign. The town is mostly farmland. Many people grow peaches or raise cattle. Houses are far apart. Most are two-story houses with metal or gray roofs. These roofs help keep the houses cool in the hot summer. The houses are not near the road. They are in the fields. In the main part of town, there is a four-way stop. This is where the town's stores are. There are a few places to get food quickly. They are called restaurants. There is Hong Kong, a Chinese restaurant. There is also Fiesta Mexican Restaurant and Gary's, a burger place. There used to be a pizza place, but it closed. There is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They sell a special kind of soda called Cherry Coca-Cola. There is a small grocery store called IGA. People do not buy most of their food there. They usually go to a bigger store in another town. The most popular store is Dollar General. It sells many things. Many people go there every day. There is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. It is run by a kind woman. She has been there for a long time. There is a pet groomer next to the furniture store. They take care of dogs and cats. There is a doctor's office and a vet's office in the town. They are small, but they help the people of Johnston. There is one school called Johnston Elementary School. Children go there until they are in the fifth grade. Then they go to school in another town. The town does not have a park. But they are making a new place for people to play. It will be 2.5 acres big. People can walk their dogs and have fun there. The town is small. But it is a nice place to live.",
            "I first learned about my place on a podcast about people who go missing. I was surprised. It's very expensive to live here. Almost every apartment costs over one thousand dollars a month. My friends and I had not heard of this story. It may be because we have a hard time making ends meet. Some of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we have learned to save money. We like second-hand things, like toys and clothes from a flea market. Adulthood is not as fresh as it used to be. We might start to smoke or just get used to things being a certain way. But the flea market is always there. It smells of dusty old magazines and old furniture.\n\nThere are three thrift stores near my home. I can walk to them. There are two charity thrift stores, a library, a store with old books, and a shop with strange objects. Downtown is busy. Many cars and people are there every morning. But it is quiet in the thrift stores. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the stores are silent. It's a nice place to spend the afternoon.\n\nEvery year, the city gets busier. Many cars and people come here. It's a growing city. One of the biggest companies for online shopping and delivery is here. The city still has some problems. It reminds me of New York. People are focused on their own goals, and they do not ask many questions. You can be alone, quiet, and independent. People will leave you alone if you want. It's not like the South, where people ask about your business. Here, you can be yourself, and the city will go on with its own pace, like the ocean. \n\nI like my apartment. There are people playing music next door and singing upstairs. It's always something happening. We have a community of friends instead of just strangers living in the same building. We help each other when we need it, celebrate birthdays, and mourn when someone dies. I feel lucky to live here. I like my neighbors, and they treat me well. We clean up after ourselves and help each other. It's nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my company too. I live in a big, modern city, but it's people like my neighbors who make me feel like I haven't made a big mistake in my life.",
            "I live in a typical suburb. My neighborhood is part of a community with a homeowner's association. This group makes sure the homes are well-maintained. You will see many single-family houses with small yards. These yards have grass, pebbles, and short driveways. Some houses have two cars. The roads are in good condition. There are no potholes. Most houses are one story, but some are two stories. \n\nMy house is at the edge of the city. This area is both rural and suburban. We have a lot of space for different activities. There are community pools that anyone can use. These pools are well-maintained and locked. We also have walking trails where you can walk your dog or go for a walk alone. You do not need to go to a park to be active. The neighborhood is large, so you can walk or run around it and get exercise.\n\nMost people who live here are retired. The area is safe, and people help each other. Some middle-aged and young professionals also live here. The nearby city is big. It has a small-town feel. We have many things you need. For example, we have a mall. It is not very big, but it has what you need. It takes about 15 minutes to get to a place that is important. When you get there, you can find many stores. There are stores with good food and stores with cheap things.\n\nMy neighborhood is safe and well-maintained. We have nice things like pools and walking trails. We can easily go to a big store if we need something.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest. It is near a big city in the suburbs. My neighborhood is on the east side of the town. It is one of the areas with low income. House prices are low here. Most people rent or buy these houses. However, it is not an unattractive place. My neighbors are friendly. They say hello when I walk by.\n\nCrime rates are a little higher here than in other parts of the town. But they are still low. There have been some violent crimes in the last ten years. Some people have been hurt or killed in shootings. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting last year. But we have not been directly affected by crime. Sometimes things go missing from our porch if we leave them outside.\n\nThe town I live in has a big problem. Many people have died from taking too much of a strong medicine called fentanyl. There are many programs to help people who take too much medicine. These programs include places to help people stop using drugs and training for families and friends of people who have a problem with drugs.\n\nDespite the problems, our town has many good things. My son's school is excellent. The principal, teachers, and other helpers are very good. He is happy there. The school has a positive atmosphere. No one is mean to him. We have a group of parents who help with the school. They plan many fun events. The school gives free breakfast and lunch to all students. No one has to go hungry. The town has fixed some roads and parks. But most of the improvements are in the center of the town where shops are. My neighborhood needs more improvements.\n\nI like living in this town. People are friendly. The schools are good. There are many places to shop. We have a comfortable home. We have lived here for many years and do not want to move.",
            "I live in a neighborhood with a lot of culture. My neighborhood is on a hill. It is surrounded by old buildings with important history. I live in a 7-story building across from a famous theater. A short walk away is a fun bar that is popular with people on summer nights. On weekends in June and July, people often wait in line to get in. We also have a big park nearby. The park is surrounded by concrete with tall stairs. During the cold winter months, homeless people set up tents along the sidewalk and stairs. This keeps them warm and close to a place where they can clean themselves.\n\nI love my neighborhood because of the people. We used to have problems with gangs. The government and police tried to clean up the area many years ago. The people remember. They work hard to keep their community clean. They care about what happens in their neighborhood. Some people say it's not safe for white people to walk around at night. I think this is not true. I think it's because of old ideas and fears. I am a little mixed, which might be why the people here like me. They know I understand their problems. I feel safe walking around at night and meeting new people. They are kind and helpful. For example, they stayed open late so I could charge my phone when it was raining. They saw me sitting alone and cold, and they gave me money and said I was beautiful and important.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan. It is a place where you can see farmland and small cities. There is no big city with many stores like Wal-mart or Target. If you need to go somewhere, you usually have to drive. But I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world. My town is surrounded by water. There is a big lake on one side, Lake Michigan. On the other side is Lake Charlevoix. Everywhere you go, you can find a beach where you can put your feet in the water.\n\nMy neighborhood is a small town. The houses are not stacked on top of each other. They are old homes with basements. Some of the houses have been updated and fixed up. Others are older. Many houses have yards with trampolines and playsets for kids. Some people have gardens and fences for their animals. The houses look like the kind of homes you would see in the middle of the country. People here work hard to make a living. They are raising families or have already raised families. You can see kids playing outside on any day. You can also see people walking their dogs or riding their bikes.\n\nNeighbors know each other. They can tell who belongs and who does not. If someone is grilling outside, you will see them wave. If someone is walking their dog from a few blocks away, you will see them smile and say hello. The lawns are kept neat and tidy. Nobody leaves their leaves on the ground in the fall. The grass is cut and well-manicured. If people have plants and bushes in their yards, they are trimmed and looked after.\n\nMy neighborhood is not fancy, but it is a good place to live. It is quiet and peaceful. It is safe. There are many things within walking distance. There is a police station and a jail. There is a place for recycling and a health department. We also have baseball and softball fields where you can hear the announcers calling the game. There is a small airport nearby where you can hear the sound of small planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream shop. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, which is just a few blocks away. It is a great place to live."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I live in a big city. My neighborhood is very different from others. Small houses are near big buildings. Some buildings are offices, others are stores, restaurants, and places to have fun. There are many new places to eat and shop. Some big companies own some of the stores. But many small stores are popular too. They are in big shopping centers or on streets that people can walk on. My neighborhood is close to parks. I see many people with children in these parks. My neighborhood is also very different because there are many kinds of people. We have a group of people who support the LGBTQ+ community, a Jewish community, and people from the former Soviet Union. There are many more people from different countries and races in other parts of the city. They often live in their own areas. For example, we have an area called Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia. But it can take a long time to get to these places because of traffic. Many people in my city do not walk. The city is very big, and it is hard to walk far. We have a lot of traffic problems. Sometimes it takes a long time to find a parking space. Recently, many new buildings have been built. But some people do not want more people to move in. They do not want more cars on the road. There are many kinds of houses in my city. Not everyone lives in big buildings. We have houses, small apartment buildings, and condominiums. Some houses are for one family, and some have two families. My neighborhood is the same. There are many kinds of houses and people of different ages. I do not know most of my neighbors. But when I was a child, I played with my next-door neighbor and some other friends.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. There are many houses here. Most are single-family homes, but some are split into two, connected houses. My home has a small yard in front and a small driveway to the side. It is like other homes here. They remind us of the past when living in the suburbs was a popular dream in America. But now, fewer people are happy about it. The yards are not as clean as they used to be. There are still cars in most driveways. Children play outside as if nothing is wrong. Our public school, which has been here for almost 90 years, still works. It makes young people think of the future. It also makes older people happy when they remember the past. There are not many churches here, but the basketball courts are always full. All the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a big supermarket called Super A. It belongs to an Arab family who have been here a long time. Most of the people here are African American. The streets are wide, and children play football most of the time. Many people have lived here for years and know each other. They can tell stories about the past when everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school, but it closed because no one wanted to learn karate anymore. Now it is a pharmacy where people buy medicine. There is also a small movie theater that shows old movies at a low price. Children do not like it, but older people enjoy it. They think it is worth the cost for a night out. We have a highway that goes through our town. It starts and ends in the town next to ours. Some people wanted to fix it so it starts and ends here. But older people did not want the highway in our town. They said it would hurt our town. So, the city said no. We are building a new high school and choosing a symbol for our town. I think a robot with a country accent and a log cabin would be a good symbol for our town.",

But if you walk behind the old, empty Whole Foods and go past the hotels, you will see a busy community. These hotels are only used by families for summer vacations.\n\nThere are some apartment buildings there. They are like Russian dolls that have been taken apart and put side by side. Some of the apartments have been in the news for bad reasons. We will not talk about them. But the other buildings are a different story. Almost no one in this area knows about them.\n\nAcross from the apartments is a college campus. It is quiet and sleepy. Students go there in the morning to learn. The gates open slowly, and people driving by get angry because it makes traffic. The road meets another street with a park and a place that helps people who break their bones. The park is nice, with flowers and a fan that moves the warm air. Children play in the park, and old people walk their dogs. They see teenagers on skateboards and girls talking about boys and YouTube stars.\n\nThere is a place to buy sushi nearby. It is not very busy. There is also a store to buy pool supplies and a place to get a manicure. You can fill your pool and get a manicure at the same time. There is also a place to buy frozen yogurt. Teenagers like to eat it while doing tricks on their skateboards.\n\nThis neighborhood is a special place. It is a part of American history in a quiet place where not much changes.",
            "She asked, \"Where is everything?\" as we drove past big fields of corn. They went as far as the eye could see. I said, \"This is it!\" She was from a city. She had never seen so much open space in her life. She came from a place where a grocery store was just a five-minute walk from her home.\n\nI told her what it was like to grow up in a small town in Ohio. I explained that I lived far from the city. She listened. Then she understood where I was from. \n\nAs we drove on a two-lane road, we came to a big hole in the ground filled with water. Just past that was the small place where I live. The houses are made of brick and stucco. They are all nice. Every house has a big yard. People take good care of their yards.\n\nIn the spring, flowers bloom. The trees change with the seasons. The driveways are filled with nice cars. They shine in the sun after they are washed. My neighbor is a friendly man. He is from Korea. He always mows his lawn. He sings while he works. People like to laugh at him, but he is a kind and interesting man. He used to be a doctor.\n\nAs we continued down the road, we came to my house. There are many geese in the yard. They run away from our dog. In back, there is a small stream. The stream feeds the big hole in the ground. You can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the sound of cows from the nearby farms. Across a small bridge is a special place. It is full of trees, herbs, and wildflowers that grew by themselves. This is where I spent most of my childhood. I built forts in the trees. I also liked to chase animals. There were always friends to play with.\n\nIn the winter, the weather can be very cold. But it is also beautiful. The trees are bare. The flowers are gone. The yard is empty. When it snows, the yard looks like a winter wonderland. My sister and I made snow angels and built snowmen. We also made forts to play in. We used sticks and snowballs to fight. We were just kids and did not worry about anything.",
            "You must understand one thing about Portland, Oregon. It is a city that likes to be different. The city's unofficial slogan is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" This means the city wants to be a place where people can be themselves, even if that is different from others. Some people like this because it was like that long ago. They want to remember the old Portland, a city that was not well-known and was not expensive. This made it a place for creative and unique ideas. To others, it is a call to come and join them. Portland is still a weird place. It is not mean \"weird\" as in always accepting. It means accepting of things that others do not accept. Portland has modern things like other cities. We buy many things from China. But Portland also has a million ways to be different. In my neighborhood, there are colorful houses and gardens with flowers and vegetables. In the summer, there are boxes on the street with things people are giving away for free. These boxes can have anything - clothes, books, or other things. This is the magic of Portland. It is a city where you can find something special by chance. Portland is full of people who love many things. Some people go to yoga with goats, while others watch the city's soccer team play. Everyone in Portland likes something different. We have people who chase their dreams, or dream about chasing their dreams while spending time at the bar. Yes, Portland has problems with drugs. These problems are often connected to mental health. The rainy weather and gray skies may also be a part of the problem. Portland also has a problem with homelessness. Many people come here for help, but we do not have enough help for them. The people who are not homeless sometimes feel angry or sad about the situation. But this is not weird. It is a problem many cities face.",
            "The mountains are always there. They are in the north. They see the sun every morning and every evening. I often forget about them when I am busy with work and life. But they are always there, steady and strong. On days when I am very stressed and sad, they help me feel better. I look at them and I feel a little stronger. I came to this town when I began my university studies. The mountains north of the campus were very beautiful. The university has many nice buildings and a pond. But the mountains are special. The rest of the town is also nice. There are many cafes where I studied and drank coffee. I can walk or take a bus to the downtown area. It is old and has a lot of character. The town is small but it has a lot of life. The town is near a big city. But it is easy to get away from the noise and be in a peaceful place. I have made many happy memories in this town. I walked with friends in the park and we saw the swings. We also went to the movies in a big theater. But this town also remembers sad times. I cried by the pond in the middle of the night. I thought about my life and my purpose. As I watched the animals by the pond, I wondered about my own life. I walked by the pond and the park and then I saw the main street. The sun was shining and it was beautiful. I looked up at the sun and I walked north. And there they were, the mountains. They were still there, strong and steady. They reminded me to keep going.",
            "Bensonhurt in Brooklyn is easy to find. Public transportation is good and is used by many people. This neighborhood is part of New York City. It is an urban area, but you can still feel like you are in a big city. Many Asian stores are there. Over the past 20 years, many Asian people have moved to Bensonhurt. You will see Asian-owned stores on almost every block. These stores are popular for food, laundry, and more. The food is good, prices are low, and it is convenient. I live here, and there are four Asian supermarkets within a short walk. This makes buying groceries easy.\n\nNot all people in Bensonhurt are Asian. Many immigrants and their children live here too. Most of the big stores are Asian-owned. There is also a park near me. It has many basketball courts, a big field for sports, handball courts, swings, and a water fountain for kids.\n\nBensonhurt has many two-family houses and co-op living buildings. People are generally nice, but it can be noisy. Cars drive by and play loud music. Some people also drive fast, which can wake you up. If you visit at night, be careful. This neighborhood is safe, but some people may cause trouble. I was bullied here a long time ago. Recently, people have stolen packages from each other. It's also a problem that people don't clean up after their dogs. You will see dog waste on the sidewalk every day. Keep your shoes clean when you walk here.",
            "My neighborhood has no sidewalks. Everything goes downhill. My house is on the top of the biggest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"workout hill\" because many people run up it every day. Because there are no sidewalks on my street, everyone walks on the road. The road is not in good shape in some places, and it's not safe to drive on. The wires on my street are old and broken. The weather is rainy and stormy here, so the trees hit the wires often. The repairs make the wires look old and broken. There are many tall trees everywhere. But people do not like the trees. They try to cut down many of them. The trees block the view of the ocean. That's why many houses are built high up on the hill. They have big windows on the top floor to see the bay. It's nice to see the bay at sunset. The water shines and the sky turns orange. But it's often cloudy. Most days are gray and damp. Moss grows on everything. I left my car outside for a month, and it was covered in moss. It took three hours to clean it. There are not many children in my neighborhood. There is a school a few blocks away. Many people in my neighborhood are old and retired. They have dogs instead of children. You often see them in people's yards or running down the street. If you leave a door or window open, they can get into your house. I once found one in my living room. I had to chase it out. Rabbits are also a problem. They dig up plants and make holes in people's lawns. My cats like to hunt them. We also have birds like sparrows and hummingbirds. Sometimes a hawk or eagle comes, but the crows chase it away. There are no stores near my house. But if you walk down to the waterfront, there are some restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There is no beach, but you can throw rocks into the water. The bay is not very wide. You can see the other side even on cloudy days.",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. My street is between two highways, so there is some traffic. But it is a quiet neighborhood. Most people on my street are friendly. They keep to themselves and do their own work. In the winter, I like to sled on a hill near my house. We have a big house at the front of our street, so we see everyone who passes by. We know most of the cars in the neighborhood. When we see a new car, we pay attention. Some neighbors walk for exercise or to take their dogs out. Children ride their bikes and play outside. My family and I work from home. There are four of us: my wife and our two daughters, ages 11 and 14. We are used to seeing each other come and go. We like to play outside, even in the rain. Sometimes we grill on our back deck. The smell of barbecue is nice. We have many trees in our neighborhood. The area was once a forest, so there is a lot of shade. But in the fall, there are many leaves, and we have to rake and burn them. The smell of burning leaves means fall is here. Lately, we have not had much winter. It feels like fall is long. Our garage is at the back of our house. We use the front door only when someone visits. I like to work in the garage and fix things. When the garage door is open, I feel connected to the neighborhood. Holidays are quiet here. On Thanksgiving, some families visit from out of town, and there are many extra cars. Other holidays, like Mother's Day and Christmas, are the same.\n\nI like living here. If the street were not a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My home is in a desert area. It is very dry and brown. If you have never lived in a place like this, you may not understand what it is like. I have lived here since the 1990s. Many houses are spread out. But recently, new houses have been built. Now it looks like a city. Many places are changing like this. Most people are friendly. However, some are not. I like my neighborhood. There are old people who are nice. The stores are mostly big chains like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. There are no stores like Whole Foods. If you want to buy healthy food, you have to go somewhere else. Many people work in construction. This city is not very developed yet. There is still much empty space. I do not like this. I left a big city and do not want to go back. My job is in construction. I install drywall and T-bars. I like the animals here. People come to the desert for its beauty. It is hard to live here because of the animals. We must learn about them to live safely. My children like lizards and desert bugs. They are outside trying to catch them now. Victorville is a good place for families. It is a good experience. If you visit, go to the San Bernardino County Fair. It is an annual event. You can also go to Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and take winter sports lessons. If you like history and culture, visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has objects from the past that tell the story of Victorville's development.",
            "When I describe my neighborhood, it is different from others. I live on a college campus. My community is the people in my dormitory. The campus is also my neighborhood. It is not like a usual neighborhood, but it has some similar things. It has houses, people, stores, and a park.\n\nLet's start with the houses. My neighborhood has three types of houses. There are apartments, houses, and dormitories. The apartments usually have 2-4 people in each room. The dormitories are very common and have 100s of students. Each student shares a room with one other person.\n\nIn my neighborhood, there are people from many different cultures and ages. Many of the staff live in the houses. The newer students live in the dormitories, and the older students live in the apartments.\n\nNow, let's talk about the stores and park. The campus is a self-contained neighborhood, so it has many stores. These stores sell food, clothes, and other things you need. The park is a place for everyone in the neighborhood to play. The park is clean and safe because everyone helps keep it that way.",
            "I have lived in this neighborhood for about 10 years. When I first came here from Riverdale, I was sad. I missed my old home and friends. My mom and dad made us move because they wanted a better life for my sister and me. Here, we have a good house and a better school. Over time, I made new friends and enemies at school. I didn't know my neighbors very well, except Mr. Glen and his children. They are kind people and I consider them like family.\n\nI remember Mr. Glen's wedding. It was fun. I caught a special strap that Ms. Veda wore. I also met one of their daughters, Marsharii. I haven't seen her in a long time. I hope she is happy.\n\nThe neighborhood is like a maze. I use a GPS to help me get around. I have explored some of it with my friends Kason and Curtis. We like to play video games and have fun. I also like to go to the park and be near nature. It makes me feel calm. I take sticks and practice my balance. I also have a wooden sword and like to play with it.\n\nThere is a basketball and tennis court. I used to play tennis with my dad and his friend, Mr. Graves. We worked hard, but it was fun. I hope to play again soon. I have many good memories in this neighborhood, and I think the best is yet to come.",
            "I live in a neighborhood near my college. I enjoy living here because it is close to school. There are many apartment buildings, some restaurants and bars. I like going to these places because they are not very expensive. One bar changed its name, and it is a bit more expensive. However, it is not bad. Many people are friendly. They are mostly students or people who cannot afford to live in other places because the rent is low here.\n\nThere is a school near my apartment. This is why there are many children. I do not know my neighbors very well. They smoke a lot of marijuana. My landlord put a special machine in their apartment to remove bad smells. I think this is funny. My boyfriend and I found it strange.\n\nThe buildings around me are old, but they may have new inside. Some buildings across the street are brand new. But I do not like them. They are built poorly, and the rent is high. I think this is not fair. They are near the campus, so they can get away with it.\n\nI like a small restaurant near my home. It is cheap, and they serve food quickly. There is a gas station near it, but people do not like working there. The city fixed the road near my home last year, so it is nicer now. My apartment building has trees around it. The city cut down some trees, but there are still many.\n\nBehind my building is a line of trees and another apartment complex. I live on 42nd Street. The street behind mine is 43rd Street. It is not as nice. The sidewalks are broken, and the buildings look old. There are many trees here, but they hide the buildings. There is a lot of crime on 43rd Street. It is not just the one apartment complex, though. There are other apartments with problems too. I like where I live because it is affordable, and I have many things near me. The university is close, and there are two bus stops. I can easily go to the store or downtown.",
            "My neighborhood is special. It has many houses on a circle. These houses look like separate homes. The only difference is they are all painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Most people are friends with each other. We stand at the end of the road and talk in the evenings. Children play outside with toys and chalk. It is nice to be here in a world with many machines. It is like going backward in time.\n\nWe are near fields and trees. The sky is blue and white clouds are everywhere. But sometimes we have problems. This time of year, we have warnings about tornadoes. Recently, we heard sirens and had to seek shelter. I was in my bathtub with my little dog and a few pillows. My big dog stayed in the living room and barked. The neighborhood was quiet with only the sound of hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road was hot and steaming. We had a big temperature change. The hail melted quickly on the hot pavement. Then the sun came out and it started to rain. I saw a double rainbow. I quickly took pictures with my camera. My friends on Facebook were amazed, just like me.\n\nThe neighborhood was quiet for a while after the storm. Then people started coming home. They were cooking dinner. It is a friendly neighborhood. I like it here. I moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina a while back. I like the way people talk down here. I have a two-bedroom apartment, like most people. But not all apartments are the same inside. Some are small. I like to walk in the big field behind my house. I go to the pond, but it is not safe to swim. I see deer and hear a big frog in the morning. It is a great place to live, near the city of Charlotte. Each morning, I hear roosters. It is like living in a small village. We have a donkey at a nearby farm who brays in the evening. I was lucky to find this neighborhood.",
            "I moved to my new neighborhood when I was in eighth grade. It was hard to make friends at first, but I became close to two friends, one who lived two houses away and another on my street. Neither of them lives here anymore, but I still have happy memories. The people who lived here when I moved in are still here. My neighborhood is like many other American suburban neighborhoods. There are many two-story houses. On nice days, I hear kids playing outside. The neighborhood is usually quiet. I have never had a problem with anyone. If I need help, my neighbors will help me. I can trust them. They respect my personal space. I have ordered packages online many times and never lost them. I feel safe in my neighborhood.\n\nThere is a park near my house. I have many happy memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with my friends. But I also got hurt playing football and hit in the nose! Now, I go to the park to spend time with my younger cousin's kids. They love to play on swings and slides. The park makes me happy and sad at the same time. It reminds me of my childhood.\n\nMy neighborhood is good for many people. We have many kinds of food near us. You can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian food within a mile. Many people order food from apps like GrubHub and DoorDash. We also have fast food places and pizza shops. There are many stores with everything we need. We have a dry cleaner, a pharmacy, and a big grocery store called Jewel-Osco. There is even an Indian store for people who want to make Indian food at home. I like my neighborhood. I am grateful to have good neighbors, unlike some people on social media and in the news.",
            "My town is a small community. It is not different from other places in South Carolina. But it helps the country grow food. Johnston is called the Peach Capital of the World. This is what the town says on its welcome sign. The town is mostly farmland. Many people grow peaches or raise cattle. Houses are far apart. Most are two-story houses with metal or gray roofs. These roofs help keep the houses cool in the hot summer. The houses are not near the road. They are in the fields. In the main part of town, there is a four-way stop. This is where the town's stores are. There are a few places to get food quickly. They are called restaurants. There is Hong Kong, a Chinese restaurant. There is also Fiesta Mexican Restaurant and Gary's, a burger place. There used to be a pizza place, but it closed. There is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They sell a special kind of soda called Cherry Coca-Cola. There is a small grocery store called IGA. People do not buy most of their food there. They usually go to a bigger store in another town. The most popular store is Dollar General. It sells many things. Many people go there every day. There is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. It is run by a kind woman. She has been there for a long time. There is a pet groomer next to the furniture store. They take care of dogs and cats. There is a doctor's office and a vet's office in the town. They are small, but they help the people of Johnston. There is one school called Johnston Elementary School. Children go there until they are in the fifth grade. Then they go to school in another town. The town does not have a park. But they are making a new place for people to play. It will be 2.5 acres big. People can walk their dogs and have fun there. The town is small. But it is a nice place to live.",
            "I first learned about my place on a podcast about people who go missing. I was surprised. It's very expensive to live here. Almost every apartment costs over one thousand dollars a month. My friends and I had not heard of this story. It may be because we have a hard time making ends meet. Some of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we have learned to save money. We like second-hand things, like toys and clothes from a flea market. Adulthood is not as fresh as it used to be. We might start to smoke or just get used to things being a certain way. But the flea market is always there. It smells of dusty old magazines and old furniture.\n\nThere are three thrift stores near my home. I can walk to them. There are two charity thrift stores, a library, a store with old books, and a shop with strange objects. Downtown is busy. Many cars and people are there every morning. But it is quiet in the thrift stores. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the stores are silent. It's a nice place to spend the afternoon.\n\nEvery year, the city gets busier. Many cars and people come here. It's a growing city. One of the biggest companies for online shopping and delivery is here. The city still has some problems. It reminds me of New York. People are focused on their own goals, and they do not ask many questions. You can be alone, quiet, and independent. People will leave you alone if you want. It's not like the South, where people ask about your business. Here, you can be yourself, and the city will go on with its own pace, like the ocean. \n\nI like my apartment. There are people playing music next door and singing upstairs. It's always something happening. We have a community of friends instead of just strangers living in the same building. We help each other when we need it, celebrate birthdays, and mourn when someone dies. I feel lucky to live here. I like my neighbors, and they treat me well. We clean up after ourselves and help each other. It's nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my company too. I live in a big, modern city, but it's people like my neighbors who make me feel like I haven't made a big mistake in my life.",
            "I live in a typical suburb. My neighborhood is part of a community with a homeowner's association. This group makes sure the homes are well-maintained. You will see many single-family houses with small yards. These yards have grass, pebbles, and short driveways. Some houses have two cars. The roads are in good condition. There are no potholes. Most houses are one story, but some are two stories. \n\nMy house is at the edge of the city. This area is both rural and suburban. We have a lot of space for different activities. There are community pools that anyone can use. These pools are well-maintained and locked. We also have walking trails where you can walk your dog or go for a walk alone. You do not need to go to a park to be active. The neighborhood is large, so you can walk or run around it and get exercise.\n\nMost people who live here are retired. The area is safe, and people help each other. Some middle-aged and young professionals also live here. The nearby city is big. It has a small-town feel. We have many things you need. For example, we have a mall. It is not very big, but it has what you need. It takes about 15 minutes to get to a place that is important. When you get there, you can find many stores. There are stores with good food and stores with cheap things.\n\nMy neighborhood is safe and well-maintained. We have nice things like pools and walking trails. We can easily go to a big store if we need something.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest. It is near a big city in the suburbs. My neighborhood is on the east side of the town. It is one of the areas with low income. House prices are low here. Most people rent or buy these houses. However, it is not an unattractive place. My neighbors are friendly. They say hello when I walk by.\n\nCrime rates are a little higher here than in other parts of the town. But they are still low. There have been some violent crimes in the last ten years. Some people have been hurt or killed in shootings. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting last year. But we have not been directly affected by crime. Sometimes things go missing from our porch if we leave them outside.\n\nThe town I live in has a big problem. Many people have died from taking too much of a strong medicine called fentanyl. There are many programs to help people who take too much medicine. These programs include places to help people stop using drugs and training for families and friends of people who have a problem with drugs.\n\nDespite the problems, our town has many good things. My son's school is excellent. The principal, teachers, and other helpers are very good. He is happy there. The school has a positive atmosphere. No one is mean to him. We have a group of parents who help with the school. They plan many fun events. The school gives free breakfast and lunch to all students. No one has to go hungry. The town has fixed some roads and parks. But most of the improvements are in the center of the town where shops are. My neighborhood needs more improvements.\n\nI like living in this town. People are friendly. The schools are good. There are many places to shop. We have a comfortable home. We have lived here for many years and do not want to move.",
            "I live in a neighborhood with a lot of culture. My neighborhood is on a hill. It is surrounded by old buildings with important history. I live in a 7-story building across from a famous theater. A short walk away is a fun bar that is popular with people on summer nights. On weekends in June and July, people often wait in line to get in. We also have a big park nearby. The park is surrounded by concrete with tall stairs. During the cold winter months, homeless people set up tents along the sidewalk and stairs. This keeps them warm and close to a place where they can clean themselves.\n\nI love my neighborhood because of the people. We used to have problems with gangs. The government and police tried to clean up the area many years ago. The people remember. They work hard to keep their community clean. They care about what happens in their neighborhood. Some people say it's not safe for white people to walk around at night. I think this is not true. I think it's because of old ideas and fears. I am a little mixed, which might be why the people here like me. They know I understand their problems. I feel safe walking around at night and meeting new people. They are kind and helpful. For example, they stayed open late so I could charge my phone when it was raining. They saw me sitting alone and cold, and they gave me money and said I was beautiful and important.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan. It is a place where you can see farmland and small cities. There is no big city with many stores like Wal-mart or Target. If you need to go somewhere, you usually have to drive. But I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world. My town is surrounded by water. There is a big lake on one side, Lake Michigan. On the other side is Lake Charlevoix. Everywhere you go, you can find a beach where you can put your feet in the water.\n\nMy neighborhood is a small town. The houses are not stacked on top of each other. They are old homes with basements. Some of the houses have been updated and fixed up. Others are older. Many houses have yards with trampolines and playsets for kids. Some people have gardens and fences for their animals. The houses look like the kind of homes you would see in the middle of the country. People here work hard to make a living. They are raising families or have already raised families. You can see kids playing outside on any day. You can also see people walking their dogs or riding their bikes.\n\nNeighbors know each other. They can tell who belongs and who does not. If someone is grilling outside, you will see them wave. If someone is walking their dog from a few blocks away, you will see them smile and say hello. The lawns are kept neat and tidy. Nobody leaves their leaves on the ground in the fall. The grass is cut and well-manicured. If people have plants and bushes in their yards, they are trimmed and looked after.\n\nMy neighborhood is not fancy, but it is a good place to live. It is quiet and peaceful. It is safe. There are many things within walking distance. There is a police station and a jail. There is a place for recycling and a health department. We also have baseball and softball fields where you can hear the announcers calling the game. There is a small airport nearby where you can hear the sound of small planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream shop. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, which is just a few blocks away. It is a great place to live."
