            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "My home is in a bustling metropolis where diversity is the norm. Residential zones are scattered amongst commercial areas, with businesses ranging from corporate offices to local stores and eateries. There's no shortage of new eateries and shops to explore. Larger, well-known brands rub shoulders with small boutiques that line the streets, often in walking distance of otherwise peaceful neighborhoods. Parks nearby have become popular hangout spots for locals and their kids. As for the people, my neighborhood is a melting pot of cultures. Within a small radius, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a group of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Further out, there are more communities representing various ethnicities, such as Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia. While they're just a few miles away, these communities are created for ease of access to cultural experiences and support. The city's size means that even a short 10-mile drive can take hours due to traffic, especially during peak hours. Very few people walk due to the city's vastness, leading to one of the world's worst traffic conditions and a scarcity of parking spots. Conversely, there's been a construction boom with new apartment buildings springing up, which is both a draw and a source of frustration for some residents who dread the influx of more people and vehicles. Residential areas offer a range of housing options, from single-family homes to duplexes and smaller apartment buildings. My neighborhood is no exception, providing a mix of housing types and ages. While I'm not familiar with most of my neighbors, I have fond childhood memories of playing with neighboring kids.

            "My neighborhood has an interesting layout. Most of the homes are single-family, but a few have been converted into attached duplexes. My residence boasts a small front yard and a narrow driveway positioned to the left of the house. Like many others, it evokes a sense of the American dream from a bygone era, a dream that still resonates with those who live here, though the optimism has waned, and the upkeep of the yards has declined. Yet, there's still a car or two in almost every driveway, and children continue to play as if the world revolves around them. The long-standing public school, which has been here for nearly nine decades, still stirs hope in the youth and nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, most being empty, but the basketball courts remain filled with eager players. Each home may look different, but there's a sense of unity among them. A large supermarket named \"Super A,\" owned by a prominent Yemeni family, is the only such establishment in the neighborhood. The resident population is predominantly African American, with many families having roots in the area for generations. The streets are wide and kids play football, only pausing to let the cars pass. The neighborhood once had a karate school, which closed when karate's popularity wavered, and now operates as a pharmacy due to the perception that drugs can solve everything. There's also an old movie theater that shows classic films at a discounted price, a favorite among the elders who see it as a convenient night out, minus the kids. A single expressway runs through our town, but the nearby town has the exits and entrances. Despite a youth-led petition to bring one to our town, the elders' concerns about ruining the town's charm swayed the city council against the proposal. A new high school is under construction, and we're debating on a mascot. I suggest a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin to symbolize our town's unique identity.",

But if you venture behind the dilapidated Whole Foods and walk past the hotels that only spring to life during family reunions, you'll stumble upon a thriving community.

            "The first thing you need to grasp about Portland, Oregon is its reputation for being quirky. The city's unofficial motto, found on a pizza joint and bar that serves as a music venue and strip club while occasionally pushing the boundaries, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this slogan is a reminder of the Portland from the 90s and early 2000s—a Portland that was less known and more affordable, fostering unique and creative subcultures. For others, it's an invitation to embrace Portland's embrace of the strange, where being called \"weird\" is a compliment. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the ongoing construction of condos to accommodate them, Portland remains peculiar. Being weird doesn't mean being accepting of everything but does mean accepting of things that are typically not welcomed. Weird doesn't mean we lack modern amenities and challenges; we, like the rest of the nation, source most of our goods from China. Portland offers a million ways to be weird, to be unusual, yet it also has plenty of normality—yoga classes, hipster enclaves, and business professionals. Maybe being weird just means we take all of this a bit less seriously. In my neighborhood, and many others in Portland, you'll see vibrant houses, home gardens with flowers, herbs, and vegetables, and free boxes during the summer. These free boxes are traditional cardboard boxes where people discard items, but they can also be plastic bags or boxes. They contain treasures—clothes, books, anything—perfect for the lucky passerby. The mystery of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is about to me, but I'm just one variety of weird among countless others. Some residents I live with would never pick clothes from a sidewalk box. They prefer goat yoga (yes, yoga with real goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is filled with people who love all sorts of things and pursue their dreams, or at least dream about pursuing them while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland faces a drug problem. Such issues often stem from mental health struggles, and the constant rain and gloomy skies may contribute to this. Portland also grapples with homelessness, which is challenging to address due to the lack of effective solutions across the country. The non-homeless population oscillates between empathy and hostility. In this, we're quite normal.",
            "The mountains stand tall, a constant sentinel in the north, greeting the sun's rise and fall with unyielding steadfastness. No matter how much I get caught up in life or forget about them, they are ever-present, unaffected by life's ups and downs. On days when I am most stressed, their silent strength calls out to me, offering solace and renewed resolve. I first moved here for my undergrad, and the mountains became my earliest fascination. Though the university has its own beauty, with stunning buildings, ponds, and trees, it's the mountains that hold my heart. The town itself is a mix of charming cafes and a bustling downtown area, where the energy of a city meets the serenity of a small town. This blend creates a unique atmosphere, as if the city is inviting exploration. Here, I've created memorable moments—from late-night chats with friends in the park to movie nights in the university’s fancy theater. Yet, it also holds harsh memories, as all places do. The ponds, particularly, have been a place of reflection and tears, especially during existential crises. Watching the wildlife live out their roles has made me question my own purpose, a struggle I have more experience with. I've walked past these reflective spots, through the park and suburban houses, until I reached a main street. With the sun shining on palm trees, I realized I was heading north. As the sun painted the sky, I saw the mountains, strong and stoic, guiding me with their silent strength. They stirred within me a sense of perseverance.",
            "If you are planning a visit to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you won't have trouble finding it! Public transportation is easily accessible and is one of the primary ways people travel in New York City. Bensonhurst is quite urban, so you'll still feel like you're in the heart of the city. Keep an eye out for the many Asian stores you'll see during your visit. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurst has seen a significant increase in its Asian population, with Asian-owned businesses such as supermarkets and laundromats on nearly every block. Locals appreciate the high-quality food and lower prices, and the convenience makes it a popular choice. In fact, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of each other near my place. Despite the prevalence of Asian businesses, Bensonhurst is diverse, with immigrants and their children making up a significant part of the population. Additionally, the neighborhood has a recently renovated park with numerous sports facilities, swings, and a playground, catering to various ages and preferences.\n\nWhile Bensonhurst isn't overrun with corporate buildings, it has co-op living spaces and condominium apartments. Most residents live in two-family houses, and while people are generally nice, noise can be an issue. Blasting music from cars and aggressive driving are common, which can make it challenging to get a good night's sleep. While Bensonhurst is relatively safe, it's important to stay alert, especially at night. There can be unpredictable individuals, including bullies and thieves. I've experienced physical assault and package theft in the past, and while it's not common anymore, it's good to be cautious. New York City has laws against leaving dog waste, but these rules aren't always followed here. In the morning, you might encounter dog waste on your way to the train station or supermarket. It's crucial to keep your shoes clean, as this can be quite bothersome.\n\nIn summary, Bensonhurst offers a mix of Asian and diverse communities with convenient shopping options and a well-equipped park. However, noise and occasional incidents of theft and littering are drawbacks to be aware of during your visit.",
            "The sidewalks around my neighborhood are scarce, with my house perched right at the top of the steepest hill. Joggers fondly refer to it as the \"work out hill,\" but the lack of sidewalks means everyone walks on the road, which can be quite treacherous. The road is filled with potholes and the sight of telephone and electric wires strung up in a tattered state. We get heavy rainfall and storms frequently here, which often brings down branches and debris, leaving the wires looking worn and patched. Towering evergreen trees surround the area, but they're not popular with the locals who try to cut them down as they obstruct the view of the ocean. Many homes are built high up on the hill with large glass-fronted second stories to take advantage of the view. At sunset, the water seems to glow from below, and the sky turns a beautiful orange. However, the weather is often overcast and damp, with moss growing on practically everything, including my car which turned green and furry after being left in my driveway for a month. There are more dogs than children in the neighborhood, and many of the people are older, with retirees making up a significant portion. Instead of kids, people have pets. Rabbits also run wild in the area, digging up gardens and burrowing in lawns, much to the delight of my cats. We also have an array of birds, from small sparrows and hummingbirds to occasional hawks or eagles that are usually chased off by neighborhood crows. There are no stores nearby, but a short hike down to the waterfront has a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. The beach isn't particularly big, but the rocks along the shore are enjoyable to toss into the water. The bay is quite narrow, allowing you to see the opposite shoreline clearly through the mist on most days.",
            "I reside in a typical suburban setting of a small southern town in Tennessee. Our street serves as a connector between two state highways, which leads to a bit more traffic than I'd prefer, but otherwise, it's a quiet neighborhood. The influx of new residents is minimal, so I've grown accustomed to most of my neighbors. They usually keep busy with yard work and daily chores. In the winter, we hit the slopes on our side street. Our home is situated at the corner, allowing us to observe everyone coming and going throughout the day. We're accustomed to the vehicles that frequent our street; any strange ones catch our attention. Some neighbors take leisurely walks or walk their dogs. Kids ride their bikes, and it's all quite typical. We work from home, so we're often seen around the neighborhood. There are four of us in the family: myself, my wife, and our two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen. People are familiar with us coming and going, and we often engage in outdoor activities, even in the rain. On occasion, we enjoy grilling on our back deck, with the pleasant aroma of the barbecue filling the air. The lawn mowers are a constant presence from March through October, the grass growing season. The neighborhood is quite wooded, providing ample shade, but it means regular leaf raking and burning in the fall, which I find enjoyable. Winter has been mild, extending the fall season. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we seldom use the front door unless someone knocks, which is infrequent. I often work in the garage, tinkering with my truck or other projects, feeling more connected to the neighborhood when the garage door is open. Holidays like Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, and Christmas see extra visitors, with additional cars parked around the neighborhood. Overall, I appreciate living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be ideal.",
            "My neighborhood is smack dab in the middle of the high desert, a place where dirt, dirt, and more dirt reign supreme. Unless you've lived here, it's hard to comprehend the constant sight of brown landscapes, and even when you see a lawn, you know its owner is spending a fortune on lawn care. Back in the 90s, this place was dotted with houses scattered far and wide; now, it's still the same, but with many new additions. It's slowly transforming into a city, with its friendly and not-so-friendly aspects. I'm surrounded by senior citizens who make this neighborhood feel like a pleasant place to live. The stores here are mostly chains, like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final, with very few local or upscale options. The most common jobs here are in construction, as this city is still largely undeveloped and open for building. This makes me a bit nervous, as I prefer this place the way it is. I left the big city and I'm not eager to return. My job, as a drywall and T-bar installer, is in this field. I love the diverse wildlife here. People visit for the stark beauty of the desert and the challenging ecosystems it creates. Learning about the non-human residents who share this environment is crucial for safe coexistence. My family has embraced this wildlife; my three children are fascinated by lizards and desert bugs. Attractions include the annual San Bernardino County Fair in Victorville and the snow-covered mountains in nearby Wrightwood, which offer a unique desert experience. The Victor Valley Museum showcases the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem, with geological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical items telling the story of Victorville's development.",
            "I'd say my neighborhood is a bit unique compared to what others might be used to. While others might be describing their own homes and immediate surroundings, I'm talking about the college campus where I reside. The people living in my dormitory are my community, and the campus grounds are my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser degree. Despite this, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with traditional ones, such as having houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's dive into the \"houses\" in my neighborhood first. To start, there are three types of housing here: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory houses. Apartments house between 2-4 people per room, each floor has about 4-6 rooms, with the most common buildings having 2 floors, accommodating around 20 people per building. Actual houses are usually 2-4 bedrooms and are rented by school affiliates, but they're less common. Lastly, dorm rooms are the norm, with 100s of students living here, each room usually housing 2 people, with the exception of some. Moving on to the people, my school's diversity is reflected in my neighborhood. We have people of all cultures and ages. Professionals like staff live in affiliate houses, newer students in dorms, and older students in apartments. Discussing the people in depth would be unfair, so let's move on to the stores and parks. My school is a self-contained neighborhood, boasting a variety of stores and a single park. The stores offer dining options and the school's unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. Need anything? It's within reach! The park is a playground for all and kept clean and safe by the neighborhood's members.",
            "I've been living in this neighborhood for nearly a decade now, and I've got a story or two to share. Initially, moving from Riverdale to Stockbridge wasn't easy. I was devastated, missing the familiar faces and places, but my parents had our best interests at heart, so we moved for better housing and a top-notch high school. Over time, I made new friends and some new acquaintances too, but the ones who stand out are Mr. Glen and his family, and Dennis, our neighbors. They've become like family to me, and I truly appreciate their company. I remember attending Mr. Glen's re-marriage - an enjoyable event where I caught Ms. Veda's bouquet strap! I wish I'd caught the flowers too. Dancing the night away with Marsharii, his daughter, was a blast. I haven't seen her since, but I hope she's doing well. This neighborhood is a bit of a maze, but with GPS, I can explore more. I've hung out with friends Kason and Curtis, playing video games and enjoying life to the fullest. Sometimes, I just head to the park for some peace and tranquility. I'll practice my balancing tricks with sticks from Home Depot and bring my bokken wooden sword for fun. There's a basketball and tennis court too, though I haven't played in a while. My dad and Mr. Graves used to toughen us up with tennis; we always had a great time, even if it was challenging. This neighborhood has plenty of great memories, and I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood's close to the college I attend, so I enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are a fun, affordable spot. One bar just got a new name; it's pricier but the service and drinks are decent. Most locals are either college kids or lower income, given the cheaper rent. Kids are nearby since there's an elementary school close by. I don't know my neighbors, and they're quite the smokers, which led management to put an air freshener near their door, a funny but almost insulting move. The buildings around me are old but have been renovated. Down the street, there are newly built apartments, but their quality isn't great, despite the expensive rent. Across from a cheap, paper-plate restaurant and a questionable gas station, the area's improved thanks to city money. Trees surround my apartment complex, with a few stumps, but more trees than the road behind. My street, 42nd, is nicer than 43rd, which has falling apart sidewalks and shabby buildings. Crime's happened around here, and some neighboring apartments have a transient population. But I like it; it's affordable and convenient. The university is nearby, and there are two bus stops for easy shopping and downtown trips.",
            "My neighborhood is comprised of duplexes on a cul-de-sac, scattered in such a way that they resemble individual houses. Every home is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs, and almost everyone knows each other. We often gather at the end of a not-so-planned driveway, chatting while the neighborhood kids play with their toys, sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. It's incredibly refreshing, a stark contrast to our modern, tech-filled world. We're surrounded by fields and trees, enhanced by a clear blue sky and fluffy white clouds. The only bummer? This season has brought tornado warnings, and last night we heard the sirens for the first time. I found myself in my bathtub with my smallest dog, some pillows, and my purse. My bigger dog refused to join us and stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The neighborhood was eerily quiet except for the sound of heavy hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road was steaming from the temperature change, dropping from 92 degrees to 75 in minutes. The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement. As I looked up, the sky cleared and it started to rain, revealing a double rainbow. I rushed inside, grabbed my camera, and snapped photos to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were as awestruck as I was. The streets remained quiet for an hour before some people started to return home. Then it was back to normal, with moms and kids playing outside while dinner cooked. It's a welcoming neighborhood for this gal who's newly moved from NH to NC. I have a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, as do my neighbors. Despite the uniformity on the outside, the interiors vary greatly in size. Some are incredibly small, which doesn't make sense to me. I enjoy taking leisurely walks along the biggest field behind my home and heading down to the non-swimmable pond. I've spotted deer there, and in the morning, you can hear a massive bullfrog serenading. It's a fantastic place to live, just a forty-minute drive from Charlotte. Each morning is greeted by the sound of roosters crowing from nearby farms. It's like living in a small, self-contained community. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that brays in the evening to announce his presence. I'm fortunate to have found such a gem of a neighborhood.",
            "I arrived in this neighborhood on the cusp of starting eighth grade. Initially, making friends was challenging, but I soon became close with someone living two houses down and another guy on my street. Though they no longer reside here, the memories remain. Many of the original residents are still around, so it feels like home. Our neighborhood is quite typical of an American suburb, complete with two-story houses. Weekends and warm days are filled with the sound of kids playing outside. Weekdays are quieter, and I've never encountered any issues with my neighbors. I trust them enough to leave packages on my porch without fear of theft. A park just a minute or two away holds many memories of basketball, football, and baseball games with the neighborhood kids. One of my fondest memories is playing football there, though I did suffer a nose injury from an elbow. The park now serves as a place for me to spend time with my cousin's young kids, who love playing on the swings and slides. The park brings back feelings of nostalgia. Diversity is abundant in our neighborhood, with a plethora of restaurants within a mile radius. You can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian cuisine. Many folks use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for delivery. Fast food and pizza places are also plentiful, as they are in most suburban neighborhoods. The stores here have everything you could need, including a variety of dry cleaners, Walgreens, CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store. There's even an Indian-owned store for those craving homemade or ready-made Indian food. Overall, I'm grateful for our neighborhood, especially when I read about the challenges other people face with their neighbors on social media and in the news.",
            "My hometown, Johnston in South Carolina, is a charming little place that's not much different from others in the area, but it's got a significant role in the state's agriculture sector. It's proudly known as the Peach Capital of the World, a title it boasts on its welcoming sign. The landscape is dominated by farmland, either filled with peach trees or cattle. Houses are spaced out, usually two-story structures with either metal roofs to withstand the scorching heat or gray shingles. These homes are often located away from the road, allowing the front fields to be used for farming or livestock. In the heart of town, there's a single stoplight at the four-way intersection where the only stores are located. There are three \"fast food\" options: Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family; Fiesta Mexican Restaurant; and Gary's, a small burger chain. A pizzeria closed down recently. There's also Maxwell and Halford Drug, a small family-owned pharmacy that's famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola. The Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, is the only grocery store, but many residents prefer to shop at a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for most of their groceries. Dollar General is the most popular store, bustling from opening to closing time. Possibilities Furniture & More is a small furniture store run by a well-known community member. Attached to it is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, where you can find daycare, boarding, grooming, and other pet care services. Both a doctor's and a veterinary practice are located away from the main part of town, both are small but well-equipped to serve the town's residents. Johnston Elementary School is the only school in town, but once students reach fifth grade, they must attend middle and high school in the next town over. There are no parks, but a 2.5-acre recreational area is in the works to provide families with more outing opportunities and attract visitors. Despite the lack of entertainment options like movie theaters, bowling alleys, or playgrounds, it's a nice town, so small you can pass through without noticing in the blink of an eye!",
            "The first time I heard about my place, it was while listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a bit surprising, given that the rent here is over a thousand dollars a month. None of my friends or I had any idea about this, so maybe it's just the struggle we're in. I know some friends cry themselves to sleep at night because of the cost. We've learned to be frugal over the years. You start to appreciate the unique smell of flea market toys and used clothes. The adult world is full of that dusty smell. Some people might take up smoking, or they might just get used to the way things are. But the flea market is always there. It's a place where you can spend an afternoon and hear nothing but silence. There are three thrift stores within walking distance, and you can also find a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop if you walk a little farther. Downtown is bustling with people and cars every morning, but it's surprisingly quiet in the thrift stores. It reminders me of New York. Everyone's on their own agenda, and no one asks much of you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and no one will bother you. It's not like the South, where just being polite means you care. You don't pry into other people's lives here. You can keep to yourself as much as you like, and the city will continue on just fine. It's a lively place to be. The pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs make sure of that. We have a sense of community here, helping each other out when we need it. I've made some great neighbors, and they're kind enough to leave me food and help with my mail. I even like most of them. It's not just a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl; it's the people that make it feel like a home.",
            "The region where I live can be considered your run-of-the-mill cookie-cutter suburb. The presence of a homeowner's association is very noticeable. As you enter, you'll encounter nothing but well-groomed single-family homes, which the HOA can take credit for. Front yards are standardized with small patches of grass, pebbles, and short driveways, and occasional small trees. Every home boasts a two-car garage. As you drive through the neighborhood, you'll notice newly paved roads that are well-maintained and free of any potholes. Although there are varying home types, most are single-story, with the occasional two-story house. We don't have the typical mailbox setup for single-family homes. Instead, there's a centralized mailbox system at the end of the street, with everyone using keys to access their specific mailbox. There are two larger lockers for packages, and again, this is thanks to the HOA's obsession with uniformity. My house is located on the outskirts of the nearby city, making our neighborhood a blend of rural and suburban. This gives us ample space for everything from community pools to walking trails. The area is primarily retired folks, but there are also a few middle-aged and young professionals. The city, while large in population, has a small-town feel. It offers most of the amenities you'd expect, including a single mall, which is not huge but gets the job done. It takes around 15 minutes to drive to any significant place, where you'll find a variety of stores, from high-end grocery stores offering organic food to bargain outlets with minimal staff to keep costs down. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical, with plenty of nice things like pools and walking trails. You might have to drive a bit to get to significant stores, but it's not a problem when you can access all major chains by car.",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that's just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, located on the east side, is the most economically disadvantaged part of the town. Property values are low, with most houses either rented to or owned by low-income individuals. Despite this, it's not an unpleasant place. Neighbors are generally friendly, often smiling and saying hello as I walk down the street. Crime rates are a bit higher than other parts of town, but they're still generally low. In the past decade, there have been a few violent crimes within a few blocks of my home, including shootings and at least one homicide. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a nearby bar last year. Our family hasn't been directly affected by crime, except for occasional items disappearing from our porch if we forget to bring them in. The town has been significantly impacted by the \"opioid epidemic,\" with many lives lost to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are resources to combat this, such as addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected. Despite these challenges, the town has many positive aspects. My son's elementary school is excellent, with a positive atmosphere that makes it a great place for him, even with special needs. The PTO plans various events to promote family involvement and education. Over 20% of the town's population lives below the poverty line, so the school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students. No child or family is treated poorly due to their financial situation, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are reasonable. The City Council has made improvements to the town's appearance, like repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing parks, but most of these improvements are on the west side and center of town, where most shopping areas are located. This has left the east side, where I live, neglected, which is a point of contention among my neighbors. Overall, I enjoy living here. People are friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options, and our home, while not valuable, is comfortable and satisfying. We've lived here for over 16 years and can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is rich with culture, nestled on a hill surrounded by historic buildings. I reside in a 7-story apartment across from an old live theater, while just a block down, a unique arcade bar draws diverse crowds on warm summer evenings, often creating long lines, especially during June and July. A few blocks away lies a sizable city park, encircled by concrete and tall stairs, which provide shelter for homeless individuals during the cold winter months. The rain, despite the lack of snow, can be harsh, making it challenging to stay warm. They've learned to huddle together around the city center, close to a family center where they can bathe and shower, all within walking distance.\n\nWhat I cherish about my neighborhood isn't the architectural beauty but the people's spirit. Hilltop was once notorious for gang violence, and echoes of those times still linger. The people here work hard to keep their streets clean, despite the neighborhood's rough reputation. They've passed down stories from generation to generation, even to newcomers like me, about the federal officials and the DEA sweeping through the streets.\n\nThe sense of community is palpable. Despite the warnings to avoid the Hill at night due to its racial undertones, I feel a deep connection. It's amazing how I've found people who are quick to offer help rather than harm. They've shown me kindness in unexpected moments, from accepting the help of a laundromat owner to having a stranger offer me $5 on a dreary night.\n\nThis place is more than just a home; it's a testament to people's resilience and the power of community. It's a place where I feel truly alive.",
            "I hail from the heart of Rural America, nestled in the peaceful small town of Michigan. Our town is a charming blend of farmland and quaint tourist cities, but you won't find any big city malls or chain stores like Wal-mart, Target, or Applebee’s. Everything requires a bit of a drive, but the effort is worth it for the breathtaking landscapes. We are surrounded by water, with Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix as our neighbors, offering plenty of beaches for a quick dip. Our neighborhood embodies the essence of small-town living. Houses are not crammed together but spread out, each with its own unique charm. Most homes have full basements visible from the road, and while some are modernized, others carry the charm of older architecture. Aluminum siding adorns many structures, with yards featuring trampolines, play sets, gardens, and fences for pets. Our neighbors are hardworking folks, either raising families or having raised them, and the community is close-knit. You'll see kids playing, dog walkers, and cyclists or rollerbladers. Neighbors greet one another, and lawns are well-maintained, free from fall leaves and with green grass kept under control. This isn't a neighborhood you drive into and are impressed by the homes' beauty, but one where you feel safe and comfortable. The local sheriff's department and jail are within walking distance, as is the health department, recycling center, and baseball and softball fields. The small-town airport is nearby, offering the sound of small planes taking off and landing. You can walk to the local ice cream shop, and even ride your bike to the park a few blocks away. It's peaceful, safe, and exceptional for its representation of a place where you can call home."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

Residential zones are scattered amongst commercial areas, with businesses ranging from corporate offices to local stores and eateries. There's no shortage of new eateries and shops to explore. Larger, well-known brands rub shoulders with small boutiques that line the streets, often in walking distance of otherwise peaceful neighborhoods. Parks nearby have become popular hangout spots for locals and their kids. As for the people, my neighborhood is a melting pot of cultures. Within a small radius, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a group of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Further out, there are more communities representing various ethnicities, such as Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia. While they're just a few miles away, these communities are created for ease of access to cultural experiences and support. The city's size means that even a short 10-mile drive can take hours due to traffic, especially during peak hours. Very few people walk due to the city's vastness, leading to one of the world's worst traffic conditions and a scarcity of parking spots. Conversely, there's been a construction boom with new apartment buildings springing up, which is both a draw and a source of frustration for some residents who dread the influx of more people and vehicles. Residential areas offer a range of housing options, from single-family homes to duplexes and smaller apartment buildings. My neighborhood is no exception, providing a mix of housing types and ages. While I'm not familiar with most of my neighbors, I have fond childhood memories of playing with neighboring kids. It isn't a close-knit community anymore, but it was once a lively place for neighborhood playtime.",
            "My neighborhood has an interesting layout. Most of the homes are single-family, but a few have been converted into attached duplexes. My residence boasts a small front yard and a narrow driveway positioned to the left of the house. Like many others, it evokes a sense of the American dream from a bygone era, a dream that still resonates with those who live here, though the optimism has waned, and the upkeep of the yards has declined. Yet, there's still a car or two in almost every driveway, and children continue to play as if the world revolves around them. The long-standing public school, which has been here for nearly nine decades, still stirs hope in the youth and nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, most being empty, but the basketball courts remain filled with eager players. Each home may look different, but there's a sense of unity among them. A large supermarket named \"Super A,\" owned by a prominent Yemeni family, is the only such establishment in the neighborhood. The resident population is predominantly African American, with many families having roots in the area for generations. The streets are wide and kids play football, only pausing to let the cars pass. The neighborhood once had a karate school, which closed when karate's popularity wavered, and now operates as a pharmacy due to the perception that drugs can solve everything. There's also an old movie theater that shows classic films at a discounted price, a favorite among the elders who see it as a convenient night out, minus the kids. A single expressway runs through our town, but the nearby town has the exits and entrances. Despite a youth-led petition to bring one to our town, the elders' concerns about ruining the town's charm swayed the city council against the proposal. A new high school is under construction, and we're debating on a mascot. I suggest a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin to symbolize our town's unique identity.",
            "You might miss it by the looks of it - a residential area tucked behind a shopping strip, far from where one might expect to live. But if you venture behind the dilapidated Whole Foods and walk past the hotels that only spring to life during family reunions, you'll stumble upon a thriving community. Hidden within these neighborhoods, a few apartment complexes stand side by side, much like Russian nesting dolls that have been carefully disassembled and arranged in a row. The first ones you encounter may not paint a good picture, but the ones beside them and the ones after that reveal a different story. Across from these complexes, you'll find a community college's satellite campus, a quiet, peaceful oasis where students start their days with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning. The iron gates creak open to admit them, often causing commuters to shake their fists and groan at the traffic delays. The road intersects with another residential street, housing a park and a rehabilitation center for those who have suffered unfortunate bone injuries. The center boasts cheerful porch furniture and a lazy ceiling fan that sweeps the warm summer air back and forth. Children race and play in the grass, bees buzz in the flower patches, and retirees walk their dogs, scowling at skateboarding teens and nodding to the girls gathered by the playground. Nearby, a sushi place in a strip mall offers affordable food, a sports store, and a nail salon. You could fill your pool while getting a manicure and enjoying hibachi chicken - the convenience of a strip mall. A DIY frozen yogurt shop serves up cold, sweet treats for the teens who flock to the park, clutching their toppings-covered cups as they perform tricks on their skateboards and vape. This neighborhood is a slice of Americana, a piece of history in the sleepy south where time seems to stand still.",
            "“Where are we?” she asked as we drove past the seemingly endless fields of corn. “This is the countryside!” I exclaimed, knowing she’d be stunned by the vast openness. She hailed from a town where the grocery store was a short walk from her home—she’d never seen so much open space before. Surprised by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what life was like growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood who I was and where I came from. As we drove down a narrow country road, you'll find a quarry filled with water. Just beyond it lies the small development where I live. The homes are mostly brick and stucco, each with at least half an acre of land, which everyone takes pride in maintaining. Come spring, the landscape bursts with flowers and trees that change with the seasons. The driveways are filled with high-end Mercedes-Benz luxury cars gleaming in the midday sun after a thorough car wash. Continuing along the road to my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outdoors with a cheerful smile. He spends his days mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over the hum of his John Deere Zero Turn mower. The locals find him amusing, but he’s always genuine and has an incredible personal history. Now older, he’s lost some of his wit, and in his past, he was a doctor. He blends in with the grass and his mower, always tending to his lawn. Finally, you'll reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. In the back, a small stream feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream’s gentle flow, and the occasional “moo” from nearby farms. Across a handmade wooden bridge is a pristine oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. It’s where I spent most of my childhood, from building tree forts to ‘hunting’ (mostly chasing) animals, and there was always something to do and a neighborhood kid to play with. The winters in my small town can be harsh, yet they’re breathtaking. The green landscape transforms into a barren wilderness, and the vibrantly colored trees become bare skeletons of bark. After an occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. My backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister and snowmen. My sister and I fought often as kids, and snowballs were our weapons of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to store our arsenal, usually with branches. In our own little wonderland, we played pretend, carefree and innocent.",
            "The first thing you need to grasp about Portland, Oregon is its reputation for being quirky. The city's unofficial motto, found on a pizza joint and bar that serves as a music venue and strip club while occasionally pushing the boundaries, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this slogan is a reminder of the Portland from the 90s and early 2000s—a Portland that was less known and more affordable, fostering unique and creative subcultures. For others, it's an invitation to embrace Portland's embrace of the strange, where being called \"weird\" is a compliment. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the ongoing construction of condos to accommodate them, Portland remains peculiar. Being weird doesn't mean being accepting of everything but does mean accepting of things that are typically not welcomed. Weird doesn't mean we lack modern amenities and challenges; we, like the rest of the nation, source most of our goods from China. Portland offers a million ways to be weird, to be unusual, yet it also has plenty of normality—yoga classes, hipster enclaves, and business professionals. Maybe being weird just means we take all of this a bit less seriously. In my neighborhood, and many others in Portland, you'll see vibrant houses, home gardens with flowers, herbs, and vegetables, and free boxes during the summer. These free boxes are traditional cardboard boxes where people discard items, but they can also be plastic bags or boxes. They contain treasures—clothes, books, anything—perfect for the lucky passerby. The mystery of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is about to me, but I'm just one variety of weird among countless others. Some residents I live with would never pick clothes from a sidewalk box. They prefer goat yoga (yes, yoga with real goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is filled with people who love all sorts of things and pursue their dreams, or at least dream about pursuing them while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland faces a drug problem. Such issues often stem from mental health struggles, and the constant rain and gloomy skies may contribute to this. Portland also grapples with homelessness, which is challenging to address due to the lack of effective solutions across the country. The non-homeless population oscillates between empathy and hostility. In this, we're quite normal.",
            "The mountains stand tall, a constant sentinel in the north, greeting the sun's rise and fall with unyielding steadfastness. No matter how much I get caught up in life or forget about them, they are ever-present, unaffected by life's ups and downs. On days when I am most stressed, their silent strength calls out to me, offering solace and renewed resolve. I first moved here for my undergrad, and the mountains became my earliest fascination. Though the university has its own beauty, with stunning buildings, ponds, and trees, it's the mountains that hold my heart. The town itself is a mix of charming cafes and a bustling downtown area, where the energy of a city meets the serenity of a small town. This blend creates a unique atmosphere, as if the city is inviting exploration. Here, I've created memorable moments—from late-night chats with friends in the park to movie nights in the university’s fancy theater. Yet, it also holds harsh memories, as all places do. The ponds, particularly, have been a place of reflection and tears, especially during existential crises. Watching the wildlife live out their roles has made me question my own purpose, a struggle I have more experience with. I've walked past these reflective spots, through the park and suburban houses, until I reached a main street. With the sun shining on palm trees, I realized I was heading north. As the sun painted the sky, I saw the mountains, strong and stoic, guiding me with their silent strength. They stirred within me a sense of perseverance.",
            "If you are planning a visit to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you won't have trouble finding it! Public transportation is easily accessible and is one of the primary ways people travel in New York City. Bensonhurst is quite urban, so you'll still feel like you're in the heart of the city. Keep an eye out for the many Asian stores you'll see during your visit. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurst has seen a significant increase in its Asian population, with Asian-owned businesses such as supermarkets and laundromats on nearly every block. Locals appreciate the high-quality food and lower prices, and the convenience makes it a popular choice. In fact, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of each other near my place. Despite the prevalence of Asian businesses, Bensonhurst is diverse, with immigrants and their children making up a significant part of the population. Additionally, the neighborhood has a recently renovated park with numerous sports facilities, swings, and a playground, catering to various ages and preferences.\n\nWhile Bensonhurst isn't overrun with corporate buildings, it has co-op living spaces and condominium apartments. Most residents live in two-family houses, and while people are generally nice, noise can be an issue. Blasting music from cars and aggressive driving are common, which can make it challenging to get a good night's sleep. While Bensonhurst is relatively safe, it's important to stay alert, especially at night. There can be unpredictable individuals, including bullies and thieves. I've experienced physical assault and package theft in the past, and while it's not common anymore, it's good to be cautious. New York City has laws against leaving dog waste, but these rules aren't always followed here. In the morning, you might encounter dog waste on your way to the train station or supermarket. It's crucial to keep your shoes clean, as this can be quite bothersome.\n\nIn summary, Bensonhurst offers a mix of Asian and diverse communities with convenient shopping options and a well-equipped park. However, noise and occasional incidents of theft and littering are drawbacks to be aware of during your visit.",
            "The sidewalks around my neighborhood are scarce, with my house perched right at the top of the steepest hill. Joggers fondly refer to it as the \"work out hill,\" but the lack of sidewalks means everyone walks on the road, which can be quite treacherous. The road is filled with potholes and the sight of telephone and electric wires strung up in a tattered state. We get heavy rainfall and storms frequently here, which often brings down branches and debris, leaving the wires looking worn and patched. Towering evergreen trees surround the area, but they're not popular with the locals who try to cut them down as they obstruct the view of the ocean. Many homes are built high up on the hill with large glass-fronted second stories to take advantage of the view. At sunset, the water seems to glow from below, and the sky turns a beautiful orange. However, the weather is often overcast and damp, with moss growing on practically everything, including my car which turned green and furry after being left in my driveway for a month. There are more dogs than children in the neighborhood, and many of the people are older, with retirees making up a significant portion. Instead of kids, people have pets. Rabbits also run wild in the area, digging up gardens and burrowing in lawns, much to the delight of my cats. We also have an array of birds, from small sparrows and hummingbirds to occasional hawks or eagles that are usually chased off by neighborhood crows. There are no stores nearby, but a short hike down to the waterfront has a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. The beach isn't particularly big, but the rocks along the shore are enjoyable to toss into the water. The bay is quite narrow, allowing you to see the opposite shoreline clearly through the mist on most days.",
            "I reside in a typical suburban setting of a small southern town in Tennessee. Our street serves as a connector between two state highways, which leads to a bit more traffic than I'd prefer, but otherwise, it's a quiet neighborhood. The influx of new residents is minimal, so I've grown accustomed to most of my neighbors. They usually keep busy with yard work and daily chores. In the winter, we hit the slopes on our side street. Our home is situated at the corner, allowing us to observe everyone coming and going throughout the day. We're accustomed to the vehicles that frequent our street; any strange ones catch our attention. Some neighbors take leisurely walks or walk their dogs. Kids ride their bikes, and it's all quite typical. We work from home, so we're often seen around the neighborhood. There are four of us in the family: myself, my wife, and our two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen. People are familiar with us coming and going, and we often engage in outdoor activities, even in the rain. On occasion, we enjoy grilling on our back deck, with the pleasant aroma of the barbecue filling the air. The lawn mowers are a constant presence from March through October, the grass growing season. The neighborhood is quite wooded, providing ample shade, but it means regular leaf raking and burning in the fall, which I find enjoyable. Winter has been mild, extending the fall season. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we seldom use the front door unless someone knocks, which is infrequent. I often work in the garage, tinkering with my truck or other projects, feeling more connected to the neighborhood when the garage door is open. Holidays like Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, and Christmas see extra visitors, with additional cars parked around the neighborhood. Overall, I appreciate living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be ideal.",
            "My neighborhood is smack dab in the middle of the high desert, a place where dirt, dirt, and more dirt reign supreme. Unless you've lived here, it's hard to comprehend the constant sight of brown landscapes, and even when you see a lawn, you know its owner is spending a fortune on lawn care. Back in the 90s, this place was dotted with houses scattered far and wide; now, it's still the same, but with many new additions. It's slowly transforming into a city, with its friendly and not-so-friendly aspects. I'm surrounded by senior citizens who make this neighborhood feel like a pleasant place to live. The stores here are mostly chains, like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final, with very few local or upscale options. The most common jobs here are in construction, as this city is still largely undeveloped and open for building. This makes me a bit nervous, as I prefer this place the way it is. I left the big city and I'm not eager to return. My job, as a drywall and T-bar installer, is in this field. I love the diverse wildlife here. People visit for the stark beauty of the desert and the challenging ecosystems it creates. Learning about the non-human residents who share this environment is crucial for safe coexistence. My family has embraced this wildlife; my three children are fascinated by lizards and desert bugs. Attractions include the annual San Bernardino County Fair in Victorville and the snow-covered mountains in nearby Wrightwood, which offer a unique desert experience. The Victor Valley Museum showcases the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem, with geological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical items telling the story of Victorville's development.",
            "I'd say my neighborhood is a bit unique compared to what others might be used to. While others might be describing their own homes and immediate surroundings, I'm talking about the college campus where I reside. The people living in my dormitory are my community, and the campus grounds are my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser degree. Despite this, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with traditional ones, such as having houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's dive into the \"houses\" in my neighborhood first. To start, there are three types of housing here: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory houses. Apartments house between 2-4 people per room, each floor has about 4-6 rooms, with the most common buildings having 2 floors, accommodating around 20 people per building. Actual houses are usually 2-4 bedrooms and are rented by school affiliates, but they're less common. Lastly, dorm rooms are the norm, with 100s of students living here, each room usually housing 2 people, with the exception of some. Moving on to the people, my school's diversity is reflected in my neighborhood. We have people of all cultures and ages. Professionals like staff live in affiliate houses, newer students in dorms, and older students in apartments. Discussing the people in depth would be unfair, so let's move on to the stores and parks. My school is a self-contained neighborhood, boasting a variety of stores and a single park. The stores offer dining options and the school's unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. Need anything? It's within reach! The park is a playground for all and kept clean and safe by the neighborhood's members.",
            "I've been living in this neighborhood for nearly a decade now, and I've got a story or two to share. Initially, moving from Riverdale to Stockbridge wasn't easy. I was devastated, missing the familiar faces and places, but my parents had our best interests at heart, so we moved for better housing and a top-notch high school. Over time, I made new friends and some new acquaintances too, but the ones who stand out are Mr. Glen and his family, and Dennis, our neighbors. They've become like family to me, and I truly appreciate their company. I remember attending Mr. Glen's re-marriage - an enjoyable event where I caught Ms. Veda's bouquet strap! I wish I'd caught the flowers too. Dancing the night away with Marsharii, his daughter, was a blast. I haven't seen her since, but I hope she's doing well. This neighborhood is a bit of a maze, but with GPS, I can explore more. I've hung out with friends Kason and Curtis, playing video games and enjoying life to the fullest. Sometimes, I just head to the park for some peace and tranquility. I'll practice my balancing tricks with sticks from Home Depot and bring my bokken wooden sword for fun. There's a basketball and tennis court too, though I haven't played in a while. My dad and Mr. Graves used to toughen us up with tennis; we always had a great time, even if it was challenging. This neighborhood has plenty of great memories, and I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood's close to the college I attend, so I enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are a fun, affordable spot. One bar just got a new name; it's pricier but the service and drinks are decent. Most locals are either college kids or lower income, given the cheaper rent. Kids are nearby since there's an elementary school close by. I don't know my neighbors, and they're quite the smokers, which led management to put an air freshener near their door, a funny but almost insulting move. The buildings around me are old but have been renovated. Down the street, there are newly built apartments, but their quality isn't great, despite the expensive rent. Across from a cheap, paper-plate restaurant and a questionable gas station, the area's improved thanks to city money. Trees surround my apartment complex, with a few stumps, but more trees than the road behind. My street, 42nd, is nicer than 43rd, which has falling apart sidewalks and shabby buildings. Crime's happened around here, and some neighboring apartments have a transient population. But I like it; it's affordable and convenient. The university is nearby, and there are two bus stops for easy shopping and downtown trips.",
            "My neighborhood is comprised of duplexes on a cul-de-sac, scattered in such a way that they resemble individual houses. Every home is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs, and almost everyone knows each other. We often gather at the end of a not-so-planned driveway, chatting while the neighborhood kids play with their toys, sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. It's incredibly refreshing, a stark contrast to our modern, tech-filled world. We're surrounded by fields and trees, enhanced by a clear blue sky and fluffy white clouds. The only bummer? This season has brought tornado warnings, and last night we heard the sirens for the first time. I found myself in my bathtub with my smallest dog, some pillows, and my purse. My bigger dog refused to join us and stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The neighborhood was eerily quiet except for the sound of heavy hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road was steaming from the temperature change, dropping from 92 degrees to 75 in minutes. The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement. As I looked up, the sky cleared and it started to rain, revealing a double rainbow. I rushed inside, grabbed my camera, and snapped photos to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were as awestruck as I was. The streets remained quiet for an hour before some people started to return home. Then it was back to normal, with moms and kids playing outside while dinner cooked. It's a welcoming neighborhood for this gal who's newly moved from NH to NC. I have a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, as do my neighbors. Despite the uniformity on the outside, the interiors vary greatly in size. Some are incredibly small, which doesn't make sense to me. I enjoy taking leisurely walks along the biggest field behind my home and heading down to the non-swimmable pond. I've spotted deer there, and in the morning, you can hear a massive bullfrog serenading. It's a fantastic place to live, just a forty-minute drive from Charlotte. Each morning is greeted by the sound of roosters crowing from nearby farms. It's like living in a small, self-contained community. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that brays in the evening to announce his presence. I'm fortunate to have found such a gem of a neighborhood.",
            "I arrived in this neighborhood on the cusp of starting eighth grade. Initially, making friends was challenging, but I soon became close with someone living two houses down and another guy on my street. Though they no longer reside here, the memories remain. Many of the original residents are still around, so it feels like home. Our neighborhood is quite typical of an American suburb, complete with two-story houses. Weekends and warm days are filled with the sound of kids playing outside. Weekdays are quieter, and I've never encountered any issues with my neighbors. I trust them enough to leave packages on my porch without fear of theft. A park just a minute or two away holds many memories of basketball, football, and baseball games with the neighborhood kids. One of my fondest memories is playing football there, though I did suffer a nose injury from an elbow. The park now serves as a place for me to spend time with my cousin's young kids, who love playing on the swings and slides. The park brings back feelings of nostalgia. Diversity is abundant in our neighborhood, with a plethora of restaurants within a mile radius. You can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian cuisine. Many folks use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for delivery. Fast food and pizza places are also plentiful, as they are in most suburban neighborhoods. The stores here have everything you could need, including a variety of dry cleaners, Walgreens, CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store. There's even an Indian-owned store for those craving homemade or ready-made Indian food. Overall, I'm grateful for our neighborhood, especially when I read about the challenges other people face with their neighbors on social media and in the news.",
            "My hometown, Johnston in South Carolina, is a charming little place that's not much different from others in the area, but it's got a significant role in the state's agriculture sector. It's proudly known as the Peach Capital of the World, a title it boasts on its welcoming sign. The landscape is dominated by farmland, either filled with peach trees or cattle. Houses are spaced out, usually two-story structures with either metal roofs to withstand the scorching heat or gray shingles. These homes are often located away from the road, allowing the front fields to be used for farming or livestock. In the heart of town, there's a single stoplight at the four-way intersection where the only stores are located. There are three \"fast food\" options: Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family; Fiesta Mexican Restaurant; and Gary's, a small burger chain. A pizzeria closed down recently. There's also Maxwell and Halford Drug, a small family-owned pharmacy that's famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola. The Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, is the only grocery store, but many residents prefer to shop at a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for most of their groceries. Dollar General is the most popular store, bustling from opening to closing time. Possibilities Furniture & More is a small furniture store run by a well-known community member. Attached to it is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, where you can find daycare, boarding, grooming, and other pet care services. Both a doctor's and a veterinary practice are located away from the main part of town, both are small but well-equipped to serve the town's residents. Johnston Elementary School is the only school in town, but once students reach fifth grade, they must attend middle and high school in the next town over. There are no parks, but a 2.5-acre recreational area is in the works to provide families with more outing opportunities and attract visitors. Despite the lack of entertainment options like movie theaters, bowling alleys, or playgrounds, it's a nice town, so small you can pass through without noticing in the blink of an eye!",
            "The first time I heard about my place, it was while listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a bit surprising, given that the rent here is over a thousand dollars a month. None of my friends or I had any idea about this, so maybe it's just the struggle we're in. I know some friends cry themselves to sleep at night because of the cost. We've learned to be frugal over the years. You start to appreciate the unique smell of flea market toys and used clothes. The adult world is full of that dusty smell. Some people might take up smoking, or they might just get used to the way things are. But the flea market is always there. It's a place where you can spend an afternoon and hear nothing but silence. There are three thrift stores within walking distance, and you can also find a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop if you walk a little farther. Downtown is bustling with people and cars every morning, but it's surprisingly quiet in the thrift stores. It reminders me of New York. Everyone's on their own agenda, and no one asks much of you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and no one will bother you. It's not like the South, where just being polite means you care. You don't pry into other people's lives here. You can keep to yourself as much as you like, and the city will continue on just fine. It's a lively place to be. The pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs make sure of that. We have a sense of community here, helping each other out when we need it. I've made some great neighbors, and they're kind enough to leave me food and help with my mail. I even like most of them. It's not just a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl; it's the people that make it feel like a home.",
            "The region where I live can be considered your run-of-the-mill cookie-cutter suburb. The presence of a homeowner's association is very noticeable. As you enter, you'll encounter nothing but well-groomed single-family homes, which the HOA can take credit for. Front yards are standardized with small patches of grass, pebbles, and short driveways, and occasional small trees. Every home boasts a two-car garage. As you drive through the neighborhood, you'll notice newly paved roads that are well-maintained and free of any potholes. Although there are varying home types, most are single-story, with the occasional two-story house. We don't have the typical mailbox setup for single-family homes. Instead, there's a centralized mailbox system at the end of the street, with everyone using keys to access their specific mailbox. There are two larger lockers for packages, and again, this is thanks to the HOA's obsession with uniformity. My house is located on the outskirts of the nearby city, making our neighborhood a blend of rural and suburban. This gives us ample space for everything from community pools to walking trails. The area is primarily retired folks, but there are also a few middle-aged and young professionals. The city, while large in population, has a small-town feel. It offers most of the amenities you'd expect, including a single mall, which is not huge but gets the job done. It takes around 15 minutes to drive to any significant place, where you'll find a variety of stores, from high-end grocery stores offering organic food to bargain outlets with minimal staff to keep costs down. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical, with plenty of nice things like pools and walking trails. You might have to drive a bit to get to significant stores, but it's not a problem when you can access all major chains by car.",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that's just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, located on the east side, is the most economically disadvantaged part of the town. Property values are low, with most houses either rented to or owned by low-income individuals. Despite this, it's not an unpleasant place. Neighbors are generally friendly, often smiling and saying hello as I walk down the street. Crime rates are a bit higher than other parts of town, but they're still generally low. In the past decade, there have been a few violent crimes within a few blocks of my home, including shootings and at least one homicide. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a nearby bar last year. Our family hasn't been directly affected by crime, except for occasional items disappearing from our porch if we forget to bring them in. The town has been significantly impacted by the \"opioid epidemic,\" with many lives lost to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are resources to combat this, such as addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected. Despite these challenges, the town has many positive aspects. My son's elementary school is excellent, with a positive atmosphere that makes it a great place for him, even with special needs. The PTO plans various events to promote family involvement and education. Over 20% of the town's population lives below the poverty line, so the school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students. No child or family is treated poorly due to their financial situation, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are reasonable. The City Council has made improvements to the town's appearance, like repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing parks, but most of these improvements are on the west side and center of town, where most shopping areas are located. This has left the east side, where I live, neglected, which is a point of contention among my neighbors. Overall, I enjoy living here. People are friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options, and our home, while not valuable, is comfortable and satisfying. We've lived here for over 16 years and can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is rich with culture, nestled on a hill surrounded by historic buildings. I reside in a 7-story apartment across from an old live theater, while just a block down, a unique arcade bar draws diverse crowds on warm summer evenings, often creating long lines, especially during June and July. A few blocks away lies a sizable city park, encircled by concrete and tall stairs, which provide shelter for homeless individuals during the cold winter months. The rain, despite the lack of snow, can be harsh, making it challenging to stay warm. They've learned to huddle together around the city center, close to a family center where they can bathe and shower, all within walking distance.\n\nWhat I cherish about my neighborhood isn't the architectural beauty but the people's spirit. Hilltop was once notorious for gang violence, and echoes of those times still linger. The people here work hard to keep their streets clean, despite the neighborhood's rough reputation. They've passed down stories from generation to generation, even to newcomers like me, about the federal officials and the DEA sweeping through the streets.\n\nThe sense of community is palpable. Despite the warnings to avoid the Hill at night due to its racial undertones, I feel a deep connection. It's amazing how I've found people who are quick to offer help rather than harm. They've shown me kindness in unexpected moments, from accepting the help of a laundromat owner to having a stranger offer me $5 on a dreary night.\n\nThis place is more than just a home; it's a testament to people's resilience and the power of community. It's a place where I feel truly alive.",
            "I hail from the heart of Rural America, nestled in the peaceful small town of Michigan. Our town is a charming blend of farmland and quaint tourist cities, but you won't find any big city malls or chain stores like Wal-mart, Target, or Applebee’s. Everything requires a bit of a drive, but the effort is worth it for the breathtaking landscapes. We are surrounded by water, with Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix as our neighbors, offering plenty of beaches for a quick dip. Our neighborhood embodies the essence of small-town living. Houses are not crammed together but spread out, each with its own unique charm. Most homes have full basements visible from the road, and while some are modernized, others carry the charm of older architecture. Aluminum siding adorns many structures, with yards featuring trampolines, play sets, gardens, and fences for pets. Our neighbors are hardworking folks, either raising families or having raised them, and the community is close-knit. You'll see kids playing, dog walkers, and cyclists or rollerbladers. Neighbors greet one another, and lawns are well-maintained, free from fall leaves and with green grass kept under control. This isn't a neighborhood you drive into and are impressed by the homes' beauty, but one where you feel safe and comfortable. The local sheriff's department and jail are within walking distance, as is the health department, recycling center, and baseball and softball fields. The small-town airport is nearby, offering the sound of small planes taking off and landing. You can walk to the local ice cream shop, and even ride your bike to the park a few blocks away. It's peaceful, safe, and exceptional for its representation of a place where you can call home."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "My home is in a bustling metropolis where diversity is the norm. Residential zones are scattered amongst commercial areas, with businesses ranging from corporate offices to local stores and eateries. There's no shortage of new eateries and shops to explore. Larger, well-known brands rub shoulders with small boutiques that line the streets, often in walking distance of otherwise peaceful neighborhoods. Parks nearby have become popular hangout spots for locals and their kids. As for the people, my neighborhood is a melting pot of cultures. Within a small radius, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a group of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Further out, there are more communities representing various ethnicities, such as Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia. While they're just a few miles away, these communities are created for ease of access to cultural experiences and support. The city's size means that even a short 10-mile drive can take hours due to traffic, especially during peak hours. Very few people walk due to the city's vastness, leading to one of the world's worst traffic conditions and a scarcity of parking spots. Conversely, there's been a construction boom with new apartment buildings springing up, which is both a draw and a source of frustration for some residents who dread the influx of more people and vehicles. Residential areas offer a range of housing options, from single-family homes to duplexes and smaller apartment buildings. My neighborhood is no exception, providing a mix of housing types and ages. While I'm not familiar with most of my neighbors, I have fond childhood memories of playing with neighboring kids. It isn't a close-knit community anymore, but it was once a lively place for neighborhood playtime.",
            "My neighborhood has an interesting layout. Most of the homes are single-family, but a few have been converted into attached duplexes. My residence boasts a small front yard and a narrow driveway positioned to the left of the house. Like many others, it evokes a sense of the American dream from a bygone era, a dream that still resonates with those who live here, though the optimism has waned, and the upkeep of the yards has declined. Yet, there's still a car or two in almost every driveway, and children continue to play as if the world revolves around them. The long-standing public school, which has been here for nearly nine decades, still stirs hope in the youth and nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, most being empty, but the basketball courts remain filled with eager players. Each home may look different, but there's a sense of unity among them. A large supermarket named \"Super A,\" owned by a prominent Yemeni family, is the only such establishment in the neighborhood. The resident population is predominantly African American, with many families having roots in the area for generations. The streets are wide and kids play football, only pausing to let the cars pass. The neighborhood once had a karate school, which closed when karate's popularity wavered, and now operates as a pharmacy due to the perception that drugs can solve everything. There's also an old movie theater that shows classic films at a discounted price, a favorite among the elders who see it as a convenient night out, minus the kids. A single expressway runs through our town, but the nearby town has the exits and entrances. Despite a youth-led petition to bring one to our town, the elders' concerns about ruining the town's charm swayed the city council against the proposal. A new high school is under construction, and we're debating on a mascot. I suggest a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin to symbolize our town's unique identity.",
            "You might miss it by the looks of it - a residential area tucked behind a shopping strip, far from where one might expect to live. But if you venture behind the dilapidated Whole Foods and walk past the hotels that only spring to life during family reunions, you'll stumble upon a thriving community. Hidden within these neighborhoods, a few apartment complexes stand side by side, much like Russian nesting dolls that have been carefully disassembled and arranged in a row. The first ones you encounter may not paint a good picture, but the ones beside them and the ones after that reveal a different story. Across from these complexes, you'll find a community college's satellite campus, a quiet, peaceful oasis where students start their days with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning. The iron gates creak open to admit them, often causing commuters to shake their fists and groan at the traffic delays. The road intersects with another residential street, housing a park and a rehabilitation center for those who have suffered unfortunate bone injuries. The center boasts cheerful porch furniture and a lazy ceiling fan that sweeps the warm summer air back and forth. Children race and play in the grass, bees buzz in the flower patches, and retirees walk their dogs, scowling at skateboarding teens and nodding to the girls gathered by the playground. Nearby, a sushi place in a strip mall offers affordable food, a sports store, and a nail salon. You could fill your pool while getting a manicure and enjoying hibachi chicken - the convenience of a strip mall. A DIY frozen yogurt shop serves up cold, sweet treats for the teens who flock to the park, clutching their toppings-covered cups as they perform tricks on their skateboards and vape. This neighborhood is a slice of Americana, a piece of history in the sleepy south where time seems to stand still.",
            "“Where are we?” she asked as we drove past the seemingly endless fields of corn. “This is the countryside!” I exclaimed, knowing she’d be stunned by the vast openness. She hailed from a town where the grocery store was a short walk from her home—she’d never seen so much open space before. Surprised by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what life was like growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood who I was and where I came from.

            "The first thing you need to grasp about Portland, Oregon is its reputation for being quirky. The city's unofficial motto, found on a pizza joint and bar that serves as a music venue and strip club while occasionally pushing the boundaries, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this slogan is a reminder of the Portland from the 90s and early 2000s—a Portland that was less known and more affordable, fostering unique and creative subcultures. For others, it's an invitation to embrace Portland's embrace of the strange, where being called \"weird\" is a compliment. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the ongoing construction of condos to accommodate them, Portland remains peculiar. Being weird doesn't mean being accepting of everything but does mean accepting of things that are typically not welcomed. Weird doesn't mean we lack modern amenities and challenges; we, like the rest of the nation, source most of our goods from China. Portland offers a million ways to be weird, to be unusual, yet it also has plenty of normality—yoga classes, hipster enclaves, and business professionals. Maybe being weird just means we take all of this a bit less seriously. In my neighborhood, and many others in Portland, you'll see vibrant houses, home gardens with flowers, herbs, and vegetables, and free boxes during the summer. These free boxes are traditional cardboard boxes where people discard items, but they can also be plastic bags or boxes. They contain treasures—clothes, books, anything—perfect for the lucky passerby. The mystery of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is about to me, but I'm just one variety of weird among countless others. Some residents I live with would never pick clothes from a sidewalk box. They prefer goat yoga (yes, yoga with real goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is filled with people who love all sorts of things and pursue their dreams, or at least dream about pursuing them while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland faces a drug problem. Such issues often stem from mental health struggles, and the constant rain and gloomy skies may contribute to this. Portland also grapples with homelessness, which is challenging to address due to the lack of effective solutions across the country. The non-homeless population oscillates between empathy and hostility. In this, we're quite normal.",
            "The mountains stand tall, a constant sentinel in the north, greeting the sun's rise and fall with unyielding steadfastness. No matter how much I get caught up in life or forget about them, they are ever-present, unaffected by life's ups and downs. On days when I am most stressed, their silent strength calls out to me, offering solace and renewed resolve. I first moved here for my undergrad, and the mountains became my earliest fascination. Though the university has its own beauty, with stunning buildings, ponds, and trees, it's the mountains that hold my heart. The town itself is a mix of charming cafes and a bustling downtown area, where the energy of a city meets the serenity of a small town. This blend creates a unique atmosphere, as if the city is inviting exploration. Here, I've created memorable moments—from late-night chats with friends in the park to movie nights in the university’s fancy theater. Yet, it also holds harsh memories, as all places do. The ponds, particularly, have been a place of reflection and tears, especially during existential crises. Watching the wildlife live out their roles has made me question my own purpose, a struggle I have more experience with. I've walked past these reflective spots, through the park and suburban houses, until I reached a main street. With the sun shining on palm trees, I realized I was heading north. As the sun painted the sky, I saw the mountains, strong and stoic, guiding me with their silent strength. They stirred within me a sense of perseverance.",
            "If you are planning a visit to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you won't have trouble finding it! Public transportation is easily accessible and is one of the primary ways people travel in New York City. Bensonhurst is quite urban, so you'll still feel like you're in the heart of the city. Keep an eye out for the many Asian stores you'll see during your visit. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurst has seen a significant increase in its Asian population, with Asian-owned businesses such as supermarkets and laundromats on nearly every block. Locals appreciate the high-quality food and lower prices, and the convenience makes it a popular choice. In fact, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of each other near my place. Despite the prevalence of Asian businesses, Bensonhurst is diverse, with immigrants and their children making up a significant part of the population. Additionally, the neighborhood has a recently renovated park with numerous sports facilities, swings, and a playground, catering to various ages and preferences.\n\nWhile Bensonhurst isn't overrun with corporate buildings, it has co-op living spaces and condominium apartments. Most residents live in two-family houses, and while people are generally nice, noise can be an issue. Blasting music from cars and aggressive driving are common, which can make it challenging to get a good night's sleep. While Bensonhurst is relatively safe, it's important to stay alert, especially at night. There can be unpredictable individuals, including bullies and thieves. I've experienced physical assault and package theft in the past, and while it's not common anymore, it's good to be cautious. New York City has laws against leaving dog waste, but these rules aren't always followed here. In the morning, you might encounter dog waste on your way to the train station or supermarket. It's crucial to keep your shoes clean, as this can be quite bothersome.\n\nIn summary, Bensonhurst offers a mix of Asian and diverse communities with convenient shopping options and a well-equipped park. However, noise and occasional incidents of theft and littering are drawbacks to be aware of during your visit.",
            "The sidewalks around my neighborhood are scarce, with my house perched right at the top of the steepest hill. Joggers fondly refer to it as the \"work out hill,\" but the lack of sidewalks means everyone walks on the road, which can be quite treacherous. The road is filled with potholes and the sight of telephone and electric wires strung up in a tattered state. We get heavy rainfall and storms frequently here, which often brings down branches and debris, leaving the wires looking worn and patched. Towering evergreen trees surround the area, but they're not popular with the locals who try to cut them down as they obstruct the view of the ocean. Many homes are built high up on the hill with large glass-fronted second stories to take advantage of the view. At sunset, the water seems to glow from below, and the sky turns a beautiful orange. However, the weather is often overcast and damp, with moss growing on practically everything, including my car which turned green and furry after being left in my driveway for a month. There are more dogs than children in the neighborhood, and many of the people are older, with retirees making up a significant portion. Instead of kids, people have pets. Rabbits also run wild in the area, digging up gardens and burrowing in lawns, much to the delight of my cats. We also have an array of birds, from small sparrows and hummingbirds to occasional hawks or eagles that are usually chased off by neighborhood crows. There are no stores nearby, but a short hike down to the waterfront has a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. The beach isn't particularly big, but the rocks along the shore are enjoyable to toss into the water. The bay is quite narrow, allowing you to see the opposite shoreline clearly through the mist on most days.",
            "I reside in a typical suburban setting of a small southern town in Tennessee. Our street serves as a connector between two state highways, which leads to a bit more traffic than I'd prefer, but otherwise, it's a quiet neighborhood. The influx of new residents is minimal, so I've grown accustomed to most of my neighbors. They usually keep busy with yard work and daily chores. In the winter, we hit the slopes on our side street. Our home is situated at the corner, allowing us to observe everyone coming and going throughout the day. We're accustomed to the vehicles that frequent our street; any strange ones catch our attention. Some neighbors take leisurely walks or walk their dogs. Kids ride their bikes, and it's all quite typical. We work from home, so we're often seen around the neighborhood. There are four of us in the family: myself, my wife, and our two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen. People are familiar with us coming and going, and we often engage in outdoor activities, even in the rain. On occasion, we enjoy grilling on our back deck, with the pleasant aroma of the barbecue filling the air. The lawn mowers are a constant presence from March through October, the grass growing season. The neighborhood is quite wooded, providing ample shade, but it means regular leaf raking and burning in the fall, which I find enjoyable. Winter has been mild, extending the fall season. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we seldom use the front door unless someone knocks, which is infrequent. I often work in the garage, tinkering with my truck or other projects, feeling more connected to the neighborhood when the garage door is open. Holidays like Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, and Christmas see extra visitors, with additional cars parked around the neighborhood. Overall, I appreciate living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be ideal.",
            "My neighborhood is smack dab in the middle of the high desert, a place where dirt, dirt, and more dirt reign supreme. Unless you've lived here, it's hard to comprehend the constant sight of brown landscapes, and even when you see a lawn, you know its owner is spending a fortune on lawn care. Back in the 90s, this place was dotted with houses scattered far and wide; now, it's still the same, but with many new additions. It's slowly transforming into a city, with its friendly and not-so-friendly aspects. I'm surrounded by senior citizens who make this neighborhood feel like a pleasant place to live. The stores here are mostly chains, like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final, with very few local or upscale options. The most common jobs here are in construction, as this city is still largely undeveloped and open for building. This makes me a bit nervous, as I prefer this place the way it is. I left the big city and I'm not eager to return. My job, as a drywall and T-bar installer, is in this field. I love the diverse wildlife here. People visit for the stark beauty of the desert and the challenging ecosystems it creates. Learning about the non-human residents who share this environment is crucial for safe coexistence. My family has embraced this wildlife; my three children are fascinated by lizards and desert bugs. Attractions include the annual San Bernardino County Fair in Victorville and the snow-covered mountains in nearby Wrightwood, which offer a unique desert experience. The Victor Valley Museum showcases the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem, with geological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical items telling the story of Victorville's development.",
            "I'd say my neighborhood is a bit unique compared to what others might be used to. While others might be describing their own homes and immediate surroundings, I'm talking about the college campus where I reside. The people living in my dormitory are my community, and the campus grounds are my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser degree. Despite this, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with traditional ones, such as having houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's dive into the \"houses\" in my neighborhood first. To start, there are three types of housing here: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory houses. Apartments house between 2-4 people per room, each floor has about 4-6 rooms, with the most common buildings having 2 floors, accommodating around 20 people per building. Actual houses are usually 2-4 bedrooms and are rented by school affiliates, but they're less common. Lastly, dorm rooms are the norm, with 100s of students living here, each room usually housing 2 people, with the exception of some. Moving on to the people, my school's diversity is reflected in my neighborhood. We have people of all cultures and ages. Professionals like staff live in affiliate houses, newer students in dorms, and older students in apartments. Discussing the people in depth would be unfair, so let's move on to the stores and parks. My school is a self-contained neighborhood, boasting a variety of stores and a single park. The stores offer dining options and the school's unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. Need anything? It's within reach! The park is a playground for all and kept clean and safe by the neighborhood's members.",
            "I've been living in this neighborhood for nearly a decade now, and I've got a story or two to share. Initially, moving from Riverdale to Stockbridge wasn't easy. I was devastated, missing the familiar faces and places, but my parents had our best interests at heart, so we moved for better housing and a top-notch high school. Over time, I made new friends and some new acquaintances too, but the ones who stand out are Mr. Glen and his family, and Dennis, our neighbors. They've become like family to me, and I truly appreciate their company. I remember attending Mr. Glen's re-marriage - an enjoyable event where I caught Ms. Veda's bouquet strap! I wish I'd caught the flowers too. Dancing the night away with Marsharii, his daughter, was a blast. I haven't seen her since, but I hope she's doing well. This neighborhood is a bit of a maze, but with GPS, I can explore more. I've hung out with friends Kason and Curtis, playing video games and enjoying life to the fullest. Sometimes, I just head to the park for some peace and tranquility. I'll practice my balancing tricks with sticks from Home Depot and bring my bokken wooden sword for fun. There's a basketball and tennis court too, though I haven't played in a while. My dad and Mr. Graves used to toughen us up with tennis; we always had a great time, even if it was challenging. This neighborhood has plenty of great memories, and I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood's close to the college I attend, so I enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are a fun, affordable spot. One bar just got a new name; it's pricier but the service and drinks are decent. Most locals are either college kids or lower income, given the cheaper rent. Kids are nearby since there's an elementary school close by. I don't know my neighbors, and they're quite the smokers, which led management to put an air freshener near their door, a funny but almost insulting move. The buildings around me are old but have been renovated. Down the street, there are newly built apartments, but their quality isn't great, despite the expensive rent. Across from a cheap, paper-plate restaurant and a questionable gas station, the area's improved thanks to city money. Trees surround my apartment complex, with a few stumps, but more trees than the road behind. My street, 42nd, is nicer than 43rd, which has falling apart sidewalks and shabby buildings. Crime's happened around here, and some neighboring apartments have a transient population. But I like it; it's affordable and convenient. The university is nearby, and there are two bus stops for easy shopping and downtown trips.",
            "My neighborhood is comprised of duplexes on a cul-de-sac, scattered in such a way that they resemble individual houses. Every home is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs, and almost everyone knows each other. We often gather at the end of a not-so-planned driveway, chatting while the neighborhood kids play with their toys, sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. It's incredibly refreshing, a stark contrast to our modern, tech-filled world. We're surrounded by fields and trees, enhanced by a clear blue sky and fluffy white clouds. The only bummer? This season has brought tornado warnings, and last night we heard the sirens for the first time. I found myself in my bathtub with my smallest dog, some pillows, and my purse. My bigger dog refused to join us and stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The neighborhood was eerily quiet except for the sound of heavy hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road was steaming from the temperature change, dropping from 92 degrees to 75 in minutes. The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement. As I looked up, the sky cleared and it started to rain, revealing a double rainbow. I rushed inside, grabbed my camera, and snapped photos to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were as awestruck as I was. The streets remained quiet for an hour before some people started to return home. Then it was back to normal, with moms and kids playing outside while dinner cooked. It's a welcoming neighborhood for this gal who's newly moved from NH to NC. I have a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, as do my neighbors. Despite the uniformity on the outside, the interiors vary greatly in size. Some are incredibly small, which doesn't make sense to me. I enjoy taking leisurely walks along the biggest field behind my home and heading down to the non-swimmable pond. I've spotted deer there, and in the morning, you can hear a massive bullfrog serenading. It's a fantastic place to live, just a forty-minute drive from Charlotte. Each morning is greeted by the sound of roosters crowing from nearby farms. It's like living in a small, self-contained community. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that brays in the evening to announce his presence. I'm fortunate to have found such a gem of a neighborhood.",
            "I arrived in this neighborhood on the cusp of starting eighth grade. Initially, making friends was challenging, but I soon became close with someone living two houses down and another guy on my street. Though they no longer reside here, the memories remain. Many of the original residents are still around, so it feels like home. Our neighborhood is quite typical of an American suburb, complete with two-story houses. Weekends and warm days are filled with the sound of kids playing outside. Weekdays are quieter, and I've never encountered any issues with my neighbors. I trust them enough to leave packages on my porch without fear of theft. A park just a minute or two away holds many memories of basketball, football, and baseball games with the neighborhood kids. One of my fondest memories is playing football there, though I did suffer a nose injury from an elbow. The park now serves as a place for me to spend time with my cousin's young kids, who love playing on the swings and slides. The park brings back feelings of nostalgia. Diversity is abundant in our neighborhood, with a plethora of restaurants within a mile radius. You can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian cuisine. Many folks use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for delivery. Fast food and pizza places are also plentiful, as they are in most suburban neighborhoods. The stores here have everything you could need, including a variety of dry cleaners, Walgreens, CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store. There's even an Indian-owned store for those craving homemade or ready-made Indian food. Overall, I'm grateful for our neighborhood, especially when I read about the challenges other people face with their neighbors on social media and in the news.",
            "My hometown, Johnston in South Carolina, is a charming little place that's not much different from others in the area, but it's got a significant role in the state's agriculture sector. It's proudly known as the Peach Capital of the World, a title it boasts on its welcoming sign. The landscape is dominated by farmland, either filled with peach trees or cattle. Houses are spaced out, usually two-story structures with either metal roofs to withstand the scorching heat or gray shingles. These homes are often located away from the road, allowing the front fields to be used for farming or livestock. In the heart of town, there's a single stoplight at the four-way intersection where the only stores are located. There are three \"fast food\" options: Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family; Fiesta Mexican Restaurant; and Gary's, a small burger chain. A pizzeria closed down recently. There's also Maxwell and Halford Drug, a small family-owned pharmacy that's famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola. The Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, is the only grocery store, but many residents prefer to shop at a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for most of their groceries. Dollar General is the most popular store, bustling from opening to closing time. Possibilities Furniture & More is a small furniture store run by a well-known community member. Attached to it is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, where you can find daycare, boarding, grooming, and other pet care services. Both a doctor's and a veterinary practice are located away from the main part of town, both are small but well-equipped to serve the town's residents. Johnston Elementary School is the only school in town, but once students reach fifth grade, they must attend middle and high school in the next town over. There are no parks, but a 2.5-acre recreational area is in the works to provide families with more outing opportunities and attract visitors. Despite the lack of entertainment options like movie theaters, bowling alleys, or playgrounds, it's a nice town, so small you can pass through without noticing in the blink of an eye!",
            "The first time I heard about my place, it was while listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a bit surprising, given that the rent here is over a thousand dollars a month. None of my friends or I had any idea about this, so maybe it's just the struggle we're in. I know some friends cry themselves to sleep at night because of the cost. We've learned to be frugal over the years. You start to appreciate the unique smell of flea market toys and used clothes. The adult world is full of that dusty smell. Some people might take up smoking, or they might just get used to the way things are. But the flea market is always there. It's a place where you can spend an afternoon and hear nothing but silence. There are three thrift stores within walking distance, and you can also find a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop if you walk a little farther. Downtown is bustling with people and cars every morning, but it's surprisingly quiet in the thrift stores. It reminders me of New York. Everyone's on their own agenda, and no one asks much of you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and no one will bother you. It's not like the South, where just being polite means you care. You don't pry into other people's lives here. You can keep to yourself as much as you like, and the city will continue on just fine. It's a lively place to be. The pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs make sure of that. We have a sense of community here, helping each other out when we need it. I've made some great neighbors, and they're kind enough to leave me food and help with my mail. I even like most of them. It's not just a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl; it's the people that make it feel like a home.",
            "The region where I live can be considered your run-of-the-mill cookie-cutter suburb. The presence of a homeowner's association is very noticeable. As you enter, you'll encounter nothing but well-groomed single-family homes, which the HOA can take credit for. Front yards are standardized with small patches of grass, pebbles, and short driveways, and occasional small trees. Every home boasts a two-car garage. As you drive through the neighborhood, you'll notice newly paved roads that are well-maintained and free of any potholes. Although there are varying home types, most are single-story, with the occasional two-story house. We don't have the typical mailbox setup for single-family homes. Instead, there's a centralized mailbox system at the end of the street, with everyone using keys to access their specific mailbox. There are two larger lockers for packages, and again, this is thanks to the HOA's obsession with uniformity. My house is located on the outskirts of the nearby city, making our neighborhood a blend of rural and suburban. This gives us ample space for everything from community pools to walking trails. The area is primarily retired folks, but there are also a few middle-aged and young professionals. The city, while large in population, has a small-town feel. It offers most of the amenities you'd expect, including a single mall, which is not huge but gets the job done. It takes around 15 minutes to drive to any significant place, where you'll find a variety of stores, from high-end grocery stores offering organic food to bargain outlets with minimal staff to keep costs down. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical, with plenty of nice things like pools and walking trails. You might have to drive a bit to get to significant stores, but it's not a problem when you can access all major chains by car.",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that's just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, located on the east side, is the most economically disadvantaged part of the town. Property values are low, with most houses either rented to or owned by low-income individuals. Despite this, it's not an unpleasant place. Neighbors are generally friendly, often smiling and saying hello as I walk down the street. Crime rates are a bit higher than other parts of town, but they're still generally low. In the past decade, there have been a few violent crimes within a few blocks of my home, including shootings and at least one homicide. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a nearby bar last year. Our family hasn't been directly affected by crime, except for occasional items disappearing from our porch if we forget to bring them in. The town has been significantly impacted by the \"opioid epidemic,\" with many lives lost to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are resources to combat this, such as addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected. Despite these challenges, the town has many positive aspects. My son's elementary school is excellent, with a positive atmosphere that makes it a great place for him, even with special needs. The PTO plans various events to promote family involvement and education. Over 20% of the town's population lives below the poverty line, so the school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students. No child or family is treated poorly due to their financial situation, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are reasonable. The City Council has made improvements to the town's appearance, like repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing parks, but most of these improvements are on the west side and center of town, where most shopping areas are located. This has left the east side, where I live, neglected, which is a point of contention among my neighbors. Overall, I enjoy living here. People are friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options, and our home, while not valuable, is comfortable and satisfying. We've lived here for over 16 years and can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is rich with culture, nestled on a hill surrounded by historic buildings. I reside in a 7-story apartment across from an old live theater, while just a block down, a unique arcade bar draws diverse crowds on warm summer evenings, often creating long lines, especially during June and July. A few blocks away lies a sizable city park, encircled by concrete and tall stairs, which provide shelter for homeless individuals during the cold winter months. The rain, despite the lack of snow, can be harsh, making it challenging to stay warm. They've learned to huddle together around the city center, close to a family center where they can bathe and shower, all within walking distance.\n\nWhat I cherish about my neighborhood isn't the architectural beauty but the people's spirit. Hilltop was once notorious for gang violence, and echoes of those times still linger. The people here work hard to keep their streets clean, despite the neighborhood's rough reputation. They've passed down stories from generation to generation, even to newcomers like me, about the federal officials and the DEA sweeping through the streets.\n\nThe sense of community is palpable. Despite the warnings to avoid the Hill at night due to its racial undertones, I feel a deep connection. It's amazing how I've found people who are quick to offer help rather than harm. They've shown me kindness in unexpected moments, from accepting the help of a laundromat owner to having a stranger offer me $5 on a dreary night.\n\nThis place is more than just a home; it's a testament to people's resilience and the power of community. It's a place where I feel truly alive.",
            "I hail from the heart of Rural America, nestled in the peaceful small town of Michigan. Our town is a charming blend of farmland and quaint tourist cities, but you won't find any big city malls or chain stores like Wal-mart, Target, or Applebee’s. Everything requires a bit of a drive, but the effort is worth it for the breathtaking landscapes. We are surrounded by water, with Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix as our neighbors, offering plenty of beaches for a quick dip. Our neighborhood embodies the essence of small-town living. Houses are not crammed together but spread out, each with its own unique charm. Most homes have full basements visible from the road, and while some are modernized, others carry the charm of older architecture. Aluminum siding adorns many structures, with yards featuring trampolines, play sets, gardens, and fences for pets. Our neighbors are hardworking folks, either raising families or having raised them, and the community is close-knit. You'll see kids playing, dog walkers, and cyclists or rollerbladers. Neighbors greet one another, and lawns are well-maintained, free from fall leaves and with green grass kept under control. This isn't a neighborhood you drive into and are impressed by the homes' beauty, but one where you feel safe and comfortable. The local sheriff's department and jail are within walking distance, as is the health department, recycling center, and baseball and softball fields. The small-town airport is nearby, offering the sound of small planes taking off and landing. You can walk to the local ice cream shop, and even ride your bike to the park a few blocks away. It's peaceful, safe, and exceptional for its representation of a place where you can call home."
