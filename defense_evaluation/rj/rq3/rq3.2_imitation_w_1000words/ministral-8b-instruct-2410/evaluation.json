            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

So, I walk past the pond and the park, with its little houses screams of suburbia, until I reach a main street. As the sun’s rays dance atop the palm trees, painting the sky, I realize I am heading north, and there they are, as they always have been—the towering mountains, standing strong and enduring against the hazy blue and yellow sky. They speak to me silently, igniting my resolve to persevere.",
            "Visiting Bensonhurt in Brooklyn, New York, won't be a problem at all! Public transportation is abundant and widely used, making it easy to get around. Bensonhurt is an urban neighborhood, but you won't lose the energy of New York City. Expect to see numerous Asian stores throughout your visit. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has seen a significant increase in Asian inhabitants, leading to many Asian-owned businesses, particularly supermarkets and laundromats, on almost every block. Locals highly regard these businesses, thanks to their excellent quality, affordable prices, and convenience. Just near my place, there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk of each other, making grocery shopping a breeze. While Bensonhurt is predominantly Asian, it's also quite diverse, with a mix of immigrants and their American-born children. Most local businesses, large and small, are Asian-owned. Additionally, there's a recently renovated park nearby, boasting ten basketball courts, a large field for sports like soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and a water fountain. This park is a hub of diversity, where people from all walks of life play together. You won't find many corporate buildings here; instead, you'll see co-op living and condominium apartments, with many two-family houses. Most residents are friendly, but the neighborhood can be quite noisy. Cars blasting music and frequent engine revving can make sleeping difficult, especially during the day. At night, while Bensonhurt is generally safe, it's important to be cautious. While rare, incidents of trouble-making, bullying, and theft can occur. I've experienced both physical assault and package theft in the past, but these were rare occurrences. Dog waste is another common issue. Despite a fine for not cleaning up after dogs, people often ignore this rule, leaving dog waste on the streets. Be prepared to step over it and keep your shoes clean!",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live, making it a bit challenging to navigate. My house sits at the top of the steepest hill in the neighborhood, earning it the nickname \"the work out hill\" for the many joggers who run up it daily. Since there aren't any sidewalks, everyone walks on the road, which can be quite rough in places and feels a bit hazardous to drive on. The road's condition is made worse by the frequent storms and heavy rain in our area, which often cause telephone and electric wires to tatter and require constant repairs. The block is shaded by tall evergreen trees, but the locals aren't fond of them, as they often chop down as many as possible to clear their view of the ocean. Many houses are built high up on the hill with large glass-fronted second stories to enjoy the view of the bay. The sunset here is breathtaking, with the water lighting up and the sky turning orange, but the weather is often overcast and damp. Moss covers everything it can, turning my car green and furry if left outside for too long. There aren't many children around, but there's a school nearby. Most residents are older, often retired, and instead of kids, they have dogs. It's common to see them roaming around or racing through the streets. The neighborhood is also filled with wild rabbits that gardeners dislike because they damage plants and lawns. My cats love hunting them, though. We have a variety of birds, too, from small sparrows and hummingbirds to the occasional hawk or eagle, which is usually chased off by neighborhood crows. There aren't any stores nearby, but if you walk downhill to the waterfront, there are a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. The beach isn't great, but the rocky shore is fun for throwing stones into the water. The bay isn't very wide, and you can see the opposite shore through the mist most days.",
            "I live in a typical suburban area in a small southern Tennessee town. Our street connects two state highways, so we experience a bit more traffic than I'd prefer, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. Not many folks move in or out, so I've grown accustomed to most of the residents. During the day, people busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores. In the winter, we enjoy sledding down a hill on our side street. Our house is at the corner, so we see everyone coming and going. Whenever we spot an unfamiliar vehicle, we take note. Some neighbors go for walks with their dogs or just for exercise, and kids play on their bikes, as you'd expect in such a neighborhood. We're often at home because we work from our house—myself, my wife, and our two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen. That means we're quite familiar to the neighbors as well. We enjoy being outside, sometimes even in the rain, and we occasionally grill on our back deck. There's always someone cutting grass around here, with lawn mowers running nearly daily from March through October. Our neighborhood has lots of trees, remnants of the original wooded area, providing plenty of shade. Fall brings a yearly task of raking and burning leaves, and I do enjoy that smell of burning leaves. We've had a mild winter, so it feels like a long fall. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we seldom use the front door unless someone knocks on it, which is rare. I like working in the garage on my truck or other projects. With the garage doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays are quiet here, with Thanksgiving and other holidays seeing some families visiting from out of town. If it weren't for the through street, it would be ideal.",
            "My neighborhood in the high desert is right in the heart of dirt, dirt, and more dirt. If you haven't experienced it, you can't truly understand the constant brown. If you do see a lawn, you know the owner is spending a fortune on it. When I first moved here in the 90s, houses were spread out. Now, the place is still the same, but there are many new additions, making it look more like a city every day. Most people are friendly, but like any city, there are good and bad parts. I'm surrounded by friendly old folks, so I'd say it's a nice neighborhood. The shops are mostly big chains like Food for Less and Smart & Final. If you're looking for upscale stores, you'll have to travel. I don't see any Whole Foods or similar stores. The most prominent jobs here are in construction, likely because the city is still developing and there's a lot of open space. This makes me a bit uneasy; I like things the way they are now, having left a big city. My full-time job is in construction, as a drywall and T-bar installer. The desert has its own unique attractions. People visit for its stark beauty and the diverse wildlife. We've adapted well to the wildlife, with my three children obsessed with lizards and desert bugs—currently, they're outside trying to catch some. For attractions, Victorville is a great family spot. If you can, time your visit with the San Bernardino County Fair. It's a unique experience. Nearby Wrightwood offers snow-covered mountains and winter sports. If you're into natural history and culture, check out the Victor Valley Museum. It has geological, paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell Victorville's story.",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'd say my answer is pretty unique. Unlike folks who might be homeowners with their own personal lives, mine is a bit different. I see my neighborhood as the college campus I live on, and my dormitory as my community. Sure, the campus itself is a part of my neighborhood too, but it's not as intimate. Despite this, my neighborhood shares some standard features with more conventional ones: houses, people, stores, and a park. Let's start with the houses. There are three main types of housing where I live: apartments, houses, and dorms. Apartments usually have 2-4 people per room with about 4-6 rooms per floor. A typical building can house around 20 people. Actual houses are available for anyone connected to the school and usually house alumni. There are only a few of these, though, as they're less efficient than the others. Finally, the dorms are the most common, housing hundreds of students with two people per room. Now, let's talk people. My school is diverse, and that reflects in the people who call my neighborhood home. You'll find professionals living in houses, newer students in dorms, and older students in apartments. I could go on about the people, but it's hard to do them justice, so let's move on to the stores and parks. Since the school is self-contained, it has plenty of stores and a single park. The stores are like any other neighborhood's, but we've got unique clothing and grocery stores too. Everything you need is within our borders! And finally, the park is a playground for all, maintained by our diverse community.",
            "Alright, considering I've been living here for almost a decade, I suppose I can share some stuff I've learned. First off, I was really bummed when I first moved to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I'm not going to lie, I cried because I missed my old place and I loved it.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better housing location, better high school, and everything was considered “not ghetto”. Over the years, I got comfortable with it, made new friends, and even some enemies at school. I never really got to know my neighbors well, except Mr. Glen and his kids, as well as Dennis for a bit, both next door. They're great people, like family, and I appreciate them a lot. I remember when we went to Mr. Glen's wedding (they got re-married), it was awesome. I caught the bouquet, but not the flowers! We danced the night away, and I really enjoyed spending time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I hope she's doing well. The neighborhood is like a maze, but now I have a GPS, so I can explore more. I've only gone so far, like when I hung out with friends Kason and Curtis. We used to play video games a lot, and just enjoy life. Sometimes I'd go to the park and enjoy nature, which calms me down these days. I bring sticks from Home Depot and practice my balance, and if I can, my bokken wooden sword. It's fun doing what I love. There's also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven't played in a while. My dad and best friend grew up playing tennis with Mr. Graves, and we always had a blast. I guess there are plenty of fun stories, but these are what really stand out to me, and I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "Living close to my college is something I truly appreciate about my neighborhood. The area is mostly occupied by apartment buildings, along with a handful of restaurants and bars that offer fun nights out without breaking the bank. One of the bars recently changed its name and, while it's a bit pricier, the service and drinks are still decent. Most of my neighbors are either college students or from lower-income backgrounds, and the management of my building has introduced an air freshener unit near a neighbor's door who often smokes weed, which my boyfriend and I find amusing. The buildings around me are generally old but may have received interior upgrades. A bit further down the street, there are newer apartment complexes, but they look cheaply built, and the rent is high, which I find misleading. There's a budget-friendly restaurant nearby that serves most meals on paper plates and uses microwaves, and across from it is a gas station with mixed reviews. Last summer, the city invested in road reconstruction, adding a wide sidewalk, plenty of greenery, and making the area more pleasant. My apartment is surrounded by trees, although a few have been cut down, and there's a tree line behind, leading to another set of apartments. I live on 42nd Street, but right behind me is 43rd Street, which isn't as appealing. The sidewalks are in poor condition, and many buildings look shabby. While there are plenty of trees, they may be hiding the building's appearance, and some crime has occurred at the apartments on that street. My neighborhood isn't perfect, but it's affordable, and there are useful amenities nearby, like the university and bus stops, making it convenient to get to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood is a bunch of duplexes on a cul-de-sac, arranged so they look like individual houses. We're all painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Everyone here is pretty much friends, and we often hang out at the end of the driveway, chatting while the kids play. It's like stepping back in time, surrounded by fields, trees, and blue skies. The only buzzkill is the tornado warnings we've been getting. Last night, we heard the sirens and took shelter. My little dog joined me in the bathtub with some pillows, while the bigger one stayed in the living room, barking nervously. After the storm, the road was steaming hot and the hail melted instantly. Then came a double rainbow! I snapped pics to share with friends. The neighborhood was quiet, but then people started coming home and everything went back to normal, with moms and kids out as dinner cooked. It's a great place to live, with a southern accent I love, and a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment. Not all apartments are the same on the inside, but that's okay. The biggest field behind my place leads to a pond, and I've seen deer and heard frogs singing in the morning. It's like living in a small village, with a donkey on a nearby farm that brays in the evenings. I was lucky to find this peaceful neighborhood.",
            "When I transitioned into eighth grade, I found myself in a new neighborhood, which was initially a bit tough to adjust to, especially when it came to making friends. However, I eventually clicked with a couple of guys, one living two houses down and another on my street. Although they've moved away, the memories linger. The neighborhood remains much the same, with a mix of two-story homes and a lot of kid's laughter echoing on warm weekend days. Mostly quiet during the week, it’s a community where you can count on neighbors if you need a hand. I've ordered plenty of packages without any issues, which instills trust in the people around me. A park a stone’s throw from my house holds both cherished and painful recollections—from intense games of basketball, football, and baseball to the time I got elbowed in a football match. Now, I visit the park to spend time with my cousin’s kids, who find joy in simple things like swings and slides. The park evokes a sense of nostalgia. The neighborhood is wonderfully diverse, with a delightful blend of cuisines right at our doorstep—Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian, among others. These days, people often turn to apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for their meals. The neighborhood is also well-supplied with amenities—dry cleaners, drugstores like Walgreens and CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store. There's even an Indian-owned store for those who love homemade or ready-made Indian food. Overall, I’m quite fond of my neighborhood. Reading about the troubles other people face with their neighbors makes me appreciate mine even more.",
            "My neighborhood is a small, picturesque town nestled in South Carolina. While it's not remarkable, it plays a vital role in the agricultural sector. Johnston, known as the Peach Capital of the World, is proud to boast this title on its welcoming sign. The town is dominated by vast fields of peach trees and cattle. Houses are typically located in the outskirts, with many being two-story structures featuring metal or gray shingle roofs to manage the intense summer heat. These homes are usually situated away from the road, allowing the front fields to be used for farming or livestock. Within the main town, a single stoplight hangs at a four-way intersection, where the only stores are located. You can find Chinese, Mexican, and burger fast food joints, along with a small, family-owned pharmacy named Maxwell and Halford Drug, renowned for its Cherry Coca-Cola. There's also a premium grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, which is the town's only grocery option, though many residents prefer to shop at a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville. The town's most popular store is Dollar General, which sells a wide range of everyday items and stays busy from morning to night. A small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, offers deliveries, and nearby, there's Clark's Cuts and Kennels for pet grooming services. Medical care is provided by a doctor's and veterinary practice located away from the main town. Johnston has a single elementary school, but students must travel to the next town for middle and high school. There are no large parks, but the town is in the process of creating a 2.5-acre recreational area to attract visitors and residents. Despite the lack of theaters, bowling alleys, or numerous restaurants, it's a pleasant town, so small that you might miss it if you blink!",
            "I first heard about my place from a podcast featuring stories of people who'd gone missing. It was a bit surprising, considering most apartments in the area were priced over a thousand dollars a month. None of my friends knew anything about this, and I'd never heard of it either. Maybe it's the struggle. I know some of my friends find it so hard that they cry themselves to sleep at night. Life's expensive, but we've adapted to be frugal. You start appreciating the dusty smell of old flea market toys and thrifted clothes. You smell less, and you might even start smoking, or just accept things as they are. But the thrift stores always draw you in. The scent of adult life is like old magazines stacked on a closed piano, wedged into the leather and lingering even after a wash. There are three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start at the far end, you can visit two charity shops, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling, with cars and people every morning, but the stores are always quiet, even with the constant traffic. It's a peaceful place to spend an afternoon. Each year, there are more developments. Cars and people fill the city, making it a growing place. It's like New York, where everyone's focused on their goals, and no one asks for much from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where showing concern means you care. You don't pry here, and you can keep your distance as long as you like, and the city will flow like waves. It's a lively place. Between the musician next door and the vocalists upstairs, there's always some activity. In a way, it's more like a community of friends than just neighbors. We come together for birthdays, mournings, and help each other out. I'm lucky to live here. I get along well with most of my neighbors, and they treat me kindly. I make sure to clean up after myself and leave them food, and they do the same for me. I'll even bring them mail, and they do the same for me. It's nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my presence just as much as I do theirs. Despite living in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl, it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I haven't ruined my life.",
            "My neighborhood could be summed up as your garden variety cookie-cutter suburbia. The local homeowner's association makes its presence known through immaculately kept single-family homes, each with a small front yard, decorative pebbles, and a two-car garage. The streets are newly paved and free of potholes, a testament to the HOA's dedication to uniformity. Most houses are single story, but you'll find a few two-story homes scattered here and there. Mail is handed out through a communal system at the end of the street, with individual key access to mailboxes and large lockers for packages. The neighborhood is situated on the outskirts of a large city, blending rural and suburban elements. We have a lot of land to spare, with multiple community pools and walking trails for dog walks or evening strolls. The community is primarily made up of retired residents, with a smattering of middle-aged and young professionals. The city itself is large in population but retains a small-town charm. We have all the necessary amenities like a mall, grocery stores offering organic foods, and bargain outlets. Though it takes a short drive to get to significant places, there's no shortage of shopping options once you arrive. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and quite typical, with plenty of nice amenities like pools and trails. The community looks out for each other, and while we're not right next door to major shopping, a quick car ride will get you anywhere you need to go.",
            "I reside in a small Midwestern town that borders the outskirts of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, situated on the east side, is one of the most economically marginalized areas. Property values here are low, with many homes rented or owned by those of modest means. Despite this, the area is not unpleasant, with neighbors who are generally friendly and offer a warm smile when I walk by. Crime rates, while slightly higher than in other areas, are still manageable. In the past decade, a few violent crimes have occurred within a few blocks of my residence, including a couple of shootings and a single homicide. Our neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Fortunately, our family has fortunately escaped direct involvement in any crime except for the occasional disappearance of items from our porch when left unattended. The town has been significantly impacted by the “opioid epidemic,” with many lives lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Thankfully, there are numerous resources to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. While facing these challenges, my town has many positive aspects. My son’s elementary school boasts an excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite his special needs, he hasn’t faced any bullying due to the school’s positive atmosphere, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that organizes multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Given that over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. No child or family is treated as \"less than\" based on their ability to pay, and school fees, supplies, and field trip costs are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made several improvements to the town's appearance, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Most of these improvements have been concentrated in the town center and on the west side, where all shopping areas are located and most traffic passes through. The east side, where I live, tends to be overlooked, a point of contention among my neighborhood residents. Nonetheless, I genuinely enjoy living here. The people are friendly, the schools are excellent, there are sufficient shopping options, and while our home may not be worth much, it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is a cultural haven. It sits upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical significance. I reside in a 7-story apartment building directly opposite an old live theatre, and just a block away is a quaint arcade bar that draws in a diverse crowd on warm summer nights. Throughout June and July, lines of people queue up to get inside. A few blocks up is a large city park, with concrete walls and tall steps encircling it. During winter, homeless people set up tents in rows along the sidewalk and steps, staying warm by huddling close together and within walking distance of the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. The city's beauty lies not just in its historic architecture but in the people who inhabit it. Hilltop was once notorious for gang violence, and stories of federal sweeps are still passed down from generation to generation. Despite its reputation, the neighborhood has worked hard to clean up and maintain a sense of community. However, warnings about walking the Hill after dark, especially for white people, persist, echoing the past. I believe this stems from old social conditioning and is tinged with the memories of racial tensions. Yet, I feel at home here, meeting people who have shown me kindness rather than hostility. Even in the dead of night, I find warmth and acceptance. This is where I've had strangers offer me jackets and money, and where I've felt seen and valued, even on the most dreary nights.",
            "I call Rural America my home, nestled in small-town Michigan. The landscape here is a mix of farmland and tourist hotspots, with no major city malls, national retail chains, or popular restaurants in sight. Driving is essential for any destination. Yet, I live in one of the most breathtaking places, surrounded by water. Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix border my town, and beaches are never far from reach. My neighborhood embodies the essence of a small town. Houses are distinct, not uniform, and many are older, with basements visible from the road. Aluminum siding is common, and houses come in various colors. Most have yards with trampolines, playsets, or gardens. The feel is quintessential Middle America, with hardworking families raising their children. Neighbors are familiar faces, and interactions are friendly. Lawns are well-maintained, and neighbors keep their plants trimmed. It's a peaceful, quiet, and safe sanctuary where people feel secure. Within walking distance, we have the county sheriff's department, health department, recycling center, baseball fields, a small airport, and an ice cream shop. My kids can even bike to the park a few blocks away. It's a wonderful place to call home."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "My community is quite unique. Most homes here are single-family, but a few have been divided into two, still attached to each other. My house sports a small yard in front and a small driveway to the left. Like many others, it harks back to a time when living in the suburbs was the American dream, though that dream seems to be fading. Yet, my neighborhood and many others still stand, calling out to visitors that this dream is still alive, and we're holding onto it the best we can. The optimism of the past seems to be dwindling, and the maintenance of the yards has gone down, but you'll still find a car or two in every driveway, and kids playing like the world is their whole existence. Our public school, nearly a century old, still stands, inspiring today's youth while evoking nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are always bustling. While every home looks different, they feel the same. There's a large supermarket called 'Super A', owned by a prominent Yemeni family, possibly the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of residents are African American. The streets are wide, and kids usually play soccer, halting briefly to let cars pass. Many residents have been here for generations and can tell tales of a past where everyone knew everyone. A karate school once stood, but it closed when Hollywood stopped making 'Karate Kid' movies. It's now a pharmacy, as drugs, they say, make everything better. There's also an old movie theatre that shows classic films at discounted prices, favored by the elders despite the lack of recent releases. A single expressway runs through my town, with the entrance and exit in the neighboring town.

A new high school is being built, and we're debating on a town mascot. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the perfect representation of our town.",
            "You might miss it if you're not looking too closely - it's a neighborhood behind a shopping strip, not a place one typically associates with places to live. At least, not places most people would choose to reside in. But step behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods, and further behind the hotels that only see action during family reunions, you'll find a thriving community. Nestled here are several apartment complexes, lined up like Russian nesting dolls that have been carefully dismantled and reassembled beside each other down the road. The first ones you encounter have made headlines for some shady dealings, so we won't dwell too much on those - first impressions can be misleading. But the complexes beyond that, and the two alongside them, are a different story, one that very few locals are aware of. On the other side of the road, there's a community college's satellite campus - a peaceful, quiet set of buildings where students shuffle in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to start their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to let them in one by one, while commuters honk and groan from their cars, held up by the increased traffic on days with higher attendance. The road intersects with another residential street, featuring a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for those who have broken bones. The treatment center has cheerful porch furniture, and a lazy ceiling fan keeps the warm, thick air circulating. Children dart back and forth in the grass, practicing cartwheels and handstands among the prickly green stalks while bees lazily buzz around the flowers along the road. Elderly residents walk their dogs on the path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and smiling at the teenage girls gathered by the playground, chatting about boys and viral sensations. Across from them is a strip mall containing a sushi restaurant, a swimming supply store, and a nail salon tucked in between. You can fill your pool, get a manicure, and enjoy a hibachi meal all at once - the convenience of a strip mall. There's also a DIY frozen yogurt place where you'll often see teens in the park, clinging to cold, sweating cups of toppings while they perform skateboard tricks and vape, believing it to be the coolest. The neighborhood here is a slice of classic Americana - a piece of history in the slow-paced south, where change is a rare occurrence, including the passage of time.",
            "Where is everything? she asked, taking in the vast corn fields that stretched out as far as the eye could see. \"This is it!\" I exclaimed, knowing she'd be surprised at the sheer openness of the landscape. Having grown up in a town where the grocery store was just a five-minute walk from home, this was a world away for her. She was struck by the endless expanse of corn, and I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio. As we drove down a winding country road, we soon came across a water-filled quarry, and just beyond it was the quiet development where I live. The homes, mostly made of brick and stucco, each had at least half an acre of land that residents took great pride in maintaining. During spring, the yards were filled with vibrant flowers and trees that changed with the seasons. Luxury cars like Mercedes Benz gleamed in the sunlight after a good wash, and my Korean neighbor was always tending to his lawn, mowing and singing along to his favorite tunes. Despite his age and the loss of some of his youthful charm, he was a beloved figure in the neighborhood with a fascinating past—he was once a doctor. As we continued along the road, we reached my grey stucco home. Geese were abundant in the side yard, being chased by our Terrier, and out back, a small stream fed into the quarry, with bullfrogs croaking, the stream babbling, and the distant \"moo\" of nearby farm animals. Crossing the handmade wooden bridge led to an undisturbed oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was where I spent most of my childhood, building forts and \"hunting\" animals, always with neighborhood friends. winters in my small town were harsh but beautiful, turning the lush greenery into a stark, snowy wilderness. Trees shed their colorful leaves, and snow angels and snowmen appeared overnight. My sister and I would build massive igloo-like forts for our snowball arsenal, and in our wonderland, we could pretend like there was no tomorrow.",
            "First off, Portland, Oregon is infamous for its \"weird\" reputation. The city's unofficial slogan, scrawled on a building that doubles as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, and strip club, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". Some see this as a nod to the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a time when it was less known and more affordable, birthing unique and creative subcultures. To others, it's an invitation to embrace weirdness, where being different is seen as a compliment. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the constant construction of condos, Portland remains weird. Being weird here doesn't mean accepting everything, but it does mean accepting things that are usually not. Like everywhere else, we buy a lot of our stuff from China, but Portland has a unique twist. We have yoga and hipsters, business professionals, and even goat yoga (yes, yoga with real goats). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things, and many pursue their dreams or dream about doing so while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem, often stemming from mental health issues and the constant rain. It also struggles with homelessness, which isn't easy to solve. The non-homeless population is divided between care and hatred. In this, Portland is not weird at all.",
            "The peaks are constant, standing sentinel in the north, witnessing the sun’s daily journey from dawn to dusk. No matter how much I am consumed by work or life, they stand steadfast, unmoved by life’s turmoil. On days when I am most stressed and burdened, they call out to me, offering solace when I turn to them, lending me the strength to carry on, one day at a time. I first arrived here for my undergrad, and the mountains north of campus were the first to captivate me. While the university also boasts stunning sights in its buildings, ponds, and trees, it’s the mountains that hold the true throne of my admiration. The rest of the town is equally enchanting, with countless cafes serving as homes to many hours of late-night study sessions. One can take a short walk or hop on a bus to the downtown area, where the antiquated buildings and bustling restaurants create an atmosphere that mirrors the city's urban counterpart. This urban-suburban dichotomy gives the town a unique charm, beckoning exploration. Here, I’ve created many cherished memories, each tied to a specific part of town—whether it's strolling past the rusted swings in the park with friends after a long night of studying or rushing through the downtown to catch a movie in the fancy theater. Yet, amidst the joy, there are also harsh memories, as life inevitably brings them. The ponds, in particular, serve as excellent spots for reflection and tears, especially during existential crises in the wee hours. While watching the turtles, ducks, and insects live out their lives, I often ponder my own purpose in this mysterious journey called life. So, I walk past the pond and the park, with its little houses screams of suburbia, until I reach a main street. As the sun’s rays dance atop the palm trees, painting the sky, I realize I am heading north, and there they are, as they always have been—the towering mountains, standing strong and enduring against the hazy blue and yellow sky. They speak to me silently, igniting my resolve to persevere.",
            "Visiting Bensonhurt in Brooklyn, New York, won't be a problem at all! Public transportation is abundant and widely used, making it easy to get around. Bensonhurt is an urban neighborhood, but you won't lose the energy of New York City. Expect to see numerous Asian stores throughout your visit. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has seen a significant increase in Asian inhabitants, leading to many Asian-owned businesses, particularly supermarkets and laundromats, on almost every block. Locals highly regard these businesses, thanks to their excellent quality, affordable prices, and convenience. Just near my place, there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk of each other, making grocery shopping a breeze. While Bensonhurt is predominantly Asian, it's also quite diverse, with a mix of immigrants and their American-born children. Most local businesses, large and small, are Asian-owned. Additionally, there's a recently renovated park nearby, boasting ten basketball courts, a large field for sports like soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and a water fountain. This park is a hub of diversity, where people from all walks of life play together. You won't find many corporate buildings here; instead, you'll see co-op living and condominium apartments, with many two-family houses. Most residents are friendly, but the neighborhood can be quite noisy. Cars blasting music and frequent engine revving can make sleeping difficult, especially during the day. At night, while Bensonhurt is generally safe, it's important to be cautious. While rare, incidents of trouble-making, bullying, and theft can occur. I've experienced both physical assault and package theft in the past, but these were rare occurrences. Dog waste is another common issue. Despite a fine for not cleaning up after dogs, people often ignore this rule, leaving dog waste on the streets. Be prepared to step over it and keep your shoes clean!",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live, making it a bit challenging to navigate. My house sits at the top of the steepest hill in the neighborhood, earning it the nickname \"the work out hill\" for the many joggers who run up it daily. Since there aren't any sidewalks, everyone walks on the road, which can be quite rough in places and feels a bit hazardous to drive on. The road's condition is made worse by the frequent storms and heavy rain in our area, which often cause telephone and electric wires to tatter and require constant repairs. The block is shaded by tall evergreen trees, but the locals aren't fond of them, as they often chop down as many as possible to clear their view of the ocean. Many houses are built high up on the hill with large glass-fronted second stories to enjoy the view of the bay. The sunset here is breathtaking, with the water lighting up and the sky turning orange, but the weather is often overcast and damp. Moss covers everything it can, turning my car green and furry if left outside for too long. There aren't many children around, but there's a school nearby. Most residents are older, often retired, and instead of kids, they have dogs. It's common to see them roaming around or racing through the streets. The neighborhood is also filled with wild rabbits that gardeners dislike because they damage plants and lawns. My cats love hunting them, though. We have a variety of birds, too, from small sparrows and hummingbirds to the occasional hawk or eagle, which is usually chased off by neighborhood crows. There aren't any stores nearby, but if you walk downhill to the waterfront, there are a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. The beach isn't great, but the rocky shore is fun for throwing stones into the water. The bay isn't very wide, and you can see the opposite shore through the mist most days.",
            "I live in a typical suburban area in a small southern Tennessee town. Our street connects two state highways, so we experience a bit more traffic than I'd prefer, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. Not many folks move in or out, so I've grown accustomed to most of the residents. During the day, people busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores. In the winter, we enjoy sledding down a hill on our side street. Our house is at the corner, so we see everyone coming and going. Whenever we spot an unfamiliar vehicle, we take note. Some neighbors go for walks with their dogs or just for exercise, and kids play on their bikes, as you'd expect in such a neighborhood. We're often at home because we work from our house—myself, my wife, and our two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen. That means we're quite familiar to the neighbors as well. We enjoy being outside, sometimes even in the rain, and we occasionally grill on our back deck. There's always someone cutting grass around here, with lawn mowers running nearly daily from March through October. Our neighborhood has lots of trees, remnants of the original wooded area, providing plenty of shade. Fall brings a yearly task of raking and burning leaves, and I do enjoy that smell of burning leaves. We've had a mild winter, so it feels like a long fall. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we seldom use the front door unless someone knocks on it, which is rare. I like working in the garage on my truck or other projects. With the garage doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays are quiet here, with Thanksgiving and other holidays seeing some families visiting from out of town. If it weren't for the through street, it would be ideal.",
            "My neighborhood in the high desert is right in the heart of dirt, dirt, and more dirt. If you haven't experienced it, you can't truly understand the constant brown. If you do see a lawn, you know the owner is spending a fortune on it. When I first moved here in the 90s, houses were spread out. Now, the place is still the same, but there are many new additions, making it look more like a city every day. Most people are friendly, but like any city, there are good and bad parts. I'm surrounded by friendly old folks, so I'd say it's a nice neighborhood. The shops are mostly big chains like Food for Less and Smart & Final. If you're looking for upscale stores, you'll have to travel. I don't see any Whole Foods or similar stores. The most prominent jobs here are in construction, likely because the city is still developing and there's a lot of open space. This makes me a bit uneasy; I like things the way they are now, having left a big city. My full-time job is in construction, as a drywall and T-bar installer. The desert has its own unique attractions. People visit for its stark beauty and the diverse wildlife. We've adapted well to the wildlife, with my three children obsessed with lizards and desert bugs—currently, they're outside trying to catch some. For attractions, Victorville is a great family spot. If you can, time your visit with the San Bernardino County Fair. It's a unique experience. Nearby Wrightwood offers snow-covered mountains and winter sports. If you're into natural history and culture, check out the Victor Valley Museum. It has geological, paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell Victorville's story.",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'd say my answer is pretty unique. Unlike folks who might be homeowners with their own personal lives, mine is a bit different. I see my neighborhood as the college campus I live on, and my dormitory as my community. Sure, the campus itself is a part of my neighborhood too, but it's not as intimate. Despite this, my neighborhood shares some standard features with more conventional ones: houses, people, stores, and a park. Let's start with the houses. There are three main types of housing where I live: apartments, houses, and dorms. Apartments usually have 2-4 people per room with about 4-6 rooms per floor. A typical building can house around 20 people. Actual houses are available for anyone connected to the school and usually house alumni. There are only a few of these, though, as they're less efficient than the others. Finally, the dorms are the most common, housing hundreds of students with two people per room. Now, let's talk people. My school is diverse, and that reflects in the people who call my neighborhood home. You'll find professionals living in houses, newer students in dorms, and older students in apartments. I could go on about the people, but it's hard to do them justice, so let's move on to the stores and parks. Since the school is self-contained, it has plenty of stores and a single park. The stores are like any other neighborhood's, but we've got unique clothing and grocery stores too. Everything you need is within our borders! And finally, the park is a playground for all, maintained by our diverse community.",
            "Alright, considering I've been living here for almost a decade, I suppose I can share some stuff I've learned. First off, I was really bummed when I first moved to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I'm not going to lie, I cried because I missed my old place and I loved it.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better housing location, better high school, and everything was considered “not ghetto”. Over the years, I got comfortable with it, made new friends, and even some enemies at school. I never really got to know my neighbors well, except Mr. Glen and his kids, as well as Dennis for a bit, both next door. They're great people, like family, and I appreciate them a lot. I remember when we went to Mr. Glen's wedding (they got re-married), it was awesome. I caught the bouquet, but not the flowers! We danced the night away, and I really enjoyed spending time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I hope she's doing well. The neighborhood is like a maze, but now I have a GPS, so I can explore more. I've only gone so far, like when I hung out with friends Kason and Curtis. We used to play video games a lot, and just enjoy life. Sometimes I'd go to the park and enjoy nature, which calms me down these days. I bring sticks from Home Depot and practice my balance, and if I can, my bokken wooden sword. It's fun doing what I love. There's also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven't played in a while. My dad and best friend grew up playing tennis with Mr. Graves, and we always had a blast. I guess there are plenty of fun stories, but these are what really stand out to me, and I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "Living close to my college is something I truly appreciate about my neighborhood. The area is mostly occupied by apartment buildings, along with a handful of restaurants and bars that offer fun nights out without breaking the bank. One of the bars recently changed its name and, while it's a bit pricier, the service and drinks are still decent. Most of my neighbors are either college students or from lower-income backgrounds, and the management of my building has introduced an air freshener unit near a neighbor's door who often smokes weed, which my boyfriend and I find amusing. The buildings around me are generally old but may have received interior upgrades. A bit further down the street, there are newer apartment complexes, but they look cheaply built, and the rent is high, which I find misleading. There's a budget-friendly restaurant nearby that serves most meals on paper plates and uses microwaves, and across from it is a gas station with mixed reviews. Last summer, the city invested in road reconstruction, adding a wide sidewalk, plenty of greenery, and making the area more pleasant. My apartment is surrounded by trees, although a few have been cut down, and there's a tree line behind, leading to another set of apartments. I live on 42nd Street, but right behind me is 43rd Street, which isn't as appealing. The sidewalks are in poor condition, and many buildings look shabby. While there are plenty of trees, they may be hiding the building's appearance, and some crime has occurred at the apartments on that street. My neighborhood isn't perfect, but it's affordable, and there are useful amenities nearby, like the university and bus stops, making it convenient to get to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood is a bunch of duplexes on a cul-de-sac, arranged so they look like individual houses. We're all painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Everyone here is pretty much friends, and we often hang out at the end of the driveway, chatting while the kids play. It's like stepping back in time, surrounded by fields, trees, and blue skies. The only buzzkill is the tornado warnings we've been getting. Last night, we heard the sirens and took shelter. My little dog joined me in the bathtub with some pillows, while the bigger one stayed in the living room, barking nervously. After the storm, the road was steaming hot and the hail melted instantly. Then came a double rainbow! I snapped pics to share with friends. The neighborhood was quiet, but then people started coming home and everything went back to normal, with moms and kids out as dinner cooked. It's a great place to live, with a southern accent I love, and a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment. Not all apartments are the same on the inside, but that's okay. The biggest field behind my place leads to a pond, and I've seen deer and heard frogs singing in the morning. It's like living in a small village, with a donkey on a nearby farm that brays in the evenings. I was lucky to find this peaceful neighborhood.",
            "When I transitioned into eighth grade, I found myself in a new neighborhood, which was initially a bit tough to adjust to, especially when it came to making friends. However, I eventually clicked with a couple of guys, one living two houses down and another on my street. Although they've moved away, the memories linger. The neighborhood remains much the same, with a mix of two-story homes and a lot of kid's laughter echoing on warm weekend days. Mostly quiet during the week, it’s a community where you can count on neighbors if you need a hand. I've ordered plenty of packages without any issues, which instills trust in the people around me. A park a stone’s throw from my house holds both cherished and painful recollections—from intense games of basketball, football, and baseball to the time I got elbowed in a football match. Now, I visit the park to spend time with my cousin’s kids, who find joy in simple things like swings and slides. The park evokes a sense of nostalgia. The neighborhood is wonderfully diverse, with a delightful blend of cuisines right at our doorstep—Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian, among others. These days, people often turn to apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for their meals. The neighborhood is also well-supplied with amenities—dry cleaners, drugstores like Walgreens and CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store. There's even an Indian-owned store for those who love homemade or ready-made Indian food. Overall, I’m quite fond of my neighborhood. Reading about the troubles other people face with their neighbors makes me appreciate mine even more.",
            "My neighborhood is a small, picturesque town nestled in South Carolina. While it's not remarkable, it plays a vital role in the agricultural sector. Johnston, known as the Peach Capital of the World, is proud to boast this title on its welcoming sign. The town is dominated by vast fields of peach trees and cattle. Houses are typically located in the outskirts, with many being two-story structures featuring metal or gray shingle roofs to manage the intense summer heat. These homes are usually situated away from the road, allowing the front fields to be used for farming or livestock. Within the main town, a single stoplight hangs at a four-way intersection, where the only stores are located. You can find Chinese, Mexican, and burger fast food joints, along with a small, family-owned pharmacy named Maxwell and Halford Drug, renowned for its Cherry Coca-Cola. There's also a premium grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, which is the town's only grocery option, though many residents prefer to shop at a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville. The town's most popular store is Dollar General, which sells a wide range of everyday items and stays busy from morning to night. A small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, offers deliveries, and nearby, there's Clark's Cuts and Kennels for pet grooming services. Medical care is provided by a doctor's and veterinary practice located away from the main town. Johnston has a single elementary school, but students must travel to the next town for middle and high school. There are no large parks, but the town is in the process of creating a 2.5-acre recreational area to attract visitors and residents. Despite the lack of theaters, bowling alleys, or numerous restaurants, it's a pleasant town, so small that you might miss it if you blink!",
            "I first heard about my place from a podcast featuring stories of people who'd gone missing. It was a bit surprising, considering most apartments in the area were priced over a thousand dollars a month. None of my friends knew anything about this, and I'd never heard of it either. Maybe it's the struggle. I know some of my friends find it so hard that they cry themselves to sleep at night. Life's expensive, but we've adapted to be frugal. You start appreciating the dusty smell of old flea market toys and thrifted clothes. You smell less, and you might even start smoking, or just accept things as they are. But the thrift stores always draw you in. The scent of adult life is like old magazines stacked on a closed piano, wedged into the leather and lingering even after a wash. There are three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start at the far end, you can visit two charity shops, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling, with cars and people every morning, but the stores are always quiet, even with the constant traffic. It's a peaceful place to spend an afternoon. Each year, there are more developments. Cars and people fill the city, making it a growing place. It's like New York, where everyone's focused on their goals, and no one asks for much from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where showing concern means you care. You don't pry here, and you can keep your distance as long as you like, and the city will flow like waves. It's a lively place. Between the musician next door and the vocalists upstairs, there's always some activity. In a way, it's more like a community of friends than just neighbors. We come together for birthdays, mournings, and help each other out. I'm lucky to live here. I get along well with most of my neighbors, and they treat me kindly. I make sure to clean up after myself and leave them food, and they do the same for me. I'll even bring them mail, and they do the same for me. It's nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my presence just as much as I do theirs. Despite living in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl, it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I haven't ruined my life.",
            "My neighborhood could be summed up as your garden variety cookie-cutter suburbia. The local homeowner's association makes its presence known through immaculately kept single-family homes, each with a small front yard, decorative pebbles, and a two-car garage. The streets are newly paved and free of potholes, a testament to the HOA's dedication to uniformity. Most houses are single story, but you'll find a few two-story homes scattered here and there. Mail is handed out through a communal system at the end of the street, with individual key access to mailboxes and large lockers for packages. The neighborhood is situated on the outskirts of a large city, blending rural and suburban elements. We have a lot of land to spare, with multiple community pools and walking trails for dog walks or evening strolls. The community is primarily made up of retired residents, with a smattering of middle-aged and young professionals. The city itself is large in population but retains a small-town charm. We have all the necessary amenities like a mall, grocery stores offering organic foods, and bargain outlets. Though it takes a short drive to get to significant places, there's no shortage of shopping options once you arrive. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and quite typical, with plenty of nice amenities like pools and trails. The community looks out for each other, and while we're not right next door to major shopping, a quick car ride will get you anywhere you need to go.",
            "I reside in a small Midwestern town that borders the outskirts of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, situated on the east side, is one of the most economically marginalized areas. Property values here are low, with many homes rented or owned by those of modest means. Despite this, the area is not unpleasant, with neighbors who are generally friendly and offer a warm smile when I walk by. Crime rates, while slightly higher than in other areas, are still manageable. In the past decade, a few violent crimes have occurred within a few blocks of my residence, including a couple of shootings and a single homicide. Our neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Fortunately, our family has fortunately escaped direct involvement in any crime except for the occasional disappearance of items from our porch when left unattended. The town has been significantly impacted by the “opioid epidemic,” with many lives lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Thankfully, there are numerous resources to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. While facing these challenges, my town has many positive aspects. My son’s elementary school boasts an excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite his special needs, he hasn’t faced any bullying due to the school’s positive atmosphere, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that organizes multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Given that over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. No child or family is treated as \"less than\" based on their ability to pay, and school fees, supplies, and field trip costs are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made several improvements to the town's appearance, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Most of these improvements have been concentrated in the town center and on the west side, where all shopping areas are located and most traffic passes through. The east side, where I live, tends to be overlooked, a point of contention among my neighborhood residents. Nonetheless, I genuinely enjoy living here. The people are friendly, the schools are excellent, there are sufficient shopping options, and while our home may not be worth much, it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is a cultural haven. It sits upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical significance. I reside in a 7-story apartment building directly opposite an old live theatre, and just a block away is a quaint arcade bar that draws in a diverse crowd on warm summer nights. Throughout June and July, lines of people queue up to get inside. A few blocks up is a large city park, with concrete walls and tall steps encircling it. During winter, homeless people set up tents in rows along the sidewalk and steps, staying warm by huddling close together and within walking distance of the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. The city's beauty lies not just in its historic architecture but in the people who inhabit it. Hilltop was once notorious for gang violence, and stories of federal sweeps are still passed down from generation to generation. Despite its reputation, the neighborhood has worked hard to clean up and maintain a sense of community. However, warnings about walking the Hill after dark, especially for white people, persist, echoing the past. I believe this stems from old social conditioning and is tinged with the memories of racial tensions. Yet, I feel at home here, meeting people who have shown me kindness rather than hostility. Even in the dead of night, I find warmth and acceptance. This is where I've had strangers offer me jackets and money, and where I've felt seen and valued, even on the most dreary nights.",
            "I call Rural America my home, nestled in small-town Michigan. The landscape here is a mix of farmland and tourist hotspots, with no major city malls, national retail chains, or popular restaurants in sight. Driving is essential for any destination. Yet, I live in one of the most breathtaking places, surrounded by water. Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix border my town, and beaches are never far from reach. My neighborhood embodies the essence of a small town. Houses are distinct, not uniform, and many are older, with basements visible from the road. Aluminum siding is common, and houses come in various colors. Most have yards with trampolines, playsets, or gardens. The feel is quintessential Middle America, with hardworking families raising their children. Neighbors are familiar faces, and interactions are friendly. Lawns are well-maintained, and neighbors keep their plants trimmed. It's a peaceful, quiet, and safe sanctuary where people feel secure. Within walking distance, we have the county sheriff's department, health department, recycling center, baseball fields, a small airport, and an ice cream shop. My kids can even bike to the park a few blocks away. It's a wonderful place to call home."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "Living in a big city, my neighborhood is incredibly diverse. Residential areas are scattered all over the place, interspersed with commercial zones. Here, you'll find offices, stores, restaurants, and entertainment spots galore. There's no shortage of new places to dine or shop, with large corporate chains and trendy boutiques lining the streets. Even quieter neighborhoods are bustling with life due to the nearby points of interest. We've got some lovely parks where you'll see kids playing, and the people are as diverse as the city itself. Just a short distance away, you'll find communities like Korea Town, China Town, Little Armenia, and many more, each with its own unique identity. Yet, those few miles can add up to a long commute, especially during rush hour, which is known for its heavy traffic and difficult-to-find parking spots. Interestingly, there's been a lot of construction in recent years with new apartment buildings popping up, but many locals aren't thrilled about more people moving in and more cars on the road. My city is a mix of single-family homes, duplexes, and smaller apartment buildings. The people here are of all ages, and I'm not too familiar with most of my neighbors. It's not like the tight-knit communities of the past. I grew up playing with my next-door neighbor and a few other friends from the neighborhood, but those days are long gone.",
            "My community is quite unique. Most homes here are single-family, but a few have been divided into two, still attached to each other. My house sports a small yard in front and a small driveway to the left. Like many others, it harks back to a time when living in the suburbs was the American dream, though that dream seems to be fading. Yet, my neighborhood and many others still stand, calling out to visitors that this dream is still alive, and we're holding onto it the best we can. The optimism of the past seems to be dwindling, and the maintenance of the yards has gone down, but you'll still find a car or two in every driveway, and kids playing like the world is their whole existence. Our public school, nearly a century old, still stands, inspiring today's youth while evoking nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are always bustling. While every home looks different, they feel the same. There's a large supermarket called 'Super A', owned by a prominent Yemeni family, possibly the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of residents are African American. The streets are wide, and kids usually play soccer, halting briefly to let cars pass. Many residents have been here for generations and can tell tales of a past where everyone knew everyone. A karate school once stood, but it closed when Hollywood stopped making 'Karate Kid' movies. It's now a pharmacy, as drugs, they say, make everything better. There's also an old movie theatre that shows classic films at discounted prices, favored by the elders despite the lack of recent releases. A single expressway runs through my town, with the entrance and exit in the neighboring town. A petition to bring an exit to our town was once supported by the youth but opposed by the elders, who feared it would ruin the town. The elders persuaded the city council to deny the request. A new high school is being built, and we're debating on a town mascot. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the perfect representation of our town.",
            "You might miss it if you're not looking too closely - it's a neighborhood behind a shopping strip, not a place one typically associates with places to live. At least, not places most people would choose to reside in. But step behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods, and further behind the hotels that only see action during family reunions, you'll find a thriving community. Nestled here are several apartment complexes, lined up like Russian nesting dolls that have been carefully dismantled and reassembled beside each other down the road. The first ones you encounter have made headlines for some shady dealings, so we won't dwell too much on those - first impressions can be misleading. But the complexes beyond that, and the two alongside them, are a different story, one that very few locals are aware of. On the other side of the road, there's a community college's satellite campus - a peaceful, quiet set of buildings where students shuffle in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to start their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to let them in one by one, while commuters honk and groan from their cars, held up by the increased traffic on days with higher attendance. The road intersects with another residential street, featuring a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for those who have broken bones. The treatment center has cheerful porch furniture, and a lazy ceiling fan keeps the warm, thick air circulating. Children dart back and forth in the grass, practicing cartwheels and handstands among the prickly green stalks while bees lazily buzz around the flowers along the road. Elderly residents walk their dogs on the path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and smiling at the teenage girls gathered by the playground, chatting about boys and viral sensations. Across from them is a strip mall containing a sushi restaurant, a swimming supply store, and a nail salon tucked in between. You can fill your pool, get a manicure, and enjoy a hibachi meal all at once - the convenience of a strip mall. There's also a DIY frozen yogurt place where you'll often see teens in the park, clinging to cold, sweating cups of toppings while they perform skateboard tricks and vape, believing it to be the coolest. The neighborhood here is a slice of classic Americana - a piece of history in the slow-paced south, where change is a rare occurrence, including the passage of time.",
            "Where is everything? she asked, taking in the vast corn fields that stretched out as far as the eye could see. \"This is it!\" I exclaimed, knowing she'd be surprised at the sheer openness of the landscape. Having grown up in a town where the grocery store was just a five-minute walk from home, this was a world away for her. She was struck by the endless expanse of corn, and I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio. As we drove down a winding country road, we soon came across a water-filled quarry, and just beyond it was the quiet development where I live. The homes, mostly made of brick and stucco, each had at least half an acre of land that residents took great pride in maintaining. During spring, the yards were filled with vibrant flowers and trees that changed with the seasons. Luxury cars like Mercedes Benz gleamed in the sunlight after a good wash, and my Korean neighbor was always tending to his lawn, mowing and singing along to his favorite tunes. Despite his age and the loss of some of his youthful charm, he was a beloved figure in the neighborhood with a fascinating past—he was once a doctor. As we continued along the road, we reached my grey stucco home. Geese were abundant in the side yard, being chased by our Terrier, and out back, a small stream fed into the quarry, with bullfrogs croaking, the stream babbling, and the distant \"moo\" of nearby farm animals. Crossing the handmade wooden bridge led to an undisturbed oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was where I spent most of my childhood, building forts and \"hunting\" animals, always with neighborhood friends. winters in my small town were harsh but beautiful, turning the lush greenery into a stark, snowy wilderness. Trees shed their colorful leaves, and snow angels and snowmen appeared overnight. My sister and I would build massive igloo-like forts for our snowball arsenal, and in our wonderland, we could pretend like there was no tomorrow.",
            "First off, Portland, Oregon is infamous for its \"weird\" reputation. The city's unofficial slogan, scrawled on a building that doubles as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, and strip club, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". Some see this as a nod to the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a time when it was less known and more affordable, birthing unique and creative subcultures. To others, it's an invitation to embrace weirdness, where being different is seen as a compliment. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the constant construction of condos, Portland remains weird. Being weird here doesn't mean accepting everything, but it does mean accepting things that are usually not. Like everywhere else, we buy a lot of our stuff from China, but Portland has a unique twist. We have yoga and hipsters, business professionals, and even goat yoga (yes, yoga with real goats). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things, and many pursue their dreams or dream about doing so while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem, often stemming from mental health issues and the constant rain. It also struggles with homelessness, which isn't easy to solve. The non-homeless population is divided between care and hatred. In this, Portland is not weird at all.",
            "The peaks are constant, standing sentinel in the north, witnessing the sun’s daily journey from dawn to dusk. No matter how much I am consumed by work or life, they stand steadfast, unmoved by life’s turmoil. On days when I am most stressed and burdened, they call out to me, offering solace when I turn to them, lending me the strength to carry on, one day at a time. I first arrived here for my undergrad, and the mountains north of campus were the first to captivate me. While the university also boasts stunning sights in its buildings, ponds, and trees, it’s the mountains that hold the true throne of my admiration. The rest of the town is equally enchanting, with countless cafes serving as homes to many hours of late-night study sessions. One can take a short walk or hop on a bus to the downtown area, where the antiquated buildings and bustling restaurants create an atmosphere that mirrors the city's urban counterpart. This urban-suburban dichotomy gives the town a unique charm, beckoning exploration. Here, I’ve created many cherished memories, each tied to a specific part of town—whether it's strolling past the rusted swings in the park with friends after a long night of studying or rushing through the downtown to catch a movie in the fancy theater. Yet, amidst the joy, there are also harsh memories, as life inevitably brings them. The ponds, in particular, serve as excellent spots for reflection and tears, especially during existential crises in the wee hours. While watching the turtles, ducks, and insects live out their lives, I often ponder my own purpose in this mysterious journey called life. So, I walk past the pond and the park, with its little houses screams of suburbia, until I reach a main street. As the sun’s rays dance atop the palm trees, painting the sky, I realize I am heading north, and there they are, as they always have been—the towering mountains, standing strong and enduring against the hazy blue and yellow sky. They speak to me silently, igniting my resolve to persevere.",
            "Visiting Bensonhurt in Brooklyn, New York, won't be a problem at all! Public transportation is abundant and widely used, making it easy to get around. Bensonhurt is an urban neighborhood, but you won't lose the energy of New York City. Expect to see numerous Asian stores throughout your visit. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has seen a significant increase in Asian inhabitants, leading to many Asian-owned businesses, particularly supermarkets and laundromats, on almost every block. Locals highly regard these businesses, thanks to their excellent quality, affordable prices, and convenience. Just near my place, there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk of each other, making grocery shopping a breeze. While Bensonhurt is predominantly Asian, it's also quite diverse, with a mix of immigrants and their American-born children. Most local businesses, large and small, are Asian-owned. Additionally, there's a recently renovated park nearby, boasting ten basketball courts, a large field for sports like soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and a water fountain. This park is a hub of diversity, where people from all walks of life play together. You won't find many corporate buildings here; instead, you'll see co-op living and condominium apartments, with many two-family houses. Most residents are friendly, but the neighborhood can be quite noisy. Cars blasting music and frequent engine revving can make sleeping difficult, especially during the day. At night, while Bensonhurt is generally safe, it's important to be cautious. While rare, incidents of trouble-making, bullying, and theft can occur. I've experienced both physical assault and package theft in the past, but these were rare occurrences. Dog waste is another common issue. Despite a fine for not cleaning up after dogs, people often ignore this rule, leaving dog waste on the streets. Be prepared to step over it and keep your shoes clean!",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live, making it a bit challenging to navigate. My house sits at the top of the steepest hill in the neighborhood, earning it the nickname \"the work out hill\" for the many joggers who run up it daily. Since there aren't any sidewalks, everyone walks on the road, which can be quite rough in places and feels a bit hazardous to drive on. The road's condition is made worse by the frequent storms and heavy rain in our area, which often cause telephone and electric wires to tatter and require constant repairs. The block is shaded by tall evergreen trees, but the locals aren't fond of them, as they often chop down as many as possible to clear their view of the ocean. Many houses are built high up on the hill with large glass-fronted second stories to enjoy the view of the bay. The sunset here is breathtaking, with the water lighting up and the sky turning orange, but the weather is often overcast and damp. Moss covers everything it can, turning my car green and furry if left outside for too long. There aren't many children around, but there's a school nearby. Most residents are older, often retired, and instead of kids, they have dogs. It's common to see them roaming around or racing through the streets. The neighborhood is also filled with wild rabbits that gardeners dislike because they damage plants and lawns. My cats love hunting them, though. We have a variety of birds, too, from small sparrows and hummingbirds to the occasional hawk or eagle, which is usually chased off by neighborhood crows. There aren't any stores nearby, but if you walk downhill to the waterfront, there are a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. The beach isn't great, but the rocky shore is fun for throwing stones into the water. The bay isn't very wide, and you can see the opposite shore through the mist most days.",
            "I live in a typical suburban area in a small southern Tennessee town. Our street connects two state highways, so we experience a bit more traffic than I'd prefer, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. Not many folks move in or out, so I've grown accustomed to most of the residents. During the day, people busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores. In the winter, we enjoy sledding down a hill on our side street. Our house is at the corner, so we see everyone coming and going. Whenever we spot an unfamiliar vehicle, we take note. Some neighbors go for walks with their dogs or just for exercise, and kids play on their bikes, as you'd expect in such a neighborhood. We're often at home because we work from our house—myself, my wife, and our two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen. That means we're quite familiar to the neighbors as well. We enjoy being outside, sometimes even in the rain, and we occasionally grill on our back deck. There's always someone cutting grass around here, with lawn mowers running nearly daily from March through October. Our neighborhood has lots of trees, remnants of the original wooded area, providing plenty of shade. Fall brings a yearly task of raking and burning leaves, and I do enjoy that smell of burning leaves. We've had a mild winter, so it feels like a long fall. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we seldom use the front door unless someone knocks on it, which is rare. I like working in the garage on my truck or other projects. With the garage doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays are quiet here, with Thanksgiving and other holidays seeing some families visiting from out of town. If it weren't for the through street, it would be ideal.",
            "My neighborhood in the high desert is right in the heart of dirt, dirt, and more dirt. If you haven't experienced it, you can't truly understand the constant brown. If you do see a lawn, you know the owner is spending a fortune on it. When I first moved here in the 90s, houses were spread out. Now, the place is still the same, but there are many new additions, making it look more like a city every day. Most people are friendly, but like any city, there are good and bad parts. I'm surrounded by friendly old folks, so I'd say it's a nice neighborhood. The shops are mostly big chains like Food for Less and Smart & Final. If you're looking for upscale stores, you'll have to travel. I don't see any Whole Foods or similar stores. The most prominent jobs here are in construction, likely because the city is still developing and there's a lot of open space. This makes me a bit uneasy; I like things the way they are now, having left a big city. My full-time job is in construction, as a drywall and T-bar installer. The desert has its own unique attractions. People visit for its stark beauty and the diverse wildlife. We've adapted well to the wildlife, with my three children obsessed with lizards and desert bugs—currently, they're outside trying to catch some. For attractions, Victorville is a great family spot. If you can, time your visit with the San Bernardino County Fair. It's a unique experience. Nearby Wrightwood offers snow-covered mountains and winter sports. If you're into natural history and culture, check out the Victor Valley Museum. It has geological, paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell Victorville's story.",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'd say my answer is pretty unique. Unlike folks who might be homeowners with their own personal lives, mine is a bit different. I see my neighborhood as the college campus I live on, and my dormitory as my community. Sure, the campus itself is a part of my neighborhood too, but it's not as intimate. Despite this, my neighborhood shares some standard features with more conventional ones: houses, people, stores, and a park. Let's start with the houses. There are three main types of housing where I live: apartments, houses, and dorms. Apartments usually have 2-4 people per room with about 4-6 rooms per floor. A typical building can house around 20 people. Actual houses are available for anyone connected to the school and usually house alumni. There are only a few of these, though, as they're less efficient than the others. Finally, the dorms are the most common, housing hundreds of students with two people per room. Now, let's talk people. My school is diverse, and that reflects in the people who call my neighborhood home. You'll find professionals living in houses, newer students in dorms, and older students in apartments. I could go on about the people, but it's hard to do them justice, so let's move on to the stores and parks. Since the school is self-contained, it has plenty of stores and a single park. The stores are like any other neighborhood's, but we've got unique clothing and grocery stores too. Everything you need is within our borders! And finally, the park is a playground for all, maintained by our diverse community.",
            "Alright, considering I've been living here for almost a decade, I suppose I can share some stuff I've learned. First off, I was really bummed when I first moved to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I'm not going to lie, I cried because I missed my old place and I loved it.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better housing location, better high school, and everything was considered “not ghetto”. Over the years, I got comfortable with it, made new friends, and even some enemies at school. I never really got to know my neighbors well, except Mr. Glen and his kids, as well as Dennis for a bit, both next door. They're great people, like family, and I appreciate them a lot. I remember when we went to Mr. Glen's wedding (they got re-married), it was awesome. I caught the bouquet, but not the flowers! We danced the night away, and I really enjoyed spending time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I hope she's doing well. The neighborhood is like a maze, but now I have a GPS, so I can explore more. I've only gone so far, like when I hung out with friends Kason and Curtis. We used to play video games a lot, and just enjoy life. Sometimes I'd go to the park and enjoy nature, which calms me down these days. I bring sticks from Home Depot and practice my balance, and if I can, my bokken wooden sword. It's fun doing what I love. There's also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven't played in a while. My dad and best friend grew up playing tennis with Mr. Graves, and we always had a blast. I guess there are plenty of fun stories, but these are what really stand out to me, and I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "Living close to my college is something I truly appreciate about my neighborhood. The area is mostly occupied by apartment buildings, along with a handful of restaurants and bars that offer fun nights out without breaking the bank. One of the bars recently changed its name and, while it's a bit pricier, the service and drinks are still decent. Most of my neighbors are either college students or from lower-income backgrounds, and the management of my building has introduced an air freshener unit near a neighbor's door who often smokes weed, which my boyfriend and I find amusing. The buildings around me are generally old but may have received interior upgrades. A bit further down the street, there are newer apartment complexes, but they look cheaply built, and the rent is high, which I find misleading. There's a budget-friendly restaurant nearby that serves most meals on paper plates and uses microwaves, and across from it is a gas station with mixed reviews. Last summer, the city invested in road reconstruction, adding a wide sidewalk, plenty of greenery, and making the area more pleasant. My apartment is surrounded by trees, although a few have been cut down, and there's a tree line behind, leading to another set of apartments. I live on 42nd Street, but right behind me is 43rd Street, which isn't as appealing. The sidewalks are in poor condition, and many buildings look shabby. While there are plenty of trees, they may be hiding the building's appearance, and some crime has occurred at the apartments on that street. My neighborhood isn't perfect, but it's affordable, and there are useful amenities nearby, like the university and bus stops, making it convenient to get to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood is a bunch of duplexes on a cul-de-sac, arranged so they look like individual houses. We're all painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Everyone here is pretty much friends, and we often hang out at the end of the driveway, chatting while the kids play. It's like stepping back in time, surrounded by fields, trees, and blue skies. The only buzzkill is the tornado warnings we've been getting. Last night, we heard the sirens and took shelter. My little dog joined me in the bathtub with some pillows, while the bigger one stayed in the living room, barking nervously. After the storm, the road was steaming hot and the hail melted instantly. Then came a double rainbow! I snapped pics to share with friends. The neighborhood was quiet, but then people started coming home and everything went back to normal, with moms and kids out as dinner cooked. It's a great place to live, with a southern accent I love, and a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment. Not all apartments are the same on the inside, but that's okay. The biggest field behind my place leads to a pond, and I've seen deer and heard frogs singing in the morning. It's like living in a small village, with a donkey on a nearby farm that brays in the evenings. I was lucky to find this peaceful neighborhood.",
            "When I transitioned into eighth grade, I found myself in a new neighborhood, which was initially a bit tough to adjust to, especially when it came to making friends. However, I eventually clicked with a couple of guys, one living two houses down and another on my street. Although they've moved away, the memories linger. The neighborhood remains much the same, with a mix of two-story homes and a lot of kid's laughter echoing on warm weekend days. Mostly quiet during the week, it’s a community where you can count on neighbors if you need a hand. I've ordered plenty of packages without any issues, which instills trust in the people around me. A park a stone’s throw from my house holds both cherished and painful recollections—from intense games of basketball, football, and baseball to the time I got elbowed in a football match. Now, I visit the park to spend time with my cousin’s kids, who find joy in simple things like swings and slides. The park evokes a sense of nostalgia. The neighborhood is wonderfully diverse, with a delightful blend of cuisines right at our doorstep—Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian, among others. These days, people often turn to apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for their meals. The neighborhood is also well-supplied with amenities—dry cleaners, drugstores like Walgreens and CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store. There's even an Indian-owned store for those who love homemade or ready-made Indian food. Overall, I’m quite fond of my neighborhood. Reading about the troubles other people face with their neighbors makes me appreciate mine even more.",
            "My neighborhood is a small, picturesque town nestled in South Carolina. While it's not remarkable, it plays a vital role in the agricultural sector. Johnston, known as the Peach Capital of the World, is proud to boast this title on its welcoming sign. The town is dominated by vast fields of peach trees and cattle. Houses are typically located in the outskirts, with many being two-story structures featuring metal or gray shingle roofs to manage the intense summer heat. These homes are usually situated away from the road, allowing the front fields to be used for farming or livestock. Within the main town, a single stoplight hangs at a four-way intersection, where the only stores are located. You can find Chinese, Mexican, and burger fast food joints, along with a small, family-owned pharmacy named Maxwell and Halford Drug, renowned for its Cherry Coca-Cola. There's also a premium grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, which is the town's only grocery option, though many residents prefer to shop at a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville. The town's most popular store is Dollar General, which sells a wide range of everyday items and stays busy from morning to night. A small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, offers deliveries, and nearby, there's Clark's Cuts and Kennels for pet grooming services. Medical care is provided by a doctor's and veterinary practice located away from the main town. Johnston has a single elementary school, but students must travel to the next town for middle and high school. There are no large parks, but the town is in the process of creating a 2.5-acre recreational area to attract visitors and residents. Despite the lack of theaters, bowling alleys, or numerous restaurants, it's a pleasant town, so small that you might miss it if you blink!",
            "I first heard about my place from a podcast featuring stories of people who'd gone missing. It was a bit surprising, considering most apartments in the area were priced over a thousand dollars a month. None of my friends knew anything about this, and I'd never heard of it either. Maybe it's the struggle. I know some of my friends find it so hard that they cry themselves to sleep at night. Life's expensive, but we've adapted to be frugal. You start appreciating the dusty smell of old flea market toys and thrifted clothes. You smell less, and you might even start smoking, or just accept things as they are. But the thrift stores always draw you in. The scent of adult life is like old magazines stacked on a closed piano, wedged into the leather and lingering even after a wash. There are three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start at the far end, you can visit two charity shops, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling, with cars and people every morning, but the stores are always quiet, even with the constant traffic. It's a peaceful place to spend an afternoon. Each year, there are more developments. Cars and people fill the city, making it a growing place. It's like New York, where everyone's focused on their goals, and no one asks for much from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where showing concern means you care. You don't pry here, and you can keep your distance as long as you like, and the city will flow like waves. It's a lively place. Between the musician next door and the vocalists upstairs, there's always some activity. In a way, it's more like a community of friends than just neighbors. We come together for birthdays, mournings, and help each other out. I'm lucky to live here. I get along well with most of my neighbors, and they treat me kindly. I make sure to clean up after myself and leave them food, and they do the same for me. I'll even bring them mail, and they do the same for me. It's nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my presence just as much as I do theirs. Despite living in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl, it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I haven't ruined my life.",
            "My neighborhood could be summed up as your garden variety cookie-cutter suburbia. The local homeowner's association makes its presence known through immaculately kept single-family homes, each with a small front yard, decorative pebbles, and a two-car garage. The streets are newly paved and free of potholes, a testament to the HOA's dedication to uniformity. Most houses are single story, but you'll find a few two-story homes scattered here and there. Mail is handed out through a communal system at the end of the street, with individual key access to mailboxes and large lockers for packages. The neighborhood is situated on the outskirts of a large city, blending rural and suburban elements. We have a lot of land to spare, with multiple community pools and walking trails for dog walks or evening strolls. The community is primarily made up of retired residents, with a smattering of middle-aged and young professionals. The city itself is large in population but retains a small-town charm. We have all the necessary amenities like a mall, grocery stores offering organic foods, and bargain outlets. Though it takes a short drive to get to significant places, there's no shortage of shopping options once you arrive. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and quite typical, with plenty of nice amenities like pools and trails. The community looks out for each other, and while we're not right next door to major shopping, a quick car ride will get you anywhere you need to go.",
            "I reside in a small Midwestern town that borders the outskirts of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, situated on the east side, is one of the most economically marginalized areas. Property values here are low, with many homes rented or owned by those of modest means. Despite this, the area is not unpleasant, with neighbors who are generally friendly and offer a warm smile when I walk by. Crime rates, while slightly higher than in other areas, are still manageable. In the past decade, a few violent crimes have occurred within a few blocks of my residence, including a couple of shootings and a single homicide. Our neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Fortunately, our family has fortunately escaped direct involvement in any crime except for the occasional disappearance of items from our porch when left unattended. The town has been significantly impacted by the “opioid epidemic,” with many lives lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Thankfully, there are numerous resources to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. While facing these challenges, my town has many positive aspects. My son’s elementary school boasts an excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite his special needs, he hasn’t faced any bullying due to the school’s positive atmosphere, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that organizes multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Given that over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. No child or family is treated as \"less than\" based on their ability to pay, and school fees, supplies, and field trip costs are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made several improvements to the town's appearance, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Most of these improvements have been concentrated in the town center and on the west side, where all shopping areas are located and most traffic passes through. The east side, where I live, tends to be overlooked, a point of contention among my neighborhood residents. Nonetheless, I genuinely enjoy living here. The people are friendly, the schools are excellent, there are sufficient shopping options, and while our home may not be worth much, it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is a cultural haven. It sits upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical significance. I reside in a 7-story apartment building directly opposite an old live theatre, and just a block away is a quaint arcade bar that draws in a diverse crowd on warm summer nights. Throughout June and July, lines of people queue up to get inside. A few blocks up is a large city park, with concrete walls and tall steps encircling it. During winter, homeless people set up tents in rows along the sidewalk and steps, staying warm by huddling close together and within walking distance of the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. The city's beauty lies not just in its historic architecture but in the people who inhabit it. Hilltop was once notorious for gang violence, and stories of federal sweeps are still passed down from generation to generation. Despite its reputation, the neighborhood has worked hard to clean up and maintain a sense of community. However, warnings about walking the Hill after dark, especially for white people, persist, echoing the past. I believe this stems from old social conditioning and is tinged with the memories of racial tensions. Yet, I feel at home here, meeting people who have shown me kindness rather than hostility. Even in the dead of night, I find warmth and acceptance. This is where I've had strangers offer me jackets and money, and where I've felt seen and valued, even on the most dreary nights.",
            "I call Rural America my home, nestled in small-town Michigan. The landscape here is a mix of farmland and tourist hotspots, with no major city malls, national retail chains, or popular restaurants in sight. Driving is essential for any destination. Yet, I live in one of the most breathtaking places, surrounded by water. Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix border my town, and beaches are never far from reach. My neighborhood embodies the essence of a small town. Houses are distinct, not uniform, and many are older, with basements visible from the road. Aluminum siding is common, and houses come in various colors. Most have yards with trampolines, playsets, or gardens. The feel is quintessential Middle America, with hardworking families raising their children. Neighbors are familiar faces, and interactions are friendly. Lawns are well-maintained, and neighbors keep their plants trimmed. It's a peaceful, quiet, and safe sanctuary where people feel secure. Within walking distance, we have the county sheriff's department, health department, recycling center, baseball fields, a small airport, and an ice cream shop. My kids can even bike to the park a few blocks away. It's a wonderful place to call home."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "My home is in a bustling metropolis where diversity is the norm. Residential zones are scattered amongst commercial areas, with businesses ranging from corporate offices to local stores and eateries. There's no shortage of new eateries and shops to explore. Larger, well-known brands rub shoulders with small boutiques that line the streets, often in walking distance of otherwise peaceful neighborhoods. Parks nearby have become popular hangout spots for locals and their kids. As for the people, my neighborhood is a melting pot of cultures. Within a small radius, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a group of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Further out, there are more communities representing various ethnicities, such as Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia. While they're just a few miles away, these communities are created for ease of access to cultural experiences and support. The city's size means that even a short 10-mile drive can take hours due to traffic, especially during peak hours. Very few people walk due to the city's vastness, leading to one of the world's worst traffic conditions and a scarcity of parking spots. Conversely, there's been a construction boom with new apartment buildings springing up, which is both a draw and a source of frustration for some residents who dread the influx of more people and vehicles. Residential areas offer a range of housing options, from single-family homes to duplexes and smaller apartment buildings. My neighborhood is no exception, providing a mix of housing types and ages. While I'm not familiar with most of my neighbors, I have fond childhood memories of playing with neighboring kids. It isn't a close-knit community anymore, but it was once a lively place for neighborhood playtime.",
            "My neighborhood has an interesting layout. Most of the homes are single-family, but a few have been converted into attached duplexes. My residence boasts a small front yard and a narrow driveway positioned to the left of the house. Like many others, it evokes a sense of the American dream from a bygone era, a dream that still resonates with those who live here, though the optimism has waned, and the upkeep of the yards has declined. Yet, there's still a car or two in almost every driveway, and children continue to play as if the world revolves around them. The long-standing public school, which has been here for nearly nine decades, still stirs hope in the youth and nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, most being empty, but the basketball courts remain filled with eager players. Each home may look different, but there's a sense of unity among them. A large supermarket named \"Super A,\" owned by a prominent Yemeni family, is the only such establishment in the neighborhood. The resident population is predominantly African American, with many families having roots in the area for generations. The streets are wide and kids play football, only pausing to let the cars pass. The neighborhood once had a karate school, which closed when karate's popularity wavered, and now operates as a pharmacy due to the perception that drugs can solve everything. There's also an old movie theater that shows classic films at a discounted price, a favorite among the elders who see it as a convenient night out, minus the kids. A single expressway runs through our town, but the nearby town has the exits and entrances. Despite a youth-led petition to bring one to our town, the elders' concerns about ruining the town's charm swayed the city council against the proposal. A new high school is under construction, and we're debating on a mascot. I suggest a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin to symbolize our town's unique identity.",
            "You might miss it by the looks of it - a residential area tucked behind a shopping strip, far from where one might expect to live. But if you venture behind the dilapidated Whole Foods and walk past the hotels that only spring to life during family reunions, you'll stumble upon a thriving community. Hidden within these neighborhoods, a few apartment complexes stand side by side, much like Russian nesting dolls that have been carefully disassembled and arranged in a row. The first ones you encounter may not paint a good picture, but the ones beside them and the ones after that reveal a different story. Across from these complexes, you'll find a community college's satellite campus, a quiet, peaceful oasis where students start their days with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning. The iron gates creak open to admit them, often causing commuters to shake their fists and groan at the traffic delays. The road intersects with another residential street, housing a park and a rehabilitation center for those who have suffered unfortunate bone injuries. The center boasts cheerful porch furniture and a lazy ceiling fan that sweeps the warm summer air back and forth. Children race and play in the grass, bees buzz in the flower patches, and retirees walk their dogs, scowling at skateboarding teens and nodding to the girls gathered by the playground. Nearby, a sushi place in a strip mall offers affordable food, a sports store, and a nail salon. You could fill your pool while getting a manicure and enjoying hibachi chicken - the convenience of a strip mall. A DIY frozen yogurt shop serves up cold, sweet treats for the teens who flock to the park, clutching their toppings-covered cups as they perform tricks on their skateboards and vape. This neighborhood is a slice of Americana, a piece of history in the sleepy south where time seems to stand still.",
            "“Where are we?” she asked as we drove past the seemingly endless fields of corn. “This is the countryside!” I exclaimed, knowing she’d be stunned by the vast openness. She hailed from a town where the grocery store was a short walk from her home—she’d never seen so much open space before. Surprised by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what life was like growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood who I was and where I came from.

Continuing along the road to my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outdoors with a cheerful smile. He spends his days mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over the hum of his John Deere Zero Turn mower. The locals find him amusing, but he’s always genuine and has an incredible personal history. Now older, he’s lost some of his wit, and in his past, he was a doctor. He blends in with the grass and his mower, always tending to his lawn. Finally, you'll reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier.

            "The first thing you need to grasp about Portland, Oregon is its reputation for being quirky. The city's unofficial motto, found on a pizza joint and bar that serves as a music venue and strip club while occasionally pushing the boundaries, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this slogan is a reminder of the Portland from the 90s and early 2000s—a Portland that was less known and more affordable, fostering unique and creative subcultures. For others, it's an invitation to embrace Portland's embrace of the strange, where being called \"weird\" is a compliment. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the ongoing construction of condos to accommodate them, Portland remains peculiar. Being weird doesn't mean being accepting of everything but does mean accepting of things that are typically not welcomed. Weird doesn't mean we lack modern amenities and challenges; we, like the rest of the nation, source most of our goods from China. Portland offers a million ways to be weird, to be unusual, yet it also has plenty of normality—yoga classes, hipster enclaves, and business professionals. Maybe being weird just means we take all of this a bit less seriously. In my neighborhood, and many others in Portland, you'll see vibrant houses, home gardens with flowers, herbs, and vegetables, and free boxes during the summer. These free boxes are traditional cardboard boxes where people discard items, but they can also be plastic bags or boxes. They contain treasures—clothes, books, anything—perfect for the lucky passerby. The mystery of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is about to me, but I'm just one variety of weird among countless others. Some residents I live with would never pick clothes from a sidewalk box. They prefer goat yoga (yes, yoga with real goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is filled with people who love all sorts of things and pursue their dreams, or at least dream about pursuing them while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland faces a drug problem. Such issues often stem from mental health struggles, and the constant rain and gloomy skies may contribute to this. Portland also grapples with homelessness, which is challenging to address due to the lack of effective solutions across the country. The non-homeless population oscillates between empathy and hostility. In this, we're quite normal.",
            "The mountains stand tall, a constant sentinel in the north, greeting the sun's rise and fall with unyielding steadfastness. No matter how much I get caught up in life or forget about them, they are ever-present, unaffected by life's ups and downs. On days when I am most stressed, their silent strength calls out to me, offering solace and renewed resolve. I first moved here for my undergrad, and the mountains became my earliest fascination. Though the university has its own beauty, with stunning buildings, ponds, and trees, it's the mountains that hold my heart. The town itself is a mix of charming cafes and a bustling downtown area, where the energy of a city meets the serenity of a small town. This blend creates a unique atmosphere, as if the city is inviting exploration. Here, I've created memorable moments—from late-night chats with friends in the park to movie nights in the university’s fancy theater. Yet, it also holds harsh memories, as all places do. The ponds, particularly, have been a place of reflection and tears, especially during existential crises. Watching the wildlife live out their roles has made me question my own purpose, a struggle I have more experience with. I've walked past these reflective spots, through the park and suburban houses, until I reached a main street. With the sun shining on palm trees, I realized I was heading north. As the sun painted the sky, I saw the mountains, strong and stoic, guiding me with their silent strength. They stirred within me a sense of perseverance.",
            "If you are planning a visit to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you won't have trouble finding it! Public transportation is easily accessible and is one of the primary ways people travel in New York City. Bensonhurst is quite urban, so you'll still feel like you're in the heart of the city. Keep an eye out for the many Asian stores you'll see during your visit. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurst has seen a significant increase in its Asian population, with Asian-owned businesses such as supermarkets and laundromats on nearly every block. Locals appreciate the high-quality food and lower prices, and the convenience makes it a popular choice. In fact, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of each other near my place. Despite the prevalence of Asian businesses, Bensonhurst is diverse, with immigrants and their children making up a significant part of the population. Additionally, the neighborhood has a recently renovated park with numerous sports facilities, swings, and a playground, catering to various ages and preferences.\n\nWhile Bensonhurst isn't overrun with corporate buildings, it has co-op living spaces and condominium apartments. Most residents live in two-family houses, and while people are generally nice, noise can be an issue. Blasting music from cars and aggressive driving are common, which can make it challenging to get a good night's sleep. While Bensonhurst is relatively safe, it's important to stay alert, especially at night. There can be unpredictable individuals, including bullies and thieves. I've experienced physical assault and package theft in the past, and while it's not common anymore, it's good to be cautious. New York City has laws against leaving dog waste, but these rules aren't always followed here. In the morning, you might encounter dog waste on your way to the train station or supermarket. It's crucial to keep your shoes clean, as this can be quite bothersome.\n\nIn summary, Bensonhurst offers a mix of Asian and diverse communities with convenient shopping options and a well-equipped park. However, noise and occasional incidents of theft and littering are drawbacks to be aware of during your visit.",
            "The sidewalks around my neighborhood are scarce, with my house perched right at the top of the steepest hill. Joggers fondly refer to it as the \"work out hill,\" but the lack of sidewalks means everyone walks on the road, which can be quite treacherous. The road is filled with potholes and the sight of telephone and electric wires strung up in a tattered state. We get heavy rainfall and storms frequently here, which often brings down branches and debris, leaving the wires looking worn and patched. Towering evergreen trees surround the area, but they're not popular with the locals who try to cut them down as they obstruct the view of the ocean. Many homes are built high up on the hill with large glass-fronted second stories to take advantage of the view. At sunset, the water seems to glow from below, and the sky turns a beautiful orange. However, the weather is often overcast and damp, with moss growing on practically everything, including my car which turned green and furry after being left in my driveway for a month. There are more dogs than children in the neighborhood, and many of the people are older, with retirees making up a significant portion. Instead of kids, people have pets. Rabbits also run wild in the area, digging up gardens and burrowing in lawns, much to the delight of my cats. We also have an array of birds, from small sparrows and hummingbirds to occasional hawks or eagles that are usually chased off by neighborhood crows. There are no stores nearby, but a short hike down to the waterfront has a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. The beach isn't particularly big, but the rocks along the shore are enjoyable to toss into the water. The bay is quite narrow, allowing you to see the opposite shoreline clearly through the mist on most days.",
            "I reside in a typical suburban setting of a small southern town in Tennessee. Our street serves as a connector between two state highways, which leads to a bit more traffic than I'd prefer, but otherwise, it's a quiet neighborhood. The influx of new residents is minimal, so I've grown accustomed to most of my neighbors. They usually keep busy with yard work and daily chores. In the winter, we hit the slopes on our side street. Our home is situated at the corner, allowing us to observe everyone coming and going throughout the day. We're accustomed to the vehicles that frequent our street; any strange ones catch our attention. Some neighbors take leisurely walks or walk their dogs. Kids ride their bikes, and it's all quite typical. We work from home, so we're often seen around the neighborhood. There are four of us in the family: myself, my wife, and our two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen. People are familiar with us coming and going, and we often engage in outdoor activities, even in the rain. On occasion, we enjoy grilling on our back deck, with the pleasant aroma of the barbecue filling the air. The lawn mowers are a constant presence from March through October, the grass growing season. The neighborhood is quite wooded, providing ample shade, but it means regular leaf raking and burning in the fall, which I find enjoyable. Winter has been mild, extending the fall season. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we seldom use the front door unless someone knocks, which is infrequent. I often work in the garage, tinkering with my truck or other projects, feeling more connected to the neighborhood when the garage door is open. Holidays like Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, and Christmas see extra visitors, with additional cars parked around the neighborhood. Overall, I appreciate living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be ideal.",
            "My neighborhood is smack dab in the middle of the high desert, a place where dirt, dirt, and more dirt reign supreme. Unless you've lived here, it's hard to comprehend the constant sight of brown landscapes, and even when you see a lawn, you know its owner is spending a fortune on lawn care. Back in the 90s, this place was dotted with houses scattered far and wide; now, it's still the same, but with many new additions. It's slowly transforming into a city, with its friendly and not-so-friendly aspects. I'm surrounded by senior citizens who make this neighborhood feel like a pleasant place to live. The stores here are mostly chains, like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final, with very few local or upscale options. The most common jobs here are in construction, as this city is still largely undeveloped and open for building. This makes me a bit nervous, as I prefer this place the way it is. I left the big city and I'm not eager to return. My job, as a drywall and T-bar installer, is in this field. I love the diverse wildlife here. People visit for the stark beauty of the desert and the challenging ecosystems it creates. Learning about the non-human residents who share this environment is crucial for safe coexistence. My family has embraced this wildlife; my three children are fascinated by lizards and desert bugs. Attractions include the annual San Bernardino County Fair in Victorville and the snow-covered mountains in nearby Wrightwood, which offer a unique desert experience. The Victor Valley Museum showcases the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem, with geological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical items telling the story of Victorville's development.",
            "I'd say my neighborhood is a bit unique compared to what others might be used to. While others might be describing their own homes and immediate surroundings, I'm talking about the college campus where I reside. The people living in my dormitory are my community, and the campus grounds are my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser degree. Despite this, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with traditional ones, such as having houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's dive into the \"houses\" in my neighborhood first. To start, there are three types of housing here: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory houses. Apartments house between 2-4 people per room, each floor has about 4-6 rooms, with the most common buildings having 2 floors, accommodating around 20 people per building. Actual houses are usually 2-4 bedrooms and are rented by school affiliates, but they're less common. Lastly, dorm rooms are the norm, with 100s of students living here, each room usually housing 2 people, with the exception of some. Moving on to the people, my school's diversity is reflected in my neighborhood. We have people of all cultures and ages. Professionals like staff live in affiliate houses, newer students in dorms, and older students in apartments. Discussing the people in depth would be unfair, so let's move on to the stores and parks. My school is a self-contained neighborhood, boasting a variety of stores and a single park. The stores offer dining options and the school's unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. Need anything? It's within reach! The park is a playground for all and kept clean and safe by the neighborhood's members.",
            "I've been living in this neighborhood for nearly a decade now, and I've got a story or two to share. Initially, moving from Riverdale to Stockbridge wasn't easy. I was devastated, missing the familiar faces and places, but my parents had our best interests at heart, so we moved for better housing and a top-notch high school. Over time, I made new friends and some new acquaintances too, but the ones who stand out are Mr. Glen and his family, and Dennis, our neighbors. They've become like family to me, and I truly appreciate their company. I remember attending Mr. Glen's re-marriage - an enjoyable event where I caught Ms. Veda's bouquet strap! I wish I'd caught the flowers too. Dancing the night away with Marsharii, his daughter, was a blast. I haven't seen her since, but I hope she's doing well. This neighborhood is a bit of a maze, but with GPS, I can explore more. I've hung out with friends Kason and Curtis, playing video games and enjoying life to the fullest. Sometimes, I just head to the park for some peace and tranquility. I'll practice my balancing tricks with sticks from Home Depot and bring my bokken wooden sword for fun. There's a basketball and tennis court too, though I haven't played in a while. My dad and Mr. Graves used to toughen us up with tennis; we always had a great time, even if it was challenging. This neighborhood has plenty of great memories, and I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood's close to the college I attend, so I enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are a fun, affordable spot. One bar just got a new name; it's pricier but the service and drinks are decent. Most locals are either college kids or lower income, given the cheaper rent. Kids are nearby since there's an elementary school close by. I don't know my neighbors, and they're quite the smokers, which led management to put an air freshener near their door, a funny but almost insulting move. The buildings around me are old but have been renovated. Down the street, there are newly built apartments, but their quality isn't great, despite the expensive rent. Across from a cheap, paper-plate restaurant and a questionable gas station, the area's improved thanks to city money. Trees surround my apartment complex, with a few stumps, but more trees than the road behind. My street, 42nd, is nicer than 43rd, which has falling apart sidewalks and shabby buildings. Crime's happened around here, and some neighboring apartments have a transient population. But I like it; it's affordable and convenient. The university is nearby, and there are two bus stops for easy shopping and downtown trips.",
            "My neighborhood is comprised of duplexes on a cul-de-sac, scattered in such a way that they resemble individual houses. Every home is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs, and almost everyone knows each other. We often gather at the end of a not-so-planned driveway, chatting while the neighborhood kids play with their toys, sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. It's incredibly refreshing, a stark contrast to our modern, tech-filled world. We're surrounded by fields and trees, enhanced by a clear blue sky and fluffy white clouds. The only bummer? This season has brought tornado warnings, and last night we heard the sirens for the first time. I found myself in my bathtub with my smallest dog, some pillows, and my purse. My bigger dog refused to join us and stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The neighborhood was eerily quiet except for the sound of heavy hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road was steaming from the temperature change, dropping from 92 degrees to 75 in minutes. The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement. As I looked up, the sky cleared and it started to rain, revealing a double rainbow. I rushed inside, grabbed my camera, and snapped photos to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were as awestruck as I was. The streets remained quiet for an hour before some people started to return home. Then it was back to normal, with moms and kids playing outside while dinner cooked. It's a welcoming neighborhood for this gal who's newly moved from NH to NC. I have a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, as do my neighbors. Despite the uniformity on the outside, the interiors vary greatly in size. Some are incredibly small, which doesn't make sense to me. I enjoy taking leisurely walks along the biggest field behind my home and heading down to the non-swimmable pond. I've spotted deer there, and in the morning, you can hear a massive bullfrog serenading. It's a fantastic place to live, just a forty-minute drive from Charlotte. Each morning is greeted by the sound of roosters crowing from nearby farms. It's like living in a small, self-contained community. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that brays in the evening to announce his presence. I'm fortunate to have found such a gem of a neighborhood.",
            "I arrived in this neighborhood on the cusp of starting eighth grade. Initially, making friends was challenging, but I soon became close with someone living two houses down and another guy on my street. Though they no longer reside here, the memories remain. Many of the original residents are still around, so it feels like home. Our neighborhood is quite typical of an American suburb, complete with two-story houses. Weekends and warm days are filled with the sound of kids playing outside. Weekdays are quieter, and I've never encountered any issues with my neighbors. I trust them enough to leave packages on my porch without fear of theft. A park just a minute or two away holds many memories of basketball, football, and baseball games with the neighborhood kids. One of my fondest memories is playing football there, though I did suffer a nose injury from an elbow. The park now serves as a place for me to spend time with my cousin's young kids, who love playing on the swings and slides. The park brings back feelings of nostalgia. Diversity is abundant in our neighborhood, with a plethora of restaurants within a mile radius. You can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian cuisine. Many folks use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for delivery. Fast food and pizza places are also plentiful, as they are in most suburban neighborhoods. The stores here have everything you could need, including a variety of dry cleaners, Walgreens, CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store. There's even an Indian-owned store for those craving homemade or ready-made Indian food. Overall, I'm grateful for our neighborhood, especially when I read about the challenges other people face with their neighbors on social media and in the news.",
            "My hometown, Johnston in South Carolina, is a charming little place that's not much different from others in the area, but it's got a significant role in the state's agriculture sector. It's proudly known as the Peach Capital of the World, a title it boasts on its welcoming sign. The landscape is dominated by farmland, either filled with peach trees or cattle. Houses are spaced out, usually two-story structures with either metal roofs to withstand the scorching heat or gray shingles. These homes are often located away from the road, allowing the front fields to be used for farming or livestock. In the heart of town, there's a single stoplight at the four-way intersection where the only stores are located. There are three \"fast food\" options: Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family; Fiesta Mexican Restaurant; and Gary's, a small burger chain. A pizzeria closed down recently. There's also Maxwell and Halford Drug, a small family-owned pharmacy that's famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola. The Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, is the only grocery store, but many residents prefer to shop at a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for most of their groceries. Dollar General is the most popular store, bustling from opening to closing time. Possibilities Furniture & More is a small furniture store run by a well-known community member. Attached to it is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, where you can find daycare, boarding, grooming, and other pet care services. Both a doctor's and a veterinary practice are located away from the main part of town, both are small but well-equipped to serve the town's residents. Johnston Elementary School is the only school in town, but once students reach fifth grade, they must attend middle and high school in the next town over. There are no parks, but a 2.5-acre recreational area is in the works to provide families with more outing opportunities and attract visitors. Despite the lack of entertainment options like movie theaters, bowling alleys, or playgrounds, it's a nice town, so small you can pass through without noticing in the blink of an eye!",
            "The first time I heard about my place, it was while listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a bit surprising, given that the rent here is over a thousand dollars a month. None of my friends or I had any idea about this, so maybe it's just the struggle we're in. I know some friends cry themselves to sleep at night because of the cost. We've learned to be frugal over the years. You start to appreciate the unique smell of flea market toys and used clothes. The adult world is full of that dusty smell. Some people might take up smoking, or they might just get used to the way things are. But the flea market is always there. It's a place where you can spend an afternoon and hear nothing but silence. There are three thrift stores within walking distance, and you can also find a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop if you walk a little farther. Downtown is bustling with people and cars every morning, but it's surprisingly quiet in the thrift stores. It reminders me of New York. Everyone's on their own agenda, and no one asks much of you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and no one will bother you. It's not like the South, where just being polite means you care. You don't pry into other people's lives here. You can keep to yourself as much as you like, and the city will continue on just fine. It's a lively place to be. The pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs make sure of that. We have a sense of community here, helping each other out when we need it. I've made some great neighbors, and they're kind enough to leave me food and help with my mail. I even like most of them. It's not just a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl; it's the people that make it feel like a home.",
            "The region where I live can be considered your run-of-the-mill cookie-cutter suburb. The presence of a homeowner's association is very noticeable. As you enter, you'll encounter nothing but well-groomed single-family homes, which the HOA can take credit for. Front yards are standardized with small patches of grass, pebbles, and short driveways, and occasional small trees. Every home boasts a two-car garage. As you drive through the neighborhood, you'll notice newly paved roads that are well-maintained and free of any potholes. Although there are varying home types, most are single-story, with the occasional two-story house. We don't have the typical mailbox setup for single-family homes. Instead, there's a centralized mailbox system at the end of the street, with everyone using keys to access their specific mailbox. There are two larger lockers for packages, and again, this is thanks to the HOA's obsession with uniformity. My house is located on the outskirts of the nearby city, making our neighborhood a blend of rural and suburban. This gives us ample space for everything from community pools to walking trails. The area is primarily retired folks, but there are also a few middle-aged and young professionals. The city, while large in population, has a small-town feel. It offers most of the amenities you'd expect, including a single mall, which is not huge but gets the job done. It takes around 15 minutes to drive to any significant place, where you'll find a variety of stores, from high-end grocery stores offering organic food to bargain outlets with minimal staff to keep costs down. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical, with plenty of nice things like pools and walking trails. You might have to drive a bit to get to significant stores, but it's not a problem when you can access all major chains by car.",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that's just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, located on the east side, is the most economically disadvantaged part of the town. Property values are low, with most houses either rented to or owned by low-income individuals. Despite this, it's not an unpleasant place. Neighbors are generally friendly, often smiling and saying hello as I walk down the street. Crime rates are a bit higher than other parts of town, but they're still generally low. In the past decade, there have been a few violent crimes within a few blocks of my home, including shootings and at least one homicide. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a nearby bar last year. Our family hasn't been directly affected by crime, except for occasional items disappearing from our porch if we forget to bring them in. The town has been significantly impacted by the \"opioid epidemic,\" with many lives lost to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are resources to combat this, such as addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected. Despite these challenges, the town has many positive aspects. My son's elementary school is excellent, with a positive atmosphere that makes it a great place for him, even with special needs. The PTO plans various events to promote family involvement and education. Over 20% of the town's population lives below the poverty line, so the school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students. No child or family is treated poorly due to their financial situation, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are reasonable. The City Council has made improvements to the town's appearance, like repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing parks, but most of these improvements are on the west side and center of town, where most shopping areas are located. This has left the east side, where I live, neglected, which is a point of contention among my neighbors. Overall, I enjoy living here. People are friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options, and our home, while not valuable, is comfortable and satisfying. We've lived here for over 16 years and can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is rich with culture, nestled on a hill surrounded by historic buildings. I reside in a 7-story apartment across from an old live theater, while just a block down, a unique arcade bar draws diverse crowds on warm summer evenings, often creating long lines, especially during June and July. A few blocks away lies a sizable city park, encircled by concrete and tall stairs, which provide shelter for homeless individuals during the cold winter months. The rain, despite the lack of snow, can be harsh, making it challenging to stay warm. They've learned to huddle together around the city center, close to a family center where they can bathe and shower, all within walking distance.\n\nWhat I cherish about my neighborhood isn't the architectural beauty but the people's spirit. Hilltop was once notorious for gang violence, and echoes of those times still linger. The people here work hard to keep their streets clean, despite the neighborhood's rough reputation. They've passed down stories from generation to generation, even to newcomers like me, about the federal officials and the DEA sweeping through the streets.\n\nThe sense of community is palpable. Despite the warnings to avoid the Hill at night due to its racial undertones, I feel a deep connection. It's amazing how I've found people who are quick to offer help rather than harm. They've shown me kindness in unexpected moments, from accepting the help of a laundromat owner to having a stranger offer me $5 on a dreary night.\n\nThis place is more than just a home; it's a testament to people's resilience and the power of community. It's a place where I feel truly alive.",
            "I hail from the heart of Rural America, nestled in the peaceful small town of Michigan. Our town is a charming blend of farmland and quaint tourist cities, but you won't find any big city malls or chain stores like Wal-mart, Target, or Applebee’s. Everything requires a bit of a drive, but the effort is worth it for the breathtaking landscapes. We are surrounded by water, with Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix as our neighbors, offering plenty of beaches for a quick dip. Our neighborhood embodies the essence of small-town living. Houses are not crammed together but spread out, each with its own unique charm. Most homes have full basements visible from the road, and while some are modernized, others carry the charm of older architecture. Aluminum siding adorns many structures, with yards featuring trampolines, play sets, gardens, and fences for pets. Our neighbors are hardworking folks, either raising families or having raised them, and the community is close-knit. You'll see kids playing, dog walkers, and cyclists or rollerbladers. Neighbors greet one another, and lawns are well-maintained, free from fall leaves and with green grass kept under control. This isn't a neighborhood you drive into and are impressed by the homes' beauty, but one where you feel safe and comfortable. The local sheriff's department and jail are within walking distance, as is the health department, recycling center, and baseball and softball fields. The small-town airport is nearby, offering the sound of small planes taking off and landing. You can walk to the local ice cream shop, and even ride your bike to the park a few blocks away. It's peaceful, safe, and exceptional for its representation of a place where you can call home."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "My home is in a bustling metropolis where diversity is the norm. Residential zones are scattered amongst commercial areas, with businesses ranging from corporate offices to local stores and eateries. There's no shortage of new eateries and shops to explore. Larger, well-known brands rub shoulders with small boutiques that line the streets, often in walking distance of otherwise peaceful neighborhoods. Parks nearby have become popular hangout spots for locals and their kids. As for the people, my neighborhood is a melting pot of cultures. Within a small radius, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a group of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Further out, there are more communities representing various ethnicities, such as Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia. While they're just a few miles away, these communities are created for ease of access to cultural experiences and support. The city's size means that even a short 10-mile drive can take hours due to traffic, especially during peak hours. Very few people walk due to the city's vastness, leading to one of the world's worst traffic conditions and a scarcity of parking spots. Conversely, there's been a construction boom with new apartment buildings springing up, which is both a draw and a source of frustration for some residents who dread the influx of more people and vehicles. Residential areas offer a range of housing options, from single-family homes to duplexes and smaller apartment buildings. My neighborhood is no exception, providing a mix of housing types and ages. While I'm not familiar with most of my neighbors, I have fond childhood memories of playing with neighboring kids. It isn't a close-knit community anymore, but it was once a lively place for neighborhood playtime.",
            "My neighborhood has an interesting layout. Most of the homes are single-family, but a few have been converted into attached duplexes. My residence boasts a small front yard and a narrow driveway positioned to the left of the house. Like many others, it evokes a sense of the American dream from a bygone era, a dream that still resonates with those who live here, though the optimism has waned, and the upkeep of the yards has declined. Yet, there's still a car or two in almost every driveway, and children continue to play as if the world revolves around them. The long-standing public school, which has been here for nearly nine decades, still stirs hope in the youth and nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, most being empty, but the basketball courts remain filled with eager players. Each home may look different, but there's a sense of unity among them. A large supermarket named \"Super A,\" owned by a prominent Yemeni family, is the only such establishment in the neighborhood. The resident population is predominantly African American, with many families having roots in the area for generations. The streets are wide and kids play football, only pausing to let the cars pass. The neighborhood once had a karate school, which closed when karate's popularity wavered, and now operates as a pharmacy due to the perception that drugs can solve everything. There's also an old movie theater that shows classic films at a discounted price, a favorite among the elders who see it as a convenient night out, minus the kids. A single expressway runs through our town, but the nearby town has the exits and entrances. Despite a youth-led petition to bring one to our town, the elders' concerns about ruining the town's charm swayed the city council against the proposal. A new high school is under construction, and we're debating on a mascot. I suggest a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin to symbolize our town's unique identity.",
            "You might miss it by the looks of it - a residential area tucked behind a shopping strip, far from where one might expect to live. But if you venture behind the dilapidated Whole Foods and walk past the hotels that only spring to life during family reunions, you'll stumble upon a thriving community. Hidden within these neighborhoods, a few apartment complexes stand side by side, much like Russian nesting dolls that have been carefully disassembled and arranged in a row. The first ones you encounter may not paint a good picture, but the ones beside them and the ones after that reveal a different story. Across from these complexes, you'll find a community college's satellite campus, a quiet, peaceful oasis where students start their days with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning. The iron gates creak open to admit them, often causing commuters to shake their fists and groan at the traffic delays.

The center boasts cheerful porch furniture and a lazy ceiling fan that sweeps the warm summer air back and forth. Children race and play in the grass, bees buzz in the flower patches, and retirees walk their dogs, scowling at skateboarding teens and nodding to the girls gathered by the playground. Nearby, a sushi place in a strip mall offers affordable food, a sports store, and a nail salon. You could fill your pool while getting a manicure and enjoying hibachi chicken - the convenience of a strip mall. A DIY frozen yogurt shop serves up cold, sweet treats for the teens who flock to the park, clutching their toppings-covered cups as they perform tricks on their skateboards and vape.

            "The first thing you need to grasp about Portland, Oregon is its reputation for being quirky. The city's unofficial motto, found on a pizza joint and bar that serves as a music venue and strip club while occasionally pushing the boundaries, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this slogan is a reminder of the Portland from the 90s and early 2000s—a Portland that was less known and more affordable, fostering unique and creative subcultures. For others, it's an invitation to embrace Portland's embrace of the strange, where being called \"weird\" is a compliment. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the ongoing construction of condos to accommodate them, Portland remains peculiar. Being weird doesn't mean being accepting of everything but does mean accepting of things that are typically not welcomed. Weird doesn't mean we lack modern amenities and challenges; we, like the rest of the nation, source most of our goods from China. Portland offers a million ways to be weird, to be unusual, yet it also has plenty of normality—yoga classes, hipster enclaves, and business professionals. Maybe being weird just means we take all of this a bit less seriously. In my neighborhood, and many others in Portland, you'll see vibrant houses, home gardens with flowers, herbs, and vegetables, and free boxes during the summer. These free boxes are traditional cardboard boxes where people discard items, but they can also be plastic bags or boxes. They contain treasures—clothes, books, anything—perfect for the lucky passerby. The mystery of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is about to me, but I'm just one variety of weird among countless others. Some residents I live with would never pick clothes from a sidewalk box. They prefer goat yoga (yes, yoga with real goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is filled with people who love all sorts of things and pursue their dreams, or at least dream about pursuing them while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland faces a drug problem. Such issues often stem from mental health struggles, and the constant rain and gloomy skies may contribute to this. Portland also grapples with homelessness, which is challenging to address due to the lack of effective solutions across the country. The non-homeless population oscillates between empathy and hostility. In this, we're quite normal.",
            "The mountains stand tall, a constant sentinel in the north, greeting the sun's rise and fall with unyielding steadfastness. No matter how much I get caught up in life or forget about them, they are ever-present, unaffected by life's ups and downs. On days when I am most stressed, their silent strength calls out to me, offering solace and renewed resolve. I first moved here for my undergrad, and the mountains became my earliest fascination. Though the university has its own beauty, with stunning buildings, ponds, and trees, it's the mountains that hold my heart. The town itself is a mix of charming cafes and a bustling downtown area, where the energy of a city meets the serenity of a small town. This blend creates a unique atmosphere, as if the city is inviting exploration. Here, I've created memorable moments—from late-night chats with friends in the park to movie nights in the university’s fancy theater. Yet, it also holds harsh memories, as all places do. The ponds, particularly, have been a place of reflection and tears, especially during existential crises. Watching the wildlife live out their roles has made me question my own purpose, a struggle I have more experience with. I've walked past these reflective spots, through the park and suburban houses, until I reached a main street. With the sun shining on palm trees, I realized I was heading north. As the sun painted the sky, I saw the mountains, strong and stoic, guiding me with their silent strength. They stirred within me a sense of perseverance.",
            "If you are planning a visit to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you won't have trouble finding it! Public transportation is easily accessible and is one of the primary ways people travel in New York City. Bensonhurst is quite urban, so you'll still feel like you're in the heart of the city. Keep an eye out for the many Asian stores you'll see during your visit. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurst has seen a significant increase in its Asian population, with Asian-owned businesses such as supermarkets and laundromats on nearly every block. Locals appreciate the high-quality food and lower prices, and the convenience makes it a popular choice. In fact, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of each other near my place. Despite the prevalence of Asian businesses, Bensonhurst is diverse, with immigrants and their children making up a significant part of the population. Additionally, the neighborhood has a recently renovated park with numerous sports facilities, swings, and a playground, catering to various ages and preferences.\n\nWhile Bensonhurst isn't overrun with corporate buildings, it has co-op living spaces and condominium apartments. Most residents live in two-family houses, and while people are generally nice, noise can be an issue. Blasting music from cars and aggressive driving are common, which can make it challenging to get a good night's sleep. While Bensonhurst is relatively safe, it's important to stay alert, especially at night. There can be unpredictable individuals, including bullies and thieves. I've experienced physical assault and package theft in the past, and while it's not common anymore, it's good to be cautious. New York City has laws against leaving dog waste, but these rules aren't always followed here. In the morning, you might encounter dog waste on your way to the train station or supermarket. It's crucial to keep your shoes clean, as this can be quite bothersome.\n\nIn summary, Bensonhurst offers a mix of Asian and diverse communities with convenient shopping options and a well-equipped park. However, noise and occasional incidents of theft and littering are drawbacks to be aware of during your visit.",
            "The sidewalks around my neighborhood are scarce, with my house perched right at the top of the steepest hill. Joggers fondly refer to it as the \"work out hill,\" but the lack of sidewalks means everyone walks on the road, which can be quite treacherous. The road is filled with potholes and the sight of telephone and electric wires strung up in a tattered state. We get heavy rainfall and storms frequently here, which often brings down branches and debris, leaving the wires looking worn and patched. Towering evergreen trees surround the area, but they're not popular with the locals who try to cut them down as they obstruct the view of the ocean. Many homes are built high up on the hill with large glass-fronted second stories to take advantage of the view. At sunset, the water seems to glow from below, and the sky turns a beautiful orange. However, the weather is often overcast and damp, with moss growing on practically everything, including my car which turned green and furry after being left in my driveway for a month. There are more dogs than children in the neighborhood, and many of the people are older, with retirees making up a significant portion. Instead of kids, people have pets. Rabbits also run wild in the area, digging up gardens and burrowing in lawns, much to the delight of my cats. We also have an array of birds, from small sparrows and hummingbirds to occasional hawks or eagles that are usually chased off by neighborhood crows. There are no stores nearby, but a short hike down to the waterfront has a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. The beach isn't particularly big, but the rocks along the shore are enjoyable to toss into the water. The bay is quite narrow, allowing you to see the opposite shoreline clearly through the mist on most days.",
            "I reside in a typical suburban setting of a small southern town in Tennessee. Our street serves as a connector between two state highways, which leads to a bit more traffic than I'd prefer, but otherwise, it's a quiet neighborhood. The influx of new residents is minimal, so I've grown accustomed to most of my neighbors. They usually keep busy with yard work and daily chores. In the winter, we hit the slopes on our side street. Our home is situated at the corner, allowing us to observe everyone coming and going throughout the day. We're accustomed to the vehicles that frequent our street; any strange ones catch our attention. Some neighbors take leisurely walks or walk their dogs. Kids ride their bikes, and it's all quite typical. We work from home, so we're often seen around the neighborhood. There are four of us in the family: myself, my wife, and our two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen. People are familiar with us coming and going, and we often engage in outdoor activities, even in the rain. On occasion, we enjoy grilling on our back deck, with the pleasant aroma of the barbecue filling the air. The lawn mowers are a constant presence from March through October, the grass growing season. The neighborhood is quite wooded, providing ample shade, but it means regular leaf raking and burning in the fall, which I find enjoyable. Winter has been mild, extending the fall season. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we seldom use the front door unless someone knocks, which is infrequent. I often work in the garage, tinkering with my truck or other projects, feeling more connected to the neighborhood when the garage door is open. Holidays like Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, and Christmas see extra visitors, with additional cars parked around the neighborhood. Overall, I appreciate living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be ideal.",
            "My neighborhood is smack dab in the middle of the high desert, a place where dirt, dirt, and more dirt reign supreme. Unless you've lived here, it's hard to comprehend the constant sight of brown landscapes, and even when you see a lawn, you know its owner is spending a fortune on lawn care. Back in the 90s, this place was dotted with houses scattered far and wide; now, it's still the same, but with many new additions. It's slowly transforming into a city, with its friendly and not-so-friendly aspects. I'm surrounded by senior citizens who make this neighborhood feel like a pleasant place to live. The stores here are mostly chains, like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final, with very few local or upscale options. The most common jobs here are in construction, as this city is still largely undeveloped and open for building. This makes me a bit nervous, as I prefer this place the way it is. I left the big city and I'm not eager to return. My job, as a drywall and T-bar installer, is in this field. I love the diverse wildlife here. People visit for the stark beauty of the desert and the challenging ecosystems it creates. Learning about the non-human residents who share this environment is crucial for safe coexistence. My family has embraced this wildlife; my three children are fascinated by lizards and desert bugs. Attractions include the annual San Bernardino County Fair in Victorville and the snow-covered mountains in nearby Wrightwood, which offer a unique desert experience. The Victor Valley Museum showcases the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem, with geological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical items telling the story of Victorville's development.",
            "I'd say my neighborhood is a bit unique compared to what others might be used to. While others might be describing their own homes and immediate surroundings, I'm talking about the college campus where I reside. The people living in my dormitory are my community, and the campus grounds are my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser degree. Despite this, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with traditional ones, such as having houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's dive into the \"houses\" in my neighborhood first. To start, there are three types of housing here: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory houses. Apartments house between 2-4 people per room, each floor has about 4-6 rooms, with the most common buildings having 2 floors, accommodating around 20 people per building. Actual houses are usually 2-4 bedrooms and are rented by school affiliates, but they're less common. Lastly, dorm rooms are the norm, with 100s of students living here, each room usually housing 2 people, with the exception of some. Moving on to the people, my school's diversity is reflected in my neighborhood. We have people of all cultures and ages. Professionals like staff live in affiliate houses, newer students in dorms, and older students in apartments. Discussing the people in depth would be unfair, so let's move on to the stores and parks. My school is a self-contained neighborhood, boasting a variety of stores and a single park. The stores offer dining options and the school's unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. Need anything? It's within reach! The park is a playground for all and kept clean and safe by the neighborhood's members.",
            "I've been living in this neighborhood for nearly a decade now, and I've got a story or two to share. Initially, moving from Riverdale to Stockbridge wasn't easy. I was devastated, missing the familiar faces and places, but my parents had our best interests at heart, so we moved for better housing and a top-notch high school. Over time, I made new friends and some new acquaintances too, but the ones who stand out are Mr. Glen and his family, and Dennis, our neighbors. They've become like family to me, and I truly appreciate their company. I remember attending Mr. Glen's re-marriage - an enjoyable event where I caught Ms. Veda's bouquet strap! I wish I'd caught the flowers too. Dancing the night away with Marsharii, his daughter, was a blast. I haven't seen her since, but I hope she's doing well. This neighborhood is a bit of a maze, but with GPS, I can explore more. I've hung out with friends Kason and Curtis, playing video games and enjoying life to the fullest. Sometimes, I just head to the park for some peace and tranquility. I'll practice my balancing tricks with sticks from Home Depot and bring my bokken wooden sword for fun. There's a basketball and tennis court too, though I haven't played in a while. My dad and Mr. Graves used to toughen us up with tennis; we always had a great time, even if it was challenging. This neighborhood has plenty of great memories, and I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood's close to the college I attend, so I enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are a fun, affordable spot. One bar just got a new name; it's pricier but the service and drinks are decent. Most locals are either college kids or lower income, given the cheaper rent. Kids are nearby since there's an elementary school close by. I don't know my neighbors, and they're quite the smokers, which led management to put an air freshener near their door, a funny but almost insulting move. The buildings around me are old but have been renovated. Down the street, there are newly built apartments, but their quality isn't great, despite the expensive rent. Across from a cheap, paper-plate restaurant and a questionable gas station, the area's improved thanks to city money. Trees surround my apartment complex, with a few stumps, but more trees than the road behind. My street, 42nd, is nicer than 43rd, which has falling apart sidewalks and shabby buildings. Crime's happened around here, and some neighboring apartments have a transient population. But I like it; it's affordable and convenient. The university is nearby, and there are two bus stops for easy shopping and downtown trips.",
            "My neighborhood is comprised of duplexes on a cul-de-sac, scattered in such a way that they resemble individual houses. Every home is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs, and almost everyone knows each other. We often gather at the end of a not-so-planned driveway, chatting while the neighborhood kids play with their toys, sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. It's incredibly refreshing, a stark contrast to our modern, tech-filled world. We're surrounded by fields and trees, enhanced by a clear blue sky and fluffy white clouds. The only bummer? This season has brought tornado warnings, and last night we heard the sirens for the first time. I found myself in my bathtub with my smallest dog, some pillows, and my purse. My bigger dog refused to join us and stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The neighborhood was eerily quiet except for the sound of heavy hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road was steaming from the temperature change, dropping from 92 degrees to 75 in minutes. The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement. As I looked up, the sky cleared and it started to rain, revealing a double rainbow. I rushed inside, grabbed my camera, and snapped photos to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were as awestruck as I was. The streets remained quiet for an hour before some people started to return home. Then it was back to normal, with moms and kids playing outside while dinner cooked. It's a welcoming neighborhood for this gal who's newly moved from NH to NC. I have a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, as do my neighbors. Despite the uniformity on the outside, the interiors vary greatly in size. Some are incredibly small, which doesn't make sense to me. I enjoy taking leisurely walks along the biggest field behind my home and heading down to the non-swimmable pond. I've spotted deer there, and in the morning, you can hear a massive bullfrog serenading. It's a fantastic place to live, just a forty-minute drive from Charlotte. Each morning is greeted by the sound of roosters crowing from nearby farms. It's like living in a small, self-contained community. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that brays in the evening to announce his presence. I'm fortunate to have found such a gem of a neighborhood.",
            "I arrived in this neighborhood on the cusp of starting eighth grade. Initially, making friends was challenging, but I soon became close with someone living two houses down and another guy on my street. Though they no longer reside here, the memories remain. Many of the original residents are still around, so it feels like home. Our neighborhood is quite typical of an American suburb, complete with two-story houses. Weekends and warm days are filled with the sound of kids playing outside. Weekdays are quieter, and I've never encountered any issues with my neighbors. I trust them enough to leave packages on my porch without fear of theft. A park just a minute or two away holds many memories of basketball, football, and baseball games with the neighborhood kids. One of my fondest memories is playing football there, though I did suffer a nose injury from an elbow. The park now serves as a place for me to spend time with my cousin's young kids, who love playing on the swings and slides. The park brings back feelings of nostalgia. Diversity is abundant in our neighborhood, with a plethora of restaurants within a mile radius. You can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian cuisine. Many folks use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for delivery. Fast food and pizza places are also plentiful, as they are in most suburban neighborhoods. The stores here have everything you could need, including a variety of dry cleaners, Walgreens, CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store. There's even an Indian-owned store for those craving homemade or ready-made Indian food. Overall, I'm grateful for our neighborhood, especially when I read about the challenges other people face with their neighbors on social media and in the news.",
            "My hometown, Johnston in South Carolina, is a charming little place that's not much different from others in the area, but it's got a significant role in the state's agriculture sector. It's proudly known as the Peach Capital of the World, a title it boasts on its welcoming sign. The landscape is dominated by farmland, either filled with peach trees or cattle. Houses are spaced out, usually two-story structures with either metal roofs to withstand the scorching heat or gray shingles. These homes are often located away from the road, allowing the front fields to be used for farming or livestock. In the heart of town, there's a single stoplight at the four-way intersection where the only stores are located. There are three \"fast food\" options: Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family; Fiesta Mexican Restaurant; and Gary's, a small burger chain. A pizzeria closed down recently. There's also Maxwell and Halford Drug, a small family-owned pharmacy that's famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola. The Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, is the only grocery store, but many residents prefer to shop at a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for most of their groceries. Dollar General is the most popular store, bustling from opening to closing time. Possibilities Furniture & More is a small furniture store run by a well-known community member. Attached to it is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, where you can find daycare, boarding, grooming, and other pet care services. Both a doctor's and a veterinary practice are located away from the main part of town, both are small but well-equipped to serve the town's residents. Johnston Elementary School is the only school in town, but once students reach fifth grade, they must attend middle and high school in the next town over. There are no parks, but a 2.5-acre recreational area is in the works to provide families with more outing opportunities and attract visitors. Despite the lack of entertainment options like movie theaters, bowling alleys, or playgrounds, it's a nice town, so small you can pass through without noticing in the blink of an eye!",
            "The first time I heard about my place, it was while listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a bit surprising, given that the rent here is over a thousand dollars a month. None of my friends or I had any idea about this, so maybe it's just the struggle we're in. I know some friends cry themselves to sleep at night because of the cost. We've learned to be frugal over the years. You start to appreciate the unique smell of flea market toys and used clothes. The adult world is full of that dusty smell. Some people might take up smoking, or they might just get used to the way things are. But the flea market is always there. It's a place where you can spend an afternoon and hear nothing but silence. There are three thrift stores within walking distance, and you can also find a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop if you walk a little farther. Downtown is bustling with people and cars every morning, but it's surprisingly quiet in the thrift stores. It reminders me of New York. Everyone's on their own agenda, and no one asks much of you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and no one will bother you. It's not like the South, where just being polite means you care. You don't pry into other people's lives here. You can keep to yourself as much as you like, and the city will continue on just fine. It's a lively place to be. The pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs make sure of that. We have a sense of community here, helping each other out when we need it. I've made some great neighbors, and they're kind enough to leave me food and help with my mail. I even like most of them. It's not just a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl; it's the people that make it feel like a home.",
            "The region where I live can be considered your run-of-the-mill cookie-cutter suburb. The presence of a homeowner's association is very noticeable. As you enter, you'll encounter nothing but well-groomed single-family homes, which the HOA can take credit for. Front yards are standardized with small patches of grass, pebbles, and short driveways, and occasional small trees. Every home boasts a two-car garage. As you drive through the neighborhood, you'll notice newly paved roads that are well-maintained and free of any potholes. Although there are varying home types, most are single-story, with the occasional two-story house. We don't have the typical mailbox setup for single-family homes. Instead, there's a centralized mailbox system at the end of the street, with everyone using keys to access their specific mailbox. There are two larger lockers for packages, and again, this is thanks to the HOA's obsession with uniformity. My house is located on the outskirts of the nearby city, making our neighborhood a blend of rural and suburban. This gives us ample space for everything from community pools to walking trails. The area is primarily retired folks, but there are also a few middle-aged and young professionals. The city, while large in population, has a small-town feel. It offers most of the amenities you'd expect, including a single mall, which is not huge but gets the job done. It takes around 15 minutes to drive to any significant place, where you'll find a variety of stores, from high-end grocery stores offering organic food to bargain outlets with minimal staff to keep costs down. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical, with plenty of nice things like pools and walking trails. You might have to drive a bit to get to significant stores, but it's not a problem when you can access all major chains by car.",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that's just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, located on the east side, is the most economically disadvantaged part of the town. Property values are low, with most houses either rented to or owned by low-income individuals. Despite this, it's not an unpleasant place. Neighbors are generally friendly, often smiling and saying hello as I walk down the street. Crime rates are a bit higher than other parts of town, but they're still generally low. In the past decade, there have been a few violent crimes within a few blocks of my home, including shootings and at least one homicide. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a nearby bar last year. Our family hasn't been directly affected by crime, except for occasional items disappearing from our porch if we forget to bring them in. The town has been significantly impacted by the \"opioid epidemic,\" with many lives lost to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are resources to combat this, such as addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected. Despite these challenges, the town has many positive aspects. My son's elementary school is excellent, with a positive atmosphere that makes it a great place for him, even with special needs. The PTO plans various events to promote family involvement and education. Over 20% of the town's population lives below the poverty line, so the school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students. No child or family is treated poorly due to their financial situation, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are reasonable. The City Council has made improvements to the town's appearance, like repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing parks, but most of these improvements are on the west side and center of town, where most shopping areas are located. This has left the east side, where I live, neglected, which is a point of contention among my neighbors. Overall, I enjoy living here. People are friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options, and our home, while not valuable, is comfortable and satisfying. We've lived here for over 16 years and can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is rich with culture, nestled on a hill surrounded by historic buildings. I reside in a 7-story apartment across from an old live theater, while just a block down, a unique arcade bar draws diverse crowds on warm summer evenings, often creating long lines, especially during June and July. A few blocks away lies a sizable city park, encircled by concrete and tall stairs, which provide shelter for homeless individuals during the cold winter months. The rain, despite the lack of snow, can be harsh, making it challenging to stay warm. They've learned to huddle together around the city center, close to a family center where they can bathe and shower, all within walking distance.\n\nWhat I cherish about my neighborhood isn't the architectural beauty but the people's spirit. Hilltop was once notorious for gang violence, and echoes of those times still linger. The people here work hard to keep their streets clean, despite the neighborhood's rough reputation. They've passed down stories from generation to generation, even to newcomers like me, about the federal officials and the DEA sweeping through the streets.\n\nThe sense of community is palpable. Despite the warnings to avoid the Hill at night due to its racial undertones, I feel a deep connection. It's amazing how I've found people who are quick to offer help rather than harm. They've shown me kindness in unexpected moments, from accepting the help of a laundromat owner to having a stranger offer me $5 on a dreary night.\n\nThis place is more than just a home; it's a testament to people's resilience and the power of community. It's a place where I feel truly alive.",
            "I hail from the heart of Rural America, nestled in the peaceful small town of Michigan. Our town is a charming blend of farmland and quaint tourist cities, but you won't find any big city malls or chain stores like Wal-mart, Target, or Applebee’s. Everything requires a bit of a drive, but the effort is worth it for the breathtaking landscapes. We are surrounded by water, with Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix as our neighbors, offering plenty of beaches for a quick dip. Our neighborhood embodies the essence of small-town living. Houses are not crammed together but spread out, each with its own unique charm. Most homes have full basements visible from the road, and while some are modernized, others carry the charm of older architecture. Aluminum siding adorns many structures, with yards featuring trampolines, play sets, gardens, and fences for pets. Our neighbors are hardworking folks, either raising families or having raised them, and the community is close-knit. You'll see kids playing, dog walkers, and cyclists or rollerbladers. Neighbors greet one another, and lawns are well-maintained, free from fall leaves and with green grass kept under control. This isn't a neighborhood you drive into and are impressed by the homes' beauty, but one where you feel safe and comfortable. The local sheriff's department and jail are within walking distance, as is the health department, recycling center, and baseball and softball fields. The small-town airport is nearby, offering the sound of small planes taking off and landing. You can walk to the local ice cream shop, and even ride your bike to the park a few blocks away. It's peaceful, safe, and exceptional for its representation of a place where you can call home."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "My home is in a bustling metropolis where diversity is the norm. Residential zones are scattered amongst commercial areas, with businesses ranging from corporate offices to local stores and eateries. There's no shortage of new eateries and shops to explore. Larger, well-known brands rub shoulders with small boutiques that line the streets, often in walking distance of otherwise peaceful neighborhoods. Parks nearby have become popular hangout spots for locals and their kids. As for the people, my neighborhood is a melting pot of cultures. Within a small radius, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a group of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Further out, there are more communities representing various ethnicities, such as Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia. While they're just a few miles away, these communities are created for ease of access to cultural experiences and support. The city's size means that even a short 10-mile drive can take hours due to traffic, especially during peak hours. Very few people walk due to the city's vastness, leading to one of the world's worst traffic conditions and a scarcity of parking spots. Conversely, there's been a construction boom with new apartment buildings springing up, which is both a draw and a source of frustration for some residents who dread the influx of more people and vehicles. Residential areas offer a range of housing options, from single-family homes to duplexes and smaller apartment buildings. My neighborhood is no exception, providing a mix of housing types and ages. While I'm not familiar with most of my neighbors, I have fond childhood memories of playing with neighboring kids. It isn't a close-knit community anymore, but it was once a lively place for neighborhood playtime.",
            "My neighborhood has an interesting layout. Most of the homes are single-family, but a few have been converted into attached duplexes. My residence boasts a small front yard and a narrow driveway positioned to the left of the house. Like many others, it evokes a sense of the American dream from a bygone era, a dream that still resonates with those who live here, though the optimism has waned, and the upkeep of the yards has declined. Yet, there's still a car or two in almost every driveway, and children continue to play as if the world revolves around them. The long-standing public school, which has been here for nearly nine decades, still stirs hope in the youth and nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, most being empty, but the basketball courts remain filled with eager players. Each home may look different, but there's a sense of unity among them. A large supermarket named \"Super A,\" owned by a prominent Yemeni family, is the only such establishment in the neighborhood. The resident population is predominantly African American, with many families having roots in the area for generations. The streets are wide and kids play football, only pausing to let the cars pass. The neighborhood once had a karate school, which closed when karate's popularity wavered, and now operates as a pharmacy due to the perception that drugs can solve everything. There's also an old movie theater that shows classic films at a discounted price, a favorite among the elders who see it as a convenient night out, minus the kids. A single expressway runs through our town, but the nearby town has the exits and entrances. Despite a youth-led petition to bring one to our town, the elders' concerns about ruining the town's charm swayed the city council against the proposal. A new high school is under construction, and we're debating on a mascot. I suggest a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin to symbolize our town's unique identity.",

But if you venture behind the dilapidated Whole Foods and walk past the hotels that only spring to life during family reunions, you'll stumble upon a thriving community. Hidden within these neighborhoods, a few apartment complexes stand side by side, much like Russian nesting dolls that have been carefully disassembled and arranged in a row.

            "The first thing you need to grasp about Portland, Oregon is its reputation for being quirky. The city's unofficial motto, found on a pizza joint and bar that serves as a music venue and strip club while occasionally pushing the boundaries, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this slogan is a reminder of the Portland from the 90s and early 2000s—a Portland that was less known and more affordable, fostering unique and creative subcultures. For others, it's an invitation to embrace Portland's embrace of the strange, where being called \"weird\" is a compliment. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the ongoing construction of condos to accommodate them, Portland remains peculiar. Being weird doesn't mean being accepting of everything but does mean accepting of things that are typically not welcomed. Weird doesn't mean we lack modern amenities and challenges; we, like the rest of the nation, source most of our goods from China. Portland offers a million ways to be weird, to be unusual, yet it also has plenty of normality—yoga classes, hipster enclaves, and business professionals. Maybe being weird just means we take all of this a bit less seriously. In my neighborhood, and many others in Portland, you'll see vibrant houses, home gardens with flowers, herbs, and vegetables, and free boxes during the summer. These free boxes are traditional cardboard boxes where people discard items, but they can also be plastic bags or boxes. They contain treasures—clothes, books, anything—perfect for the lucky passerby. The mystery of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is about to me, but I'm just one variety of weird among countless others. Some residents I live with would never pick clothes from a sidewalk box. They prefer goat yoga (yes, yoga with real goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is filled with people who love all sorts of things and pursue their dreams, or at least dream about pursuing them while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland faces a drug problem. Such issues often stem from mental health struggles, and the constant rain and gloomy skies may contribute to this. Portland also grapples with homelessness, which is challenging to address due to the lack of effective solutions across the country. The non-homeless population oscillates between empathy and hostility. In this, we're quite normal.",
            "The mountains stand tall, a constant sentinel in the north, greeting the sun's rise and fall with unyielding steadfastness. No matter how much I get caught up in life or forget about them, they are ever-present, unaffected by life's ups and downs. On days when I am most stressed, their silent strength calls out to me, offering solace and renewed resolve. I first moved here for my undergrad, and the mountains became my earliest fascination. Though the university has its own beauty, with stunning buildings, ponds, and trees, it's the mountains that hold my heart. The town itself is a mix of charming cafes and a bustling downtown area, where the energy of a city meets the serenity of a small town. This blend creates a unique atmosphere, as if the city is inviting exploration. Here, I've created memorable moments—from late-night chats with friends in the park to movie nights in the university’s fancy theater. Yet, it also holds harsh memories, as all places do. The ponds, particularly, have been a place of reflection and tears, especially during existential crises. Watching the wildlife live out their roles has made me question my own purpose, a struggle I have more experience with. I've walked past these reflective spots, through the park and suburban houses, until I reached a main street. With the sun shining on palm trees, I realized I was heading north. As the sun painted the sky, I saw the mountains, strong and stoic, guiding me with their silent strength. They stirred within me a sense of perseverance.",
            "If you are planning a visit to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you won't have trouble finding it! Public transportation is easily accessible and is one of the primary ways people travel in New York City. Bensonhurst is quite urban, so you'll still feel like you're in the heart of the city. Keep an eye out for the many Asian stores you'll see during your visit. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurst has seen a significant increase in its Asian population, with Asian-owned businesses such as supermarkets and laundromats on nearly every block. Locals appreciate the high-quality food and lower prices, and the convenience makes it a popular choice. In fact, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of each other near my place. Despite the prevalence of Asian businesses, Bensonhurst is diverse, with immigrants and their children making up a significant part of the population. Additionally, the neighborhood has a recently renovated park with numerous sports facilities, swings, and a playground, catering to various ages and preferences.\n\nWhile Bensonhurst isn't overrun with corporate buildings, it has co-op living spaces and condominium apartments. Most residents live in two-family houses, and while people are generally nice, noise can be an issue. Blasting music from cars and aggressive driving are common, which can make it challenging to get a good night's sleep. While Bensonhurst is relatively safe, it's important to stay alert, especially at night. There can be unpredictable individuals, including bullies and thieves. I've experienced physical assault and package theft in the past, and while it's not common anymore, it's good to be cautious. New York City has laws against leaving dog waste, but these rules aren't always followed here. In the morning, you might encounter dog waste on your way to the train station or supermarket. It's crucial to keep your shoes clean, as this can be quite bothersome.\n\nIn summary, Bensonhurst offers a mix of Asian and diverse communities with convenient shopping options and a well-equipped park. However, noise and occasional incidents of theft and littering are drawbacks to be aware of during your visit.",
            "The sidewalks around my neighborhood are scarce, with my house perched right at the top of the steepest hill. Joggers fondly refer to it as the \"work out hill,\" but the lack of sidewalks means everyone walks on the road, which can be quite treacherous. The road is filled with potholes and the sight of telephone and electric wires strung up in a tattered state. We get heavy rainfall and storms frequently here, which often brings down branches and debris, leaving the wires looking worn and patched. Towering evergreen trees surround the area, but they're not popular with the locals who try to cut them down as they obstruct the view of the ocean. Many homes are built high up on the hill with large glass-fronted second stories to take advantage of the view. At sunset, the water seems to glow from below, and the sky turns a beautiful orange. However, the weather is often overcast and damp, with moss growing on practically everything, including my car which turned green and furry after being left in my driveway for a month. There are more dogs than children in the neighborhood, and many of the people are older, with retirees making up a significant portion. Instead of kids, people have pets. Rabbits also run wild in the area, digging up gardens and burrowing in lawns, much to the delight of my cats. We also have an array of birds, from small sparrows and hummingbirds to occasional hawks or eagles that are usually chased off by neighborhood crows. There are no stores nearby, but a short hike down to the waterfront has a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. The beach isn't particularly big, but the rocks along the shore are enjoyable to toss into the water. The bay is quite narrow, allowing you to see the opposite shoreline clearly through the mist on most days.",
            "I reside in a typical suburban setting of a small southern town in Tennessee. Our street serves as a connector between two state highways, which leads to a bit more traffic than I'd prefer, but otherwise, it's a quiet neighborhood. The influx of new residents is minimal, so I've grown accustomed to most of my neighbors. They usually keep busy with yard work and daily chores. In the winter, we hit the slopes on our side street. Our home is situated at the corner, allowing us to observe everyone coming and going throughout the day. We're accustomed to the vehicles that frequent our street; any strange ones catch our attention. Some neighbors take leisurely walks or walk their dogs. Kids ride their bikes, and it's all quite typical. We work from home, so we're often seen around the neighborhood. There are four of us in the family: myself, my wife, and our two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen. People are familiar with us coming and going, and we often engage in outdoor activities, even in the rain. On occasion, we enjoy grilling on our back deck, with the pleasant aroma of the barbecue filling the air. The lawn mowers are a constant presence from March through October, the grass growing season. The neighborhood is quite wooded, providing ample shade, but it means regular leaf raking and burning in the fall, which I find enjoyable. Winter has been mild, extending the fall season. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we seldom use the front door unless someone knocks, which is infrequent. I often work in the garage, tinkering with my truck or other projects, feeling more connected to the neighborhood when the garage door is open. Holidays like Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, and Christmas see extra visitors, with additional cars parked around the neighborhood. Overall, I appreciate living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be ideal.",
            "My neighborhood is smack dab in the middle of the high desert, a place where dirt, dirt, and more dirt reign supreme. Unless you've lived here, it's hard to comprehend the constant sight of brown landscapes, and even when you see a lawn, you know its owner is spending a fortune on lawn care. Back in the 90s, this place was dotted with houses scattered far and wide; now, it's still the same, but with many new additions. It's slowly transforming into a city, with its friendly and not-so-friendly aspects. I'm surrounded by senior citizens who make this neighborhood feel like a pleasant place to live. The stores here are mostly chains, like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final, with very few local or upscale options. The most common jobs here are in construction, as this city is still largely undeveloped and open for building. This makes me a bit nervous, as I prefer this place the way it is. I left the big city and I'm not eager to return. My job, as a drywall and T-bar installer, is in this field. I love the diverse wildlife here. People visit for the stark beauty of the desert and the challenging ecosystems it creates. Learning about the non-human residents who share this environment is crucial for safe coexistence. My family has embraced this wildlife; my three children are fascinated by lizards and desert bugs. Attractions include the annual San Bernardino County Fair in Victorville and the snow-covered mountains in nearby Wrightwood, which offer a unique desert experience. The Victor Valley Museum showcases the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem, with geological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical items telling the story of Victorville's development.",
            "I'd say my neighborhood is a bit unique compared to what others might be used to. While others might be describing their own homes and immediate surroundings, I'm talking about the college campus where I reside. The people living in my dormitory are my community, and the campus grounds are my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser degree. Despite this, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with traditional ones, such as having houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's dive into the \"houses\" in my neighborhood first. To start, there are three types of housing here: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory houses. Apartments house between 2-4 people per room, each floor has about 4-6 rooms, with the most common buildings having 2 floors, accommodating around 20 people per building. Actual houses are usually 2-4 bedrooms and are rented by school affiliates, but they're less common. Lastly, dorm rooms are the norm, with 100s of students living here, each room usually housing 2 people, with the exception of some. Moving on to the people, my school's diversity is reflected in my neighborhood. We have people of all cultures and ages. Professionals like staff live in affiliate houses, newer students in dorms, and older students in apartments. Discussing the people in depth would be unfair, so let's move on to the stores and parks. My school is a self-contained neighborhood, boasting a variety of stores and a single park. The stores offer dining options and the school's unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. Need anything? It's within reach! The park is a playground for all and kept clean and safe by the neighborhood's members.",
            "I've been living in this neighborhood for nearly a decade now, and I've got a story or two to share. Initially, moving from Riverdale to Stockbridge wasn't easy. I was devastated, missing the familiar faces and places, but my parents had our best interests at heart, so we moved for better housing and a top-notch high school. Over time, I made new friends and some new acquaintances too, but the ones who stand out are Mr. Glen and his family, and Dennis, our neighbors. They've become like family to me, and I truly appreciate their company. I remember attending Mr. Glen's re-marriage - an enjoyable event where I caught Ms. Veda's bouquet strap! I wish I'd caught the flowers too. Dancing the night away with Marsharii, his daughter, was a blast. I haven't seen her since, but I hope she's doing well. This neighborhood is a bit of a maze, but with GPS, I can explore more. I've hung out with friends Kason and Curtis, playing video games and enjoying life to the fullest. Sometimes, I just head to the park for some peace and tranquility. I'll practice my balancing tricks with sticks from Home Depot and bring my bokken wooden sword for fun. There's a basketball and tennis court too, though I haven't played in a while. My dad and Mr. Graves used to toughen us up with tennis; we always had a great time, even if it was challenging. This neighborhood has plenty of great memories, and I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood's close to the college I attend, so I enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are a fun, affordable spot. One bar just got a new name; it's pricier but the service and drinks are decent. Most locals are either college kids or lower income, given the cheaper rent. Kids are nearby since there's an elementary school close by. I don't know my neighbors, and they're quite the smokers, which led management to put an air freshener near their door, a funny but almost insulting move. The buildings around me are old but have been renovated. Down the street, there are newly built apartments, but their quality isn't great, despite the expensive rent. Across from a cheap, paper-plate restaurant and a questionable gas station, the area's improved thanks to city money. Trees surround my apartment complex, with a few stumps, but more trees than the road behind. My street, 42nd, is nicer than 43rd, which has falling apart sidewalks and shabby buildings. Crime's happened around here, and some neighboring apartments have a transient population. But I like it; it's affordable and convenient. The university is nearby, and there are two bus stops for easy shopping and downtown trips.",
            "My neighborhood is comprised of duplexes on a cul-de-sac, scattered in such a way that they resemble individual houses. Every home is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs, and almost everyone knows each other. We often gather at the end of a not-so-planned driveway, chatting while the neighborhood kids play with their toys, sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. It's incredibly refreshing, a stark contrast to our modern, tech-filled world. We're surrounded by fields and trees, enhanced by a clear blue sky and fluffy white clouds. The only bummer? This season has brought tornado warnings, and last night we heard the sirens for the first time. I found myself in my bathtub with my smallest dog, some pillows, and my purse. My bigger dog refused to join us and stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The neighborhood was eerily quiet except for the sound of heavy hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road was steaming from the temperature change, dropping from 92 degrees to 75 in minutes. The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement. As I looked up, the sky cleared and it started to rain, revealing a double rainbow. I rushed inside, grabbed my camera, and snapped photos to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were as awestruck as I was. The streets remained quiet for an hour before some people started to return home. Then it was back to normal, with moms and kids playing outside while dinner cooked. It's a welcoming neighborhood for this gal who's newly moved from NH to NC. I have a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, as do my neighbors. Despite the uniformity on the outside, the interiors vary greatly in size. Some are incredibly small, which doesn't make sense to me. I enjoy taking leisurely walks along the biggest field behind my home and heading down to the non-swimmable pond. I've spotted deer there, and in the morning, you can hear a massive bullfrog serenading. It's a fantastic place to live, just a forty-minute drive from Charlotte. Each morning is greeted by the sound of roosters crowing from nearby farms. It's like living in a small, self-contained community. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that brays in the evening to announce his presence. I'm fortunate to have found such a gem of a neighborhood.",
            "I arrived in this neighborhood on the cusp of starting eighth grade. Initially, making friends was challenging, but I soon became close with someone living two houses down and another guy on my street. Though they no longer reside here, the memories remain. Many of the original residents are still around, so it feels like home. Our neighborhood is quite typical of an American suburb, complete with two-story houses. Weekends and warm days are filled with the sound of kids playing outside. Weekdays are quieter, and I've never encountered any issues with my neighbors. I trust them enough to leave packages on my porch without fear of theft. A park just a minute or two away holds many memories of basketball, football, and baseball games with the neighborhood kids. One of my fondest memories is playing football there, though I did suffer a nose injury from an elbow. The park now serves as a place for me to spend time with my cousin's young kids, who love playing on the swings and slides. The park brings back feelings of nostalgia. Diversity is abundant in our neighborhood, with a plethora of restaurants within a mile radius. You can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian cuisine. Many folks use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for delivery. Fast food and pizza places are also plentiful, as they are in most suburban neighborhoods. The stores here have everything you could need, including a variety of dry cleaners, Walgreens, CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store. There's even an Indian-owned store for those craving homemade or ready-made Indian food. Overall, I'm grateful for our neighborhood, especially when I read about the challenges other people face with their neighbors on social media and in the news.",
            "My hometown, Johnston in South Carolina, is a charming little place that's not much different from others in the area, but it's got a significant role in the state's agriculture sector. It's proudly known as the Peach Capital of the World, a title it boasts on its welcoming sign. The landscape is dominated by farmland, either filled with peach trees or cattle. Houses are spaced out, usually two-story structures with either metal roofs to withstand the scorching heat or gray shingles. These homes are often located away from the road, allowing the front fields to be used for farming or livestock. In the heart of town, there's a single stoplight at the four-way intersection where the only stores are located. There are three \"fast food\" options: Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family; Fiesta Mexican Restaurant; and Gary's, a small burger chain. A pizzeria closed down recently. There's also Maxwell and Halford Drug, a small family-owned pharmacy that's famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola. The Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, is the only grocery store, but many residents prefer to shop at a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for most of their groceries. Dollar General is the most popular store, bustling from opening to closing time. Possibilities Furniture & More is a small furniture store run by a well-known community member. Attached to it is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, where you can find daycare, boarding, grooming, and other pet care services. Both a doctor's and a veterinary practice are located away from the main part of town, both are small but well-equipped to serve the town's residents. Johnston Elementary School is the only school in town, but once students reach fifth grade, they must attend middle and high school in the next town over. There are no parks, but a 2.5-acre recreational area is in the works to provide families with more outing opportunities and attract visitors. Despite the lack of entertainment options like movie theaters, bowling alleys, or playgrounds, it's a nice town, so small you can pass through without noticing in the blink of an eye!",
            "The first time I heard about my place, it was while listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a bit surprising, given that the rent here is over a thousand dollars a month. None of my friends or I had any idea about this, so maybe it's just the struggle we're in. I know some friends cry themselves to sleep at night because of the cost. We've learned to be frugal over the years. You start to appreciate the unique smell of flea market toys and used clothes. The adult world is full of that dusty smell. Some people might take up smoking, or they might just get used to the way things are. But the flea market is always there. It's a place where you can spend an afternoon and hear nothing but silence. There are three thrift stores within walking distance, and you can also find a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop if you walk a little farther. Downtown is bustling with people and cars every morning, but it's surprisingly quiet in the thrift stores. It reminders me of New York. Everyone's on their own agenda, and no one asks much of you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and no one will bother you. It's not like the South, where just being polite means you care. You don't pry into other people's lives here. You can keep to yourself as much as you like, and the city will continue on just fine. It's a lively place to be. The pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs make sure of that. We have a sense of community here, helping each other out when we need it. I've made some great neighbors, and they're kind enough to leave me food and help with my mail. I even like most of them. It's not just a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl; it's the people that make it feel like a home.",
            "The region where I live can be considered your run-of-the-mill cookie-cutter suburb. The presence of a homeowner's association is very noticeable. As you enter, you'll encounter nothing but well-groomed single-family homes, which the HOA can take credit for. Front yards are standardized with small patches of grass, pebbles, and short driveways, and occasional small trees. Every home boasts a two-car garage. As you drive through the neighborhood, you'll notice newly paved roads that are well-maintained and free of any potholes. Although there are varying home types, most are single-story, with the occasional two-story house. We don't have the typical mailbox setup for single-family homes. Instead, there's a centralized mailbox system at the end of the street, with everyone using keys to access their specific mailbox. There are two larger lockers for packages, and again, this is thanks to the HOA's obsession with uniformity. My house is located on the outskirts of the nearby city, making our neighborhood a blend of rural and suburban. This gives us ample space for everything from community pools to walking trails. The area is primarily retired folks, but there are also a few middle-aged and young professionals. The city, while large in population, has a small-town feel. It offers most of the amenities you'd expect, including a single mall, which is not huge but gets the job done. It takes around 15 minutes to drive to any significant place, where you'll find a variety of stores, from high-end grocery stores offering organic food to bargain outlets with minimal staff to keep costs down. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical, with plenty of nice things like pools and walking trails. You might have to drive a bit to get to significant stores, but it's not a problem when you can access all major chains by car.",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that's just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, located on the east side, is the most economically disadvantaged part of the town. Property values are low, with most houses either rented to or owned by low-income individuals. Despite this, it's not an unpleasant place. Neighbors are generally friendly, often smiling and saying hello as I walk down the street. Crime rates are a bit higher than other parts of town, but they're still generally low. In the past decade, there have been a few violent crimes within a few blocks of my home, including shootings and at least one homicide. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a nearby bar last year. Our family hasn't been directly affected by crime, except for occasional items disappearing from our porch if we forget to bring them in. The town has been significantly impacted by the \"opioid epidemic,\" with many lives lost to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are resources to combat this, such as addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected. Despite these challenges, the town has many positive aspects. My son's elementary school is excellent, with a positive atmosphere that makes it a great place for him, even with special needs. The PTO plans various events to promote family involvement and education. Over 20% of the town's population lives below the poverty line, so the school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students. No child or family is treated poorly due to their financial situation, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are reasonable. The City Council has made improvements to the town's appearance, like repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing parks, but most of these improvements are on the west side and center of town, where most shopping areas are located. This has left the east side, where I live, neglected, which is a point of contention among my neighbors. Overall, I enjoy living here. People are friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options, and our home, while not valuable, is comfortable and satisfying. We've lived here for over 16 years and can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is rich with culture, nestled on a hill surrounded by historic buildings. I reside in a 7-story apartment across from an old live theater, while just a block down, a unique arcade bar draws diverse crowds on warm summer evenings, often creating long lines, especially during June and July. A few blocks away lies a sizable city park, encircled by concrete and tall stairs, which provide shelter for homeless individuals during the cold winter months. The rain, despite the lack of snow, can be harsh, making it challenging to stay warm. They've learned to huddle together around the city center, close to a family center where they can bathe and shower, all within walking distance.\n\nWhat I cherish about my neighborhood isn't the architectural beauty but the people's spirit. Hilltop was once notorious for gang violence, and echoes of those times still linger. The people here work hard to keep their streets clean, despite the neighborhood's rough reputation. They've passed down stories from generation to generation, even to newcomers like me, about the federal officials and the DEA sweeping through the streets.\n\nThe sense of community is palpable. Despite the warnings to avoid the Hill at night due to its racial undertones, I feel a deep connection. It's amazing how I've found people who are quick to offer help rather than harm. They've shown me kindness in unexpected moments, from accepting the help of a laundromat owner to having a stranger offer me $5 on a dreary night.\n\nThis place is more than just a home; it's a testament to people's resilience and the power of community. It's a place where I feel truly alive.",
            "I hail from the heart of Rural America, nestled in the peaceful small town of Michigan. Our town is a charming blend of farmland and quaint tourist cities, but you won't find any big city malls or chain stores like Wal-mart, Target, or Applebee’s. Everything requires a bit of a drive, but the effort is worth it for the breathtaking landscapes. We are surrounded by water, with Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix as our neighbors, offering plenty of beaches for a quick dip. Our neighborhood embodies the essence of small-town living. Houses are not crammed together but spread out, each with its own unique charm. Most homes have full basements visible from the road, and while some are modernized, others carry the charm of older architecture. Aluminum siding adorns many structures, with yards featuring trampolines, play sets, gardens, and fences for pets. Our neighbors are hardworking folks, either raising families or having raised them, and the community is close-knit. You'll see kids playing, dog walkers, and cyclists or rollerbladers. Neighbors greet one another, and lawns are well-maintained, free from fall leaves and with green grass kept under control. This isn't a neighborhood you drive into and are impressed by the homes' beauty, but one where you feel safe and comfortable. The local sheriff's department and jail are within walking distance, as is the health department, recycling center, and baseball and softball fields. The small-town airport is nearby, offering the sound of small planes taking off and landing. You can walk to the local ice cream shop, and even ride your bike to the park a few blocks away. It's peaceful, safe, and exceptional for its representation of a place where you can call home."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem?

            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

My house has a small front yard and a driveway to the left. It, along with many others, brings back a sense of the suburban American dream that was once vibrant but now seems to be fading. The dream still holds, but the optimism that once fueled it is waning. Keeping up with the yards is a chore, and the once-bustling driveways have fewer cars. Kids still play football, oblivious to the world around them, while the public school, standing tall after nearly a century, inspires dreams in the youth and stirs nostalgic memories in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, often empty, but the basketball courts remain full. Each house looks unique but feels the same, echoing a shared history.

To some, it's a call to remember the Portland of the 90s and early 2000s, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, fostering unique and creative subcultures. To others, it's a welcoming sign, encouraging you to come to Portland where being weird is actually a compliment. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the constant construction of condos for them, Portland remains weird. Weird doesn't mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that aren't typically accepted. Weird doesn't mean we don't have modern amenities or modern problems. We buy most of our stuff from China, just like everywhere else. There's a million ways to be weird, to not be normal, but Portland is full of normal too. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird just means we take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, like many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers, herbs, and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime.

It's full of people who pursue their dreams, or at least dream about pursuing their dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems are often rooted in mental health issues, and the constant rain and gloomy skies don't help. Portland also has a homelessness problem, which is a challenge. The homeless population is drawn by Portland's social services, which are better than most, but our services are insufficient, just like everywhere else. The non-homeless population oscillates between care and hatred. In this, Portland is not weird at all.",
            "The mountains are always present, steadfast and unyielding, standing sentinel in the north. They greet the sun's journey every morning and evening, unperturbed by the ebb and flow of life. When life's pressures overwhelm me, the mountains remind me to seek solace in their grandeur. I first encountered them when I started my undergrad; they've been a constant companion since. While the university boasts its own stunning landscapes, the mountains hold a special place in my heart. The town itself is a blend of bustling urban energy and serene suburban charm. Its cafés have been the backdrop to countless study sessions fueled by caffeine. A short bus ride or walk takes you to the downtown area, where vintage brick buildings and lively eateries create an atmosphere of vibrancy. This urban energy fades into quiet residential neighborhoods near the library, offering a stark contrast and an invitation to explore. The town is a treasure trove of cherished memories, from late-night chats with friends by the park to movie nights at the university's fancy theater. Yet, it's also remembered for more somber moments, such as late-night reflections by the pond. While watching the pond's inhabitants go about their lives, I've often pondered my own purpose. The mountains, ever-present, have been there to remind me of my resilience. As I walked to a main street, the sun painted the sky with brilliant hues, and I realized I was heading north, towards the mountains. There they were, towering and steadfast, their peaks reaching for the sky. They stirred within me a sense of perseverance, a reminder to keep moving forward, one day at a time.",
            "If you plan on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you won't have any trouble locating it! Public transportation is incredibly accessible and is one of the most popular ways to get around in New York City. Bensonhurt is an urban neighborhood, so you'll still feel like you're in the heart of the city. Expect to see numerous Asian stores during your visit. Over the past couple of decades, Bensonhurt has seen a surge in Asian residents, resulting in an Asian-owned store on nearly every block. Supermarkets and laundromats are particularly common, and they're quite popular among local residents due to their high-quality food, reasonable prices, and convenience. Just around where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes' walk of each other, which makes grocery shopping a breeze! I'm not saying Bensonhurt is exclusively Asian, though; it's quite diverse, with immigrants and their first- and second-generation American children living there. Many of the neighborhood's large and popular businesses are Asian-owned. Additionally, there's a recently renovated park nearby with about ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we're in New York City, the parks are diverse. You'll see people of all backgrounds getting along well. In this neighborhood, there aren't many corporate buildings; instead, you'll find co-op living units or condominium apartments. Most residents live in two-family houses. While most people are friendly, it can be quite noisy. Every day, you'll hear cars blasting music as they drive by, and people often rev their engines loudly, which can wake you up in the morning. If you're visiting at night, be cautious. Bensonhurt is generally safe, but individuals can be unpredictable, and you might encounter people looking for trouble, bullies, or thieves. I've personally experienced physical assault in this neighborhood in the past, but that was many years ago. Recently, there have been incidents of package theft, which is relatively common in this neighborhood. Lastly, while New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, many residents don't follow the rules. Every morning, you'll see dog waste on your way to the train station or supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is finding dog waste everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!",
            "I live in a neighborhood that doesn't have many sidewalks. The terrain is hilly, and my house sits at the peak of the steepest hill in the area. Locals call it the \"workout hill\" because it's a popular spot for joggers. Since there are no sidewalks on my street, everyone walks on the road. The road is a bit rough due to potholes and can be hazardous to drive on. Some of the power lines and telephone wires are quite worn out and look a bit grimy. Our region gets a lot of rain and storms, which often lead to branches and debris falling and damaging the lines. The lines are constantly being repaired, giving them a patchwork appearance. There are numerous tall evergreen trees all around, which people often cut down because they block the view of the ocean. Many of the houses are built high up on the hill with large glass fronted second stories to enjoy the bay view. The sunset is breathtaking when the water seems to glow from below and the sky turns orange. Despite the stunning sunsets, it's often cloudy and damp around here. Moss grows on almost everything it can, including roofs, cars, and railings. I left my car parked in the driveway for a month once, and when I returned, it was covered in moss. It took me three hours to clean it off. There aren't many children around, but there's a school nearby. The neighborhood is mostly made up of older residents, many of whom are retired. Instead of kids, there are a lot of dogs. They often sit in people's lawns or race down the street. If you leave a door or window open, you might find one in your living room like I did. Rabbits are common in the area and can be quite large. They're a nuisance for gardeners because they dig up plant roots and burrow into lawns. My cats love to hunt them, and they've managed to get rid of many of them. We also have a variety of birds, from small sparrows and hummingbirds to the occasional hawk or eagle that gets chased off by the neighborhood crows. There aren't any stores nearby, but if you walk downhill to the waterfront, you can find a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach, but the rocks along the shore are fun to toss into the water. The bay isn't very wide, and you can see the opposite shore clearly through the mist most days.",
            "I live in a classic suburban neighborhood in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so our street sees a bit more traffic than I'd prefer, but other than that, it's a peaceful area. Not many people move in and out, so I'm familiar with most of my neighbors. They keep busy with yard work and other daily tasks. In winter, we enjoy sledding down a hill in our street. Since we live at the front corner of our block, we see neighbors coming and going all day, and we're familiar with the cars in the area. We're cautious about new vehicles. Some neighbors go for walks or walk their dogs, and kids play on their bikes. We're mostly at home as we work from our house. Our family consists of myself, my wife, and our two daughters, ages eleven and fourteen. With us constantly coming and going, everyone is used to our presence. We enjoy playing outside, even in the rain. We sometimes grill on our back deck, which always fills the air with a delicious barbecue scent. Lawn mowers run frequently from March until October. We have many trees, originally a wooded area, providing ample shade and a fall leaf cleanup. The smell of burning leaves indicates the arrival of fall. Lately, winter has been mild, extending our fall season. Our garage is at the back of the house, and we rarely use the front door unless someone knocks, which is uncommon. I enjoy working in the garage on my truck or other projects. With the garage doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays are generally quiet, with Thanksgiving and other holidays seeing some families visiting from out of town, adding extra cars to the area. Overall, I appreciate living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be ideal.",
            "My neighborhood is slap bang in the middle of the high desert, where dirt is king and everything is dusty brown. If you haven't experienced it, you can't grasp the sensation of seeing nothing but dirt, and when we do see a lawn, it's clear that the owner is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first moved here in the 90s, the houses were far and wide, but now it's still the same, with plenty of new additions. It feels like the city is growing bigger every day, but I guess that's the way of the world. The people here are generally friendly, and I'm lucky to have some great neighbors, mostly older folks. The stores around here are mostly chains like Food 4 Less, Smart & Final, and the like. If you're looking for something more upmarket, you'll have to travel a bit. The most common jobs here seem to be in construction, probably because the city is still growing and there's plenty of space to build. That's a bit scary for me, as I came from a big city and I'm not looking to move back. I'm a drywall and T-bar installer myself, so I know the job market firsthand. Our home is a wildlife paradise. We have three kids who love chasing lizards and desert bugs. We've adapted to the wildlife here pretty well. As for attractions, Victorville has its charms. The annual San Bernardino County Fair is definitely worth a visit, and you can't miss the snow-covered mountains in Wrightwood for some winter sports. If you're interested in the natural history and culture, the Victor Valley Museum is a must-see. It houses geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of Victorville's development.",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'd say it's a bit unique. Unlike others who might describe their neighborhood as a residential area with homeowners, mine is more akin to a college campus. The people living in my dormitory, along with the surrounding campus, make up my community and neighborhood. Even though it's not typical, my neighborhood has many similar features to a conventional one. We have houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's start with the houses. My neighborhood has three types: apartments, houses, and dormitories. In apartments, there are usually 2-4 people per room, with 4-6 rooms per floor. On average, each building houses about 20 people. Actual houses are rented by those affiliated with the school, usually alumni, and there are a handful scattered around. Dormitories are the most common housing type, with two people per room and hundreds of students living there. Moving on to the people, my school boasts diversity, and that's reflected in my neighborhood. There are staff members living in houses, new students in dorms, and older students in apartments. We have a mix of cultures and ages here. Lastly, there are plenty of stores and a single park. Stores offer usual dining options and our school's unique merchandise. Anything needed can be found within my neighborhood. Our park is a playground for diverse people, kept clean and safe by the community.",
            "Well, given that I've been living here for about a decade, I reckon I can share some insights. Initially, I was awfully bummed when we moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge. It was a rough transition, and I shed a few tears missing my beloved old neighborhood and friends. But my parents wanted the best for me and my sister, so we made the move to a supposedly \"better\" area with better housing and a more reputable high school. Over time, I adjusted and made new acquaintances, some of whom became friends, and others who turned out to be less so. I never really got to know my neighbors extensively, except for Mr. Glen and his family who live right next door, and Dennis, who’s just a stone's throw away. They've been amazing people to me, almost like extended family, and I truly appreciate their kindness. Remembering Mr. Glen’s wedding, where his new wife, Ms. Veda, tossed the wedding bouquet, and I managed to catch the garter but missed the flowers? It was an unforgettable night, and dancing with Marsharii, one of his daughters, was the cherry on top. I haven’t seen Marsharii since, but I hope she's doing well. Our neighborhood is a bit like a labyrinth, but with a GPS now, I've been exploring more. I've hung out with Kason and Curtis in some parts, and we had tons of fun playing video games and enjoying life. Sometimes, I visit the park to find solace in nature, which really calms my soul. I bring along sticks from Home Depot to practice my balance and my bokken wooden sword if I can. I also enjoy using the basketball and tennis courts, although it’s been a while since I’ve played either sport. My dad taught me and my best friend tennis with Mr. Graves back in the day, and we always had a blast. There’s plenty of fun memories here, and I'm excited about what's to come!",
            "My neighborhood is conveniently close to the college that I attend, which makes living here quite pleasant. The area is predominantly apartment buildings, but there are some restaurants and bars that provide a fun atmosphere without breaking the bank. Recently, one of the bars was renamed, and while it's now a bit pricier, the quality of service and drinks remains good. Most of the people I encounter are either college students or lower-income individuals, as the apartment housing is reasonably priced. An elementary school is nearby, and while I don't know my neighbors, they're generally nice. However, they smoke a lot of weed, so the building management installed an air freshener unit near their door, which my boyfriend and I found amusing. The buildings surrounding me are quite old but may have well-renovated interiors. Down the street, there are new apartments, but I'm not fond of them due to poor construction and high rents. There's a restaurant a few minutes away that serves most food on paper plates and uses a microwave, along with a gas station that's not great for employees. Fortunately, the road has been improved with city funding, adding a nice sidewalk and green spaces. My apartment building is surrounded by trees, and while a few were cut down, there are more than those down the road. Behind my complex is a tree line and another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but the buildings on 43rd street are less appealing due to poor sidewalks and rundown buildings. While the trees hide some of the dilapidated structures, there are criminal incidents at the apartment complex on that street. However, I appreciate my neighborhood because it's affordable and offers plenty of useful amenities, such as the university within walking distance and two bus stops for easy access to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood is filled with duplexes on a cul-de-sac, spaced out like individual homes. Each unit is painted yellow, with white porches and green metal roofs, giving it a distinct look. Most residents are friendly, often gathering at the end of the drive, chatting while kids play with toys, chalk, or fly kites. It's a refreshing change from the modern, tech-filled world. We're bordered by fields and trees, with blue skies and billowing clouds. The only downside? This season, we've been under tornado warnings. Last night, we heard the sirens and had to rush to shelter. I found myself in my bathtub, clutching my little dog, purse, and pillows. My bigger dog stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The storm brought hail, and the road literally steamed after the temperature drop. It was like a scene from a movie—from 92°F to 75°F in minutes. The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement. After the storm, the sun came out, revealing a double rainbow. I quickly grabbed my camera and snapped pictures to share. The neighborhood was quiet until some people returned home. Soon, it was back to normal, with moms and children outside, dinner cooking. It's a friendly community, a huge change from my life back in New Hampshire. I live in a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, like everyone else, but not all apartments are the same inside. Some are quite small. I love walking down the big field behind my house and listening to the giant bullfrog in the morning. It's a small-town vibe with roosters crowing and a nearby farm with a donkey. It's a gem of a neighborhood to be found just outside Charlotte.",
            "When I moved to this neighborhood right before eighth grade, it was a bit of a struggle to make friends at first, but eventually I connected with someone living two houses down and another guy on my street. Neither of them live here anymore, but the memories of those friendships remain. The same folks who lived here when I first arrived are still around. My neighborhood is pretty standard for an American suburban area, filled with two-story houses. On warm weekends, you can hear kids playing outside. Most days, it's quiet. I've never had any issues with my neighbors. They're all quite self-sufficient and helpful when needed. I've ordered numerous packages online without any problems, so I feel secure leaving them on my porch. I trust my neighbors implicitly.\n\nThere's a park just a couple of minutes walk from my house, where I've played basketball, football, and baseball with the neighborhood kids. Some of those games ended with bruises, like the time I got elbowed in the nose while playing football, but the good times outweigh the bad. Now, I visit the park to hang out with my cousin's kids, who love the swings and slides. Seeing them enjoy the park brings back a lot of nostalgia for me.\n\nOur neighborhood is quite diverse, with various cuisines nearby. Within a mile radius, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. Nowadays, many people use food delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get their meals, and fast food joints are easy to find in any suburban area. There are also plenty of pizza places around. The stores here carry everything you need, including multiple dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store. There's even an Indian-owned store if you're feeling adventurous with your cooking or just want some ready-made Indian food.\n\nOverall, I'm quite fond of my neighborhood. Reading about the issues others face with their neighbors on social media and the news makes me grateful for mine.",
            "My neighborhood is a charming little town in South Carolina. It's not too different from others, but it has a notable influence on the agricultural industry. Johnston is famously known as the Peach Capital of the World, a title proudly displayed on the welcoming sign. The town is primarily farmland, with peach orchards and cattle pastures taking center stage. Houses, which are usually two-story with either metal or gray shingle roofs, are spaced out, with many located further back to allow for front fields to be used for farming. In the town center, there's a single stop sign at a four-way intersection where you'll find the only stores. There are three places to grab a meal on the go: Hong Kong, a family-owned Chinese restaurant; Fiesta Mexican Restaurant; and Gary's, a small burger place. A pizzeria used to be there, but it closed down recently. There's also a small family pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug, renowned for their Cherry Coca-Cola. The only grocery store is Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, but many residents prefer to shop at a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for most of their groceries. The most popular store is Dollar General, which is always bustling. Across from the furniture store is a pet grooming business called Clark's Cuts and Kennels, offering services like daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and bathing. Both a doctor's office and a vet clinic are located away from town, though they are well-equipped to serve the town's residents. Johnston Elementary School is the only school in the town, with students attending middle and high school in a nearby town after fifth grade. There are no parks, but the town is working on creating a 2.5-acre recreational area to enhance family activities and attract more visitors. Despite the lack of entertainment options like movie theaters, bowling alleys, or hangout spots, Johnston is a pleasant town, small enough to be passed through quickly!",
            "The first time I heard of this place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a bit unexpected. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. None of my friends had heard about it either. Maybe it's the daily grind. A few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night because of the high cost of living. We've all learned to be thrifty over the years. You start to appreciate the smell of vintage toys and secondhand clothes. You don't notice it as much in adulthood. Some of us take up smoking, or we just get used to it. But the flea market is always present. The scent of adulthood lingers in old magazines piled on a closed piano. It sticks to the leather and won't go away, even after you clean. Here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start from the far end, you can visit two charity thrift shops, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling, with cars and people filling the streets every morning, but it's quiet inside the thrift stores. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store remains silent. It's a tranquil place to spend an afternoon. Each year, the city seems to grow busier. Cars and people flood it constantly. It's a developing city, they say. With one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still growing, showing signs of its struggles. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is focused on their own goals, and no one asks much of you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a bit concerned seems like you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here. You can maintain your distance as long as you want, and the city will keep moving like the waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something happening. In a way, I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl, but it's people like my neighbors who make me feel like I haven't completely ruined my life.",
            "The place I call home is your typical cookie cutter suburbia. The most noticeable thing about my neighborhood is the strict presence of a homeowner's association (HOA). The moment you step in, you're greeted by well-maintained single-family homes—all thanks to the HOA's meticulous upkeep. The front yards are all similar, with a small patch of grass, decorative pebbles, and short driveways. Occasionally, you'll spot a small tree. Every house has a two-car garage. As you drive through, you'll notice newly paved concrete roads in pristine condition, with no potholes in sight. Most houses are single-story, though you'll sometimes see two-story ones. Instead of individual mailboxes in front of each house, we have a communal setup at the end of the street, with large groupings of mailboxes and two larger lockers for packages. This uniformity is another attribute of the HOA's influence. My neighborhood is on the outskirts of the nearby city, making it a blend of rural and suburban living. This means we have plenty of land for various activities. We have multiple community pools, walking trails for dog walks or evening strolls, and no need to visit a park for exercise. Most residents are retired, with a small mix of middle-aged and young professionals. The city itself is surprisingly large in population but retains a small-town feel. We have most of the amenities you'd expect—like a single mall that's not huge but gets the job done. It takes about 15 minutes to drive to significant areas, where you'll find a variety of stores, from high-end grocery stores with organic options to bargain outlets with minimal staff. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have great facilities like pools and walking trails, and while we're not next door to major shopping, a quick car ride gets you there.",
            "I reside in a small Midwestern town, just on the outskirts of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, located on the east side, is the town's most economically disadvantaged area. Most houses here are rented out to or owned by low-income individuals. Despite this, it's not an unpleasant place to live. My neighbors are generally friendly folks who greet you with a smile as you walk down the street. While crime rates are slightly higher than other parts of town, they're still manageable. We've seen a few violent incidents here over the past decade, including a shooting and a homicide within a few blocks of my home. Fortunately, our family hasn't been directly impacted by crime. Our close neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. The opioid epidemic has hit this town hard, with many lives lost due to fentanyl overdoses. However, there are resources available to combat this issue, like addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends. Despite these challenges, the town has many positive aspects. My son's elementary school has excellent staff, and he's thriving despite having special needs. The school's positive atmosphere has prevented any bullying. The PTO organizes multiple events to promote family involvement and educational progress. Since over 20% of the town's population lives below the poverty line, the school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students. No child or family is treated as \"less than\" due to financial constraints. School fees, supplies, and field trip costs are affordable. The City Council has made many improvements to the town's appearance, like repaving roads and refurbishing city parks, but most of these improvements have been focused on the center and the west side, where shopping areas are located. The east side, where I live, tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for us. Nevertheless, I enjoy living here. People are friendly, the schools are great, and there are sufficient shopping options. Our home might not be worth much, but it's comfortable and adequate. Our family has been living here for over 16 years, and we can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is a cultural treasure trove, nestled on a hill, encircled by structures steeped in history. I call home a 7-story apartment building, just across the old live theatre, and a block down, there's a charming arcade bar that attracts all sorts of folks on warm summer evenings. On weekends in June and July, you might witness a line of people eager to enter. A few blocks up, lies the nearest city park, quite spacious for its location. Concrete steps surround the park, and during the harsh winter months, homeless individuals set up their tents in neat rows, close together to keep warm. Though it doesn't snow much, torrential rains in mid-winter make it challenging to stay cozy. They're near enough to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I adore about my city isn't the historical architecture, though it's impressive, but the people. Hilltop, once infamous for gang violence, still echoes with tales of the federal government's and DEA's efforts to clean its streets. Despite being one of the rougher 'hoods' in the city, the people here work hard to keep it tidy and still care deeply about their community. However, there's a lingering air of caution, especially for those who are white, to avoid the Hill after dark. I believe this warning is a remnant of the past, flavored with social conditioning. Perhaps my dark enough appearance allows me to blend in or maybe Hilltop perceives me as one of their own, someone acutely aware of the racial, cultural, and fearful assumptions that cloud our society. Regardless of where I roam, Hilltop will always be home. I feel alive walking its streets at night, receiving kindness from strangers more readily than threats. It's a place where laundry owners extend their hours to help out, and even on the greyest nights, someone might stop to offer a $5, complimenting my beauty and value.",
            "I call my home rural America, nestled in small-town Michigan. We transition from expansive farmlands to picturesque tourist cities, where big city conveniences like Walmart, Target, or Applebee’s are hard to find. Everywhere I need to go requires a drive, but I'm lucky to live in one of the most stunning places on Earth, surrounded by water. Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix flank my city, offering beaches for toe-dipping at every turn. My neighborhood encapsulates the essence of small-town living. Houses aren’t cookie-cutter or stacked, but rather older homes, some updated, some with aluminum siding. Most have full basements visible from the road, with yards featuring trampolines, playsets, gardens, and fences for pets. The houses reflect the hardworking people who call this place home, either raising families or having done so. Kids often play outside, and neighbors walk dogs, bike, or rollerblade. Neighbors recognize each other, and the lawns are well-maintained. It's not a neighborhood for show, but a serene, safe haven, perfect for family life. Essential services like the county sheriff’s department, health department, recycling center, baseball fields, and a small-town airport are nearby. You can hear small planes taking off and landing, and kids riding bikes to the park just eight blocks away. It's a great place to call home."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "Living in a large city, my neighborhood is incredibly diverse. Residential areas are scattered among commercial zones, where a variety of businesses operate. Some are massive corporations, others are quaint stores and restaurants, and there are even places for entertainment. The options for food and shopping are endless, with both big-name brands and small boutiques lining the streets and nearby malls. Within walking distance of these lively areas are parks, which are often filled with young families. The people in my neighborhood are incredibly diverse too, ranging from a strong LGBTQ+ and Orthodox Jewish presence to a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Just a short distance away, I find communities of various ethnicities like Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia. However, distances can be deceiving here, with even a 10-mile drive sometimes taking up to two hours due to heavy traffic. Most people in the city commute by car, and parking can be quite a challenge. Ironically, there has been a lot of construction recently, with new apartment buildings popping up everywhere. While it's a popular destination, many residents are wary of the increased population and traffic. Housing options are varied, from single-family homes and duplexes to smaller apartment buildings and condos. And while my neighborhood is diverse, I'm not very familiar with my neighbors, except for a few friends I grew up with. It's not the tight-knit community it once was, but I have fond memories of playing with my neighbors from my childhood.",
            "My neighborhood is a throwback to simpler times. Most homes are single-family dwellings, but a few have been split into two, still sharing a wall. My house has a small front yard and a driveway to the left. It, along with many others, brings back a sense of the suburban American dream that was once vibrant but now seems to be fading. The dream still holds, but the optimism that once fueled it is waning. Keeping up with the yards is a chore, and the once-bustling driveways have fewer cars. Kids still play football, oblivious to the world around them, while the public school, standing tall after nearly a century, inspires dreams in the youth and stirs nostalgic memories in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, often empty, but the basketball courts remain full. Each house looks unique but feels the same, echoing a shared history. A large supermarket, Super \"A,\" has been owned by a Yemeni family, likely the only Arab in the neighborhood. Most residents are African American, with many having been here for generations. They can share stories of a time when everyone knew everyone. There was once a karate school, but it closed when Hollywood stopped making karate movies, replaced by a pharmacy. A discounted movie theater plays old films, favored by the elders who see it as a cheap night out, sans kids. A single expressway runs through our town, but its exit and entrance are in the neighboring town. There was a petition for an exit in our town, supported by the youth and rejected by the elders, who feared it would spoil our town. A new high school is being built, and we're exploring mascots. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin could be a fitting representation of our town.",
            "You might not notice it at first glance - after all, it's a residential area tucked behind a commercial strip. Most people would assume there's no reason to live there, but if you venture behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk past the hotels, which are only occupied annually, you'll find a thriving community. There, you'll see several apartment complexes lined up like Russian nesting dolls that have been carefully taken apart and placed side by side. The first apartments may not look too appealing, but the ones beside and beyond them are another story, a secret world that most locals know nothing about. Across the street is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings where students shuffle in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 a.m. to start their day. The iron gates groan open to let them in, while commuters honk their horns at the traffic delays. The road intersects with another residential street, leading to a park and a rehabilitation center for those who've had unfortunate accidents. The center's cheerful porch furniture and ceiling fan provide relief from the thick summer air. Kids cartwheel and play in the park across the street, while bees lazily buzz around flower patches. Retired folks walk their dogs along the path, grumbling at teenage skaters and nodding politely to the girls hanging out by the playground equipment. A strip mall beside the park boasts an inexpensive sushi restaurant, a swimming supply store, and a nail salon. You could fill your pool, get a manicure, and enjoy hibachi chicken all in one trip. There's also a DIY frozen yogurt shop where teens can be seen on their skateboards, enjoying cold, sweet treats. This neighborhood is a slice of Americana - a timeless piece of history in the quiet south where change is rare, even time itself seems to slow down.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove past the corn fields that stretched as far as the eye could see. \"This is it!\" I exclaimed, knowing she'd be amazed by the vast open spaces. She was from a town where the grocery store was just a five-minute walk from her house—she'd never seen this much open space before. Taken aback by the endless corn fields, I shared what it was like growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she understood who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you'll come across a quarry filled with water. Just past that, you'll reach the small development where I live. The houses here are mostly made of brick and stucco, each with at least half an acre of land that everyone takes great pride in maintaining. During spring, the yards are filled with flowers and midwestern trees that change with the seasons. The driveways are filled with high-end Mercedes-Benz luxury cars that gleam in the midday sun after a good car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside, with a warm smile. He spends his days mowing his lawn, singing over the hum of his mower, and can be heard from far away. Everyone in the neighborhood finds him amusing, but he's always genuine and has a unique history. He used to be a doctor and now blends in with the grass and his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Finally, you'll reach my home. In the side yard, there are abundant geese that our Terrier chases. Out back is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the sound of the stream, and the occasional \"moo\" from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is a hidden oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was where I spent most of my childhood—building tree forts, 'hunting' animals, and making friends in the neighborhood. The winters in my small town can be extremely harsh, but there's no other place as beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green to an empty wilderness, with the trees becoming barren skeletons. When it snows, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is filled with snow angels made by my little sister and snowmen. My sister and I fought a lot as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our favorite weapon. We'd build massive igloo-like forts to house our arsenal, using branches. In our own little wonderland, we played pretend, lost in a world where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids, carefree and innocent.",
            "The first thing you need to understand about Portland, Oregon is that it's the literal definition of \"weird\". The town's unofficial motto, proudly displayed on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, and, let's just say, a certain type of establishment that skirts the law, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, it's a call to remember the Portland of the 90s and early 2000s, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, fostering unique and creative subcultures. To others, it's a welcoming sign, encouraging you to come to Portland where being weird is actually a compliment. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the constant construction of condos for them, Portland remains weird. Weird doesn't mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that aren't typically accepted. Weird doesn't mean we don't have modern amenities or modern problems. We buy most of our stuff from China, just like everywhere else. There's a million ways to be weird, to not be normal, but Portland is full of normal too. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird just means we take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, like many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers, herbs, and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are basically cardboard boxes filled with stuff someone's getting rid of, but they can also be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a perfect treasure for the person wandering by, surprisingly often. They usually have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about, at least in my opinion. There are countless varieties of weirdness in Portland. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. They'd rather go to goat yoga (yep, yoga with real goats) or Timbers matches (Portland's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. It's full of people who pursue their dreams, or at least dream about pursuing their dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems are often rooted in mental health issues, and the constant rain and gloomy skies don't help. Portland also has a homelessness problem, which is a challenge. The homeless population is drawn by Portland's social services, which are better than most, but our services are insufficient, just like everywhere else. The non-homeless population oscillates between care and hatred. In this, Portland is not weird at all.",
            "The mountains are always present, steadfast and unyielding, standing sentinel in the north. They greet the sun's journey every morning and evening, unperturbed by the ebb and flow of life. When life's pressures overwhelm me, the mountains remind me to seek solace in their grandeur. I first encountered them when I started my undergrad; they've been a constant companion since. While the university boasts its own stunning landscapes, the mountains hold a special place in my heart. The town itself is a blend of bustling urban energy and serene suburban charm. Its cafés have been the backdrop to countless study sessions fueled by caffeine. A short bus ride or walk takes you to the downtown area, where vintage brick buildings and lively eateries create an atmosphere of vibrancy. This urban energy fades into quiet residential neighborhoods near the library, offering a stark contrast and an invitation to explore. The town is a treasure trove of cherished memories, from late-night chats with friends by the park to movie nights at the university's fancy theater. Yet, it's also remembered for more somber moments, such as late-night reflections by the pond. While watching the pond's inhabitants go about their lives, I've often pondered my own purpose. The mountains, ever-present, have been there to remind me of my resilience. As I walked to a main street, the sun painted the sky with brilliant hues, and I realized I was heading north, towards the mountains. There they were, towering and steadfast, their peaks reaching for the sky. They stirred within me a sense of perseverance, a reminder to keep moving forward, one day at a time.",
            "If you plan on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you won't have any trouble locating it! Public transportation is incredibly accessible and is one of the most popular ways to get around in New York City. Bensonhurt is an urban neighborhood, so you'll still feel like you're in the heart of the city. Expect to see numerous Asian stores during your visit. Over the past couple of decades, Bensonhurt has seen a surge in Asian residents, resulting in an Asian-owned store on nearly every block. Supermarkets and laundromats are particularly common, and they're quite popular among local residents due to their high-quality food, reasonable prices, and convenience. Just around where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes' walk of each other, which makes grocery shopping a breeze! I'm not saying Bensonhurt is exclusively Asian, though; it's quite diverse, with immigrants and their first- and second-generation American children living there. Many of the neighborhood's large and popular businesses are Asian-owned. Additionally, there's a recently renovated park nearby with about ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we're in New York City, the parks are diverse. You'll see people of all backgrounds getting along well. In this neighborhood, there aren't many corporate buildings; instead, you'll find co-op living units or condominium apartments. Most residents live in two-family houses. While most people are friendly, it can be quite noisy. Every day, you'll hear cars blasting music as they drive by, and people often rev their engines loudly, which can wake you up in the morning. If you're visiting at night, be cautious. Bensonhurt is generally safe, but individuals can be unpredictable, and you might encounter people looking for trouble, bullies, or thieves. I've personally experienced physical assault in this neighborhood in the past, but that was many years ago. Recently, there have been incidents of package theft, which is relatively common in this neighborhood. Lastly, while New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, many residents don't follow the rules. Every morning, you'll see dog waste on your way to the train station or supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is finding dog waste everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!",
            "I live in a neighborhood that doesn't have many sidewalks. The terrain is hilly, and my house sits at the peak of the steepest hill in the area. Locals call it the \"workout hill\" because it's a popular spot for joggers. Since there are no sidewalks on my street, everyone walks on the road. The road is a bit rough due to potholes and can be hazardous to drive on. Some of the power lines and telephone wires are quite worn out and look a bit grimy. Our region gets a lot of rain and storms, which often lead to branches and debris falling and damaging the lines. The lines are constantly being repaired, giving them a patchwork appearance. There are numerous tall evergreen trees all around, which people often cut down because they block the view of the ocean. Many of the houses are built high up on the hill with large glass fronted second stories to enjoy the bay view. The sunset is breathtaking when the water seems to glow from below and the sky turns orange. Despite the stunning sunsets, it's often cloudy and damp around here. Moss grows on almost everything it can, including roofs, cars, and railings. I left my car parked in the driveway for a month once, and when I returned, it was covered in moss. It took me three hours to clean it off. There aren't many children around, but there's a school nearby. The neighborhood is mostly made up of older residents, many of whom are retired. Instead of kids, there are a lot of dogs. They often sit in people's lawns or race down the street. If you leave a door or window open, you might find one in your living room like I did. Rabbits are common in the area and can be quite large. They're a nuisance for gardeners because they dig up plant roots and burrow into lawns. My cats love to hunt them, and they've managed to get rid of many of them. We also have a variety of birds, from small sparrows and hummingbirds to the occasional hawk or eagle that gets chased off by the neighborhood crows. There aren't any stores nearby, but if you walk downhill to the waterfront, you can find a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach, but the rocks along the shore are fun to toss into the water. The bay isn't very wide, and you can see the opposite shore clearly through the mist most days.",
            "I live in a classic suburban neighborhood in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so our street sees a bit more traffic than I'd prefer, but other than that, it's a peaceful area. Not many people move in and out, so I'm familiar with most of my neighbors. They keep busy with yard work and other daily tasks. In winter, we enjoy sledding down a hill in our street. Since we live at the front corner of our block, we see neighbors coming and going all day, and we're familiar with the cars in the area. We're cautious about new vehicles. Some neighbors go for walks or walk their dogs, and kids play on their bikes. We're mostly at home as we work from our house. Our family consists of myself, my wife, and our two daughters, ages eleven and fourteen. With us constantly coming and going, everyone is used to our presence. We enjoy playing outside, even in the rain. We sometimes grill on our back deck, which always fills the air with a delicious barbecue scent. Lawn mowers run frequently from March until October. We have many trees, originally a wooded area, providing ample shade and a fall leaf cleanup. The smell of burning leaves indicates the arrival of fall. Lately, winter has been mild, extending our fall season. Our garage is at the back of the house, and we rarely use the front door unless someone knocks, which is uncommon. I enjoy working in the garage on my truck or other projects. With the garage doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays are generally quiet, with Thanksgiving and other holidays seeing some families visiting from out of town, adding extra cars to the area. Overall, I appreciate living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be ideal.",
            "My neighborhood is slap bang in the middle of the high desert, where dirt is king and everything is dusty brown. If you haven't experienced it, you can't grasp the sensation of seeing nothing but dirt, and when we do see a lawn, it's clear that the owner is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first moved here in the 90s, the houses were far and wide, but now it's still the same, with plenty of new additions. It feels like the city is growing bigger every day, but I guess that's the way of the world. The people here are generally friendly, and I'm lucky to have some great neighbors, mostly older folks. The stores around here are mostly chains like Food 4 Less, Smart & Final, and the like. If you're looking for something more upmarket, you'll have to travel a bit. The most common jobs here seem to be in construction, probably because the city is still growing and there's plenty of space to build. That's a bit scary for me, as I came from a big city and I'm not looking to move back. I'm a drywall and T-bar installer myself, so I know the job market firsthand. Our home is a wildlife paradise. We have three kids who love chasing lizards and desert bugs. We've adapted to the wildlife here pretty well. As for attractions, Victorville has its charms. The annual San Bernardino County Fair is definitely worth a visit, and you can't miss the snow-covered mountains in Wrightwood for some winter sports. If you're interested in the natural history and culture, the Victor Valley Museum is a must-see. It houses geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of Victorville's development.",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'd say it's a bit unique. Unlike others who might describe their neighborhood as a residential area with homeowners, mine is more akin to a college campus. The people living in my dormitory, along with the surrounding campus, make up my community and neighborhood. Even though it's not typical, my neighborhood has many similar features to a conventional one. We have houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's start with the houses. My neighborhood has three types: apartments, houses, and dormitories. In apartments, there are usually 2-4 people per room, with 4-6 rooms per floor. On average, each building houses about 20 people. Actual houses are rented by those affiliated with the school, usually alumni, and there are a handful scattered around. Dormitories are the most common housing type, with two people per room and hundreds of students living there. Moving on to the people, my school boasts diversity, and that's reflected in my neighborhood. There are staff members living in houses, new students in dorms, and older students in apartments. We have a mix of cultures and ages here. Lastly, there are plenty of stores and a single park. Stores offer usual dining options and our school's unique merchandise. Anything needed can be found within my neighborhood. Our park is a playground for diverse people, kept clean and safe by the community.",
            "Well, given that I've been living here for about a decade, I reckon I can share some insights. Initially, I was awfully bummed when we moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge. It was a rough transition, and I shed a few tears missing my beloved old neighborhood and friends. But my parents wanted the best for me and my sister, so we made the move to a supposedly \"better\" area with better housing and a more reputable high school. Over time, I adjusted and made new acquaintances, some of whom became friends, and others who turned out to be less so. I never really got to know my neighbors extensively, except for Mr. Glen and his family who live right next door, and Dennis, who’s just a stone's throw away. They've been amazing people to me, almost like extended family, and I truly appreciate their kindness. Remembering Mr. Glen’s wedding, where his new wife, Ms. Veda, tossed the wedding bouquet, and I managed to catch the garter but missed the flowers? It was an unforgettable night, and dancing with Marsharii, one of his daughters, was the cherry on top. I haven’t seen Marsharii since, but I hope she's doing well. Our neighborhood is a bit like a labyrinth, but with a GPS now, I've been exploring more. I've hung out with Kason and Curtis in some parts, and we had tons of fun playing video games and enjoying life. Sometimes, I visit the park to find solace in nature, which really calms my soul. I bring along sticks from Home Depot to practice my balance and my bokken wooden sword if I can. I also enjoy using the basketball and tennis courts, although it’s been a while since I’ve played either sport. My dad taught me and my best friend tennis with Mr. Graves back in the day, and we always had a blast. There’s plenty of fun memories here, and I'm excited about what's to come!",
            "My neighborhood is conveniently close to the college that I attend, which makes living here quite pleasant. The area is predominantly apartment buildings, but there are some restaurants and bars that provide a fun atmosphere without breaking the bank. Recently, one of the bars was renamed, and while it's now a bit pricier, the quality of service and drinks remains good. Most of the people I encounter are either college students or lower-income individuals, as the apartment housing is reasonably priced. An elementary school is nearby, and while I don't know my neighbors, they're generally nice. However, they smoke a lot of weed, so the building management installed an air freshener unit near their door, which my boyfriend and I found amusing. The buildings surrounding me are quite old but may have well-renovated interiors. Down the street, there are new apartments, but I'm not fond of them due to poor construction and high rents. There's a restaurant a few minutes away that serves most food on paper plates and uses a microwave, along with a gas station that's not great for employees. Fortunately, the road has been improved with city funding, adding a nice sidewalk and green spaces. My apartment building is surrounded by trees, and while a few were cut down, there are more than those down the road. Behind my complex is a tree line and another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but the buildings on 43rd street are less appealing due to poor sidewalks and rundown buildings. While the trees hide some of the dilapidated structures, there are criminal incidents at the apartment complex on that street. However, I appreciate my neighborhood because it's affordable and offers plenty of useful amenities, such as the university within walking distance and two bus stops for easy access to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood is filled with duplexes on a cul-de-sac, spaced out like individual homes. Each unit is painted yellow, with white porches and green metal roofs, giving it a distinct look. Most residents are friendly, often gathering at the end of the drive, chatting while kids play with toys, chalk, or fly kites. It's a refreshing change from the modern, tech-filled world. We're bordered by fields and trees, with blue skies and billowing clouds. The only downside? This season, we've been under tornado warnings. Last night, we heard the sirens and had to rush to shelter. I found myself in my bathtub, clutching my little dog, purse, and pillows. My bigger dog stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The storm brought hail, and the road literally steamed after the temperature drop. It was like a scene from a movie—from 92°F to 75°F in minutes. The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement. After the storm, the sun came out, revealing a double rainbow. I quickly grabbed my camera and snapped pictures to share. The neighborhood was quiet until some people returned home. Soon, it was back to normal, with moms and children outside, dinner cooking. It's a friendly community, a huge change from my life back in New Hampshire. I live in a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, like everyone else, but not all apartments are the same inside. Some are quite small. I love walking down the big field behind my house and listening to the giant bullfrog in the morning. It's a small-town vibe with roosters crowing and a nearby farm with a donkey. It's a gem of a neighborhood to be found just outside Charlotte.",
            "When I moved to this neighborhood right before eighth grade, it was a bit of a struggle to make friends at first, but eventually I connected with someone living two houses down and another guy on my street. Neither of them live here anymore, but the memories of those friendships remain. The same folks who lived here when I first arrived are still around. My neighborhood is pretty standard for an American suburban area, filled with two-story houses. On warm weekends, you can hear kids playing outside. Most days, it's quiet. I've never had any issues with my neighbors. They're all quite self-sufficient and helpful when needed. I've ordered numerous packages online without any problems, so I feel secure leaving them on my porch. I trust my neighbors implicitly.\n\nThere's a park just a couple of minutes walk from my house, where I've played basketball, football, and baseball with the neighborhood kids. Some of those games ended with bruises, like the time I got elbowed in the nose while playing football, but the good times outweigh the bad. Now, I visit the park to hang out with my cousin's kids, who love the swings and slides. Seeing them enjoy the park brings back a lot of nostalgia for me.\n\nOur neighborhood is quite diverse, with various cuisines nearby. Within a mile radius, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. Nowadays, many people use food delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get their meals, and fast food joints are easy to find in any suburban area. There are also plenty of pizza places around. The stores here carry everything you need, including multiple dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store. There's even an Indian-owned store if you're feeling adventurous with your cooking or just want some ready-made Indian food.\n\nOverall, I'm quite fond of my neighborhood. Reading about the issues others face with their neighbors on social media and the news makes me grateful for mine.",
            "My neighborhood is a charming little town in South Carolina. It's not too different from others, but it has a notable influence on the agricultural industry. Johnston is famously known as the Peach Capital of the World, a title proudly displayed on the welcoming sign. The town is primarily farmland, with peach orchards and cattle pastures taking center stage. Houses, which are usually two-story with either metal or gray shingle roofs, are spaced out, with many located further back to allow for front fields to be used for farming. In the town center, there's a single stop sign at a four-way intersection where you'll find the only stores. There are three places to grab a meal on the go: Hong Kong, a family-owned Chinese restaurant; Fiesta Mexican Restaurant; and Gary's, a small burger place. A pizzeria used to be there, but it closed down recently. There's also a small family pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug, renowned for their Cherry Coca-Cola. The only grocery store is Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, but many residents prefer to shop at a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for most of their groceries. The most popular store is Dollar General, which is always bustling. Across from the furniture store is a pet grooming business called Clark's Cuts and Kennels, offering services like daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and bathing. Both a doctor's office and a vet clinic are located away from town, though they are well-equipped to serve the town's residents. Johnston Elementary School is the only school in the town, with students attending middle and high school in a nearby town after fifth grade. There are no parks, but the town is working on creating a 2.5-acre recreational area to enhance family activities and attract more visitors. Despite the lack of entertainment options like movie theaters, bowling alleys, or hangout spots, Johnston is a pleasant town, small enough to be passed through quickly!",
            "The first time I heard of this place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a bit unexpected. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. None of my friends had heard about it either. Maybe it's the daily grind. A few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night because of the high cost of living. We've all learned to be thrifty over the years. You start to appreciate the smell of vintage toys and secondhand clothes. You don't notice it as much in adulthood. Some of us take up smoking, or we just get used to it. But the flea market is always present. The scent of adulthood lingers in old magazines piled on a closed piano. It sticks to the leather and won't go away, even after you clean. Here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start from the far end, you can visit two charity thrift shops, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling, with cars and people filling the streets every morning, but it's quiet inside the thrift stores. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store remains silent. It's a tranquil place to spend an afternoon. Each year, the city seems to grow busier. Cars and people flood it constantly. It's a developing city, they say. With one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still growing, showing signs of its struggles. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is focused on their own goals, and no one asks much of you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a bit concerned seems like you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here. You can maintain your distance as long as you want, and the city will keep moving like the waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something happening. In a way, I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl, but it's people like my neighbors who make me feel like I haven't completely ruined my life.",
            "The place I call home is your typical cookie cutter suburbia. The most noticeable thing about my neighborhood is the strict presence of a homeowner's association (HOA). The moment you step in, you're greeted by well-maintained single-family homes—all thanks to the HOA's meticulous upkeep. The front yards are all similar, with a small patch of grass, decorative pebbles, and short driveways. Occasionally, you'll spot a small tree. Every house has a two-car garage. As you drive through, you'll notice newly paved concrete roads in pristine condition, with no potholes in sight. Most houses are single-story, though you'll sometimes see two-story ones. Instead of individual mailboxes in front of each house, we have a communal setup at the end of the street, with large groupings of mailboxes and two larger lockers for packages. This uniformity is another attribute of the HOA's influence. My neighborhood is on the outskirts of the nearby city, making it a blend of rural and suburban living. This means we have plenty of land for various activities. We have multiple community pools, walking trails for dog walks or evening strolls, and no need to visit a park for exercise. Most residents are retired, with a small mix of middle-aged and young professionals. The city itself is surprisingly large in population but retains a small-town feel. We have most of the amenities you'd expect—like a single mall that's not huge but gets the job done. It takes about 15 minutes to drive to significant areas, where you'll find a variety of stores, from high-end grocery stores with organic options to bargain outlets with minimal staff. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have great facilities like pools and walking trails, and while we're not next door to major shopping, a quick car ride gets you there.",
            "I reside in a small Midwestern town, just on the outskirts of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, located on the east side, is the town's most economically disadvantaged area. Most houses here are rented out to or owned by low-income individuals. Despite this, it's not an unpleasant place to live. My neighbors are generally friendly folks who greet you with a smile as you walk down the street. While crime rates are slightly higher than other parts of town, they're still manageable. We've seen a few violent incidents here over the past decade, including a shooting and a homicide within a few blocks of my home. Fortunately, our family hasn't been directly impacted by crime. Our close neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. The opioid epidemic has hit this town hard, with many lives lost due to fentanyl overdoses. However, there are resources available to combat this issue, like addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends. Despite these challenges, the town has many positive aspects. My son's elementary school has excellent staff, and he's thriving despite having special needs. The school's positive atmosphere has prevented any bullying. The PTO organizes multiple events to promote family involvement and educational progress. Since over 20% of the town's population lives below the poverty line, the school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students. No child or family is treated as \"less than\" due to financial constraints. School fees, supplies, and field trip costs are affordable. The City Council has made many improvements to the town's appearance, like repaving roads and refurbishing city parks, but most of these improvements have been focused on the center and the west side, where shopping areas are located. The east side, where I live, tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for us. Nevertheless, I enjoy living here. People are friendly, the schools are great, and there are sufficient shopping options. Our home might not be worth much, but it's comfortable and adequate. Our family has been living here for over 16 years, and we can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is a cultural treasure trove, nestled on a hill, encircled by structures steeped in history. I call home a 7-story apartment building, just across the old live theatre, and a block down, there's a charming arcade bar that attracts all sorts of folks on warm summer evenings. On weekends in June and July, you might witness a line of people eager to enter. A few blocks up, lies the nearest city park, quite spacious for its location. Concrete steps surround the park, and during the harsh winter months, homeless individuals set up their tents in neat rows, close together to keep warm. Though it doesn't snow much, torrential rains in mid-winter make it challenging to stay cozy. They're near enough to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I adore about my city isn't the historical architecture, though it's impressive, but the people. Hilltop, once infamous for gang violence, still echoes with tales of the federal government's and DEA's efforts to clean its streets. Despite being one of the rougher 'hoods' in the city, the people here work hard to keep it tidy and still care deeply about their community. However, there's a lingering air of caution, especially for those who are white, to avoid the Hill after dark. I believe this warning is a remnant of the past, flavored with social conditioning. Perhaps my dark enough appearance allows me to blend in or maybe Hilltop perceives me as one of their own, someone acutely aware of the racial, cultural, and fearful assumptions that cloud our society. Regardless of where I roam, Hilltop will always be home. I feel alive walking its streets at night, receiving kindness from strangers more readily than threats. It's a place where laundry owners extend their hours to help out, and even on the greyest nights, someone might stop to offer a $5, complimenting my beauty and value.",
            "I call my home rural America, nestled in small-town Michigan. We transition from expansive farmlands to picturesque tourist cities, where big city conveniences like Walmart, Target, or Applebee’s are hard to find. Everywhere I need to go requires a drive, but I'm lucky to live in one of the most stunning places on Earth, surrounded by water. Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix flank my city, offering beaches for toe-dipping at every turn. My neighborhood encapsulates the essence of small-town living. Houses aren’t cookie-cutter or stacked, but rather older homes, some updated, some with aluminum siding. Most have full basements visible from the road, with yards featuring trampolines, playsets, gardens, and fences for pets. The houses reflect the hardworking people who call this place home, either raising families or having done so. Kids often play outside, and neighbors walk dogs, bike, or rollerblade. Neighbors recognize each other, and the lawns are well-maintained. It's not a neighborhood for show, but a serene, safe haven, perfect for family life. Essential services like the county sheriff’s department, health department, recycling center, baseball fields, and a small-town airport are nearby. You can hear small planes taking off and landing, and kids riding bikes to the park just eight blocks away. It's a great place to call home."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "Living in a large city, my neighborhood is incredibly diverse. Residential areas are scattered among commercial zones, where a variety of businesses operate. Some are massive corporations, others are quaint stores and restaurants, and there are even places for entertainment. The options for food and shopping are endless, with both big-name brands and small boutiques lining the streets and nearby malls. Within walking distance of these lively areas are parks, which are often filled with young families. The people in my neighborhood are incredibly diverse too, ranging from a strong LGBTQ+ and Orthodox Jewish presence to a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Just a short distance away, I find communities of various ethnicities like Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia. However, distances can be deceiving here, with even a 10-mile drive sometimes taking up to two hours due to heavy traffic. Most people in the city commute by car, and parking can be quite a challenge. Ironically, there has been a lot of construction recently, with new apartment buildings popping up everywhere. While it's a popular destination, many residents are wary of the increased population and traffic. Housing options are varied, from single-family homes and duplexes to smaller apartment buildings and condos. And while my neighborhood is diverse, I'm not very familiar with my neighbors, except for a few friends I grew up with. It's not the tight-knit community it once was, but I have fond memories of playing with my neighbors from my childhood.",
            "My neighborhood is a throwback to simpler times. Most homes are single-family dwellings, but a few have been split into two, still sharing a wall. My house has a small front yard and a driveway to the left. It, along with many others, brings back a sense of the suburban American dream that was once vibrant but now seems to be fading. The dream still holds, but the optimism that once fueled it is waning. Keeping up with the yards is a chore, and the once-bustling driveways have fewer cars. Kids still play football, oblivious to the world around them, while the public school, standing tall after nearly a century, inspires dreams in the youth and stirs nostalgic memories in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, often empty, but the basketball courts remain full. Each house looks unique but feels the same, echoing a shared history. A large supermarket, Super \"A,\" has been owned by a Yemeni family, likely the only Arab in the neighborhood. Most residents are African American, with many having been here for generations. They can share stories of a time when everyone knew everyone. There was once a karate school, but it closed when Hollywood stopped making karate movies, replaced by a pharmacy. A discounted movie theater plays old films, favored by the elders who see it as a cheap night out, sans kids. A single expressway runs through our town, but its exit and entrance are in the neighboring town. There was a petition for an exit in our town, supported by the youth and rejected by the elders, who feared it would spoil our town. A new high school is being built, and we're exploring mascots. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin could be a fitting representation of our town.",
            "You might not notice it at first glance - after all, it's a residential area tucked behind a commercial strip. Most people would assume there's no reason to live there, but if you venture behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk past the hotels, which are only occupied annually, you'll find a thriving community. There, you'll see several apartment complexes lined up like Russian nesting dolls that have been carefully taken apart and placed side by side. The first apartments may not look too appealing, but the ones beside and beyond them are another story, a secret world that most locals know nothing about. Across the street is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings where students shuffle in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 a.m. to start their day. The iron gates groan open to let them in, while commuters honk their horns at the traffic delays. The road intersects with another residential street, leading to a park and a rehabilitation center for those who've had unfortunate accidents. The center's cheerful porch furniture and ceiling fan provide relief from the thick summer air. Kids cartwheel and play in the park across the street, while bees lazily buzz around flower patches. Retired folks walk their dogs along the path, grumbling at teenage skaters and nodding politely to the girls hanging out by the playground equipment. A strip mall beside the park boasts an inexpensive sushi restaurant, a swimming supply store, and a nail salon. You could fill your pool, get a manicure, and enjoy hibachi chicken all in one trip. There's also a DIY frozen yogurt shop where teens can be seen on their skateboards, enjoying cold, sweet treats. This neighborhood is a slice of Americana - a timeless piece of history in the quiet south where change is rare, even time itself seems to slow down.",

            "The first thing you need to understand about Portland, Oregon is that it's the literal definition of \"weird\". The town's unofficial motto, proudly displayed on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, and, let's just say, a certain type of establishment that skirts the law, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, it's a call to remember the Portland of the 90s and early 2000s, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, fostering unique and creative subcultures. To others, it's a welcoming sign, encouraging you to come to Portland where being weird is actually a compliment. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the constant construction of condos for them, Portland remains weird. Weird doesn't mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that aren't typically accepted. Weird doesn't mean we don't have modern amenities or modern problems. We buy most of our stuff from China, just like everywhere else. There's a million ways to be weird, to not be normal, but Portland is full of normal too. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird just means we take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, like many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers, herbs, and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are basically cardboard boxes filled with stuff someone's getting rid of, but they can also be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a perfect treasure for the person wandering by, surprisingly often. They usually have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about, at least in my opinion. There are countless varieties of weirdness in Portland. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. They'd rather go to goat yoga (yep, yoga with real goats) or Timbers matches (Portland's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. It's full of people who pursue their dreams, or at least dream about pursuing their dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems are often rooted in mental health issues, and the constant rain and gloomy skies don't help. Portland also has a homelessness problem, which is a challenge. The homeless population is drawn by Portland's social services, which are better than most, but our services are insufficient, just like everywhere else. The non-homeless population oscillates between care and hatred. In this, Portland is not weird at all.",
            "The mountains are always present, steadfast and unyielding, standing sentinel in the north. They greet the sun's journey every morning and evening, unperturbed by the ebb and flow of life. When life's pressures overwhelm me, the mountains remind me to seek solace in their grandeur. I first encountered them when I started my undergrad; they've been a constant companion since. While the university boasts its own stunning landscapes, the mountains hold a special place in my heart. The town itself is a blend of bustling urban energy and serene suburban charm. Its cafés have been the backdrop to countless study sessions fueled by caffeine. A short bus ride or walk takes you to the downtown area, where vintage brick buildings and lively eateries create an atmosphere of vibrancy. This urban energy fades into quiet residential neighborhoods near the library, offering a stark contrast and an invitation to explore. The town is a treasure trove of cherished memories, from late-night chats with friends by the park to movie nights at the university's fancy theater. Yet, it's also remembered for more somber moments, such as late-night reflections by the pond. While watching the pond's inhabitants go about their lives, I've often pondered my own purpose. The mountains, ever-present, have been there to remind me of my resilience. As I walked to a main street, the sun painted the sky with brilliant hues, and I realized I was heading north, towards the mountains. There they were, towering and steadfast, their peaks reaching for the sky. They stirred within me a sense of perseverance, a reminder to keep moving forward, one day at a time.",
            "If you plan on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you won't have any trouble locating it! Public transportation is incredibly accessible and is one of the most popular ways to get around in New York City. Bensonhurt is an urban neighborhood, so you'll still feel like you're in the heart of the city. Expect to see numerous Asian stores during your visit. Over the past couple of decades, Bensonhurt has seen a surge in Asian residents, resulting in an Asian-owned store on nearly every block. Supermarkets and laundromats are particularly common, and they're quite popular among local residents due to their high-quality food, reasonable prices, and convenience. Just around where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes' walk of each other, which makes grocery shopping a breeze! I'm not saying Bensonhurt is exclusively Asian, though; it's quite diverse, with immigrants and their first- and second-generation American children living there. Many of the neighborhood's large and popular businesses are Asian-owned. Additionally, there's a recently renovated park nearby with about ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we're in New York City, the parks are diverse. You'll see people of all backgrounds getting along well. In this neighborhood, there aren't many corporate buildings; instead, you'll find co-op living units or condominium apartments. Most residents live in two-family houses. While most people are friendly, it can be quite noisy. Every day, you'll hear cars blasting music as they drive by, and people often rev their engines loudly, which can wake you up in the morning. If you're visiting at night, be cautious. Bensonhurt is generally safe, but individuals can be unpredictable, and you might encounter people looking for trouble, bullies, or thieves. I've personally experienced physical assault in this neighborhood in the past, but that was many years ago. Recently, there have been incidents of package theft, which is relatively common in this neighborhood. Lastly, while New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, many residents don't follow the rules. Every morning, you'll see dog waste on your way to the train station or supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is finding dog waste everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!",
            "I live in a neighborhood that doesn't have many sidewalks. The terrain is hilly, and my house sits at the peak of the steepest hill in the area. Locals call it the \"workout hill\" because it's a popular spot for joggers. Since there are no sidewalks on my street, everyone walks on the road. The road is a bit rough due to potholes and can be hazardous to drive on. Some of the power lines and telephone wires are quite worn out and look a bit grimy. Our region gets a lot of rain and storms, which often lead to branches and debris falling and damaging the lines. The lines are constantly being repaired, giving them a patchwork appearance. There are numerous tall evergreen trees all around, which people often cut down because they block the view of the ocean. Many of the houses are built high up on the hill with large glass fronted second stories to enjoy the bay view. The sunset is breathtaking when the water seems to glow from below and the sky turns orange. Despite the stunning sunsets, it's often cloudy and damp around here. Moss grows on almost everything it can, including roofs, cars, and railings. I left my car parked in the driveway for a month once, and when I returned, it was covered in moss. It took me three hours to clean it off. There aren't many children around, but there's a school nearby. The neighborhood is mostly made up of older residents, many of whom are retired. Instead of kids, there are a lot of dogs. They often sit in people's lawns or race down the street. If you leave a door or window open, you might find one in your living room like I did. Rabbits are common in the area and can be quite large. They're a nuisance for gardeners because they dig up plant roots and burrow into lawns. My cats love to hunt them, and they've managed to get rid of many of them. We also have a variety of birds, from small sparrows and hummingbirds to the occasional hawk or eagle that gets chased off by the neighborhood crows. There aren't any stores nearby, but if you walk downhill to the waterfront, you can find a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach, but the rocks along the shore are fun to toss into the water. The bay isn't very wide, and you can see the opposite shore clearly through the mist most days.",
            "I live in a classic suburban neighborhood in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so our street sees a bit more traffic than I'd prefer, but other than that, it's a peaceful area. Not many people move in and out, so I'm familiar with most of my neighbors. They keep busy with yard work and other daily tasks. In winter, we enjoy sledding down a hill in our street. Since we live at the front corner of our block, we see neighbors coming and going all day, and we're familiar with the cars in the area. We're cautious about new vehicles. Some neighbors go for walks or walk their dogs, and kids play on their bikes. We're mostly at home as we work from our house. Our family consists of myself, my wife, and our two daughters, ages eleven and fourteen. With us constantly coming and going, everyone is used to our presence. We enjoy playing outside, even in the rain. We sometimes grill on our back deck, which always fills the air with a delicious barbecue scent. Lawn mowers run frequently from March until October. We have many trees, originally a wooded area, providing ample shade and a fall leaf cleanup. The smell of burning leaves indicates the arrival of fall. Lately, winter has been mild, extending our fall season. Our garage is at the back of the house, and we rarely use the front door unless someone knocks, which is uncommon. I enjoy working in the garage on my truck or other projects. With the garage doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays are generally quiet, with Thanksgiving and other holidays seeing some families visiting from out of town, adding extra cars to the area. Overall, I appreciate living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be ideal.",
            "My neighborhood is slap bang in the middle of the high desert, where dirt is king and everything is dusty brown. If you haven't experienced it, you can't grasp the sensation of seeing nothing but dirt, and when we do see a lawn, it's clear that the owner is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first moved here in the 90s, the houses were far and wide, but now it's still the same, with plenty of new additions. It feels like the city is growing bigger every day, but I guess that's the way of the world. The people here are generally friendly, and I'm lucky to have some great neighbors, mostly older folks. The stores around here are mostly chains like Food 4 Less, Smart & Final, and the like. If you're looking for something more upmarket, you'll have to travel a bit. The most common jobs here seem to be in construction, probably because the city is still growing and there's plenty of space to build. That's a bit scary for me, as I came from a big city and I'm not looking to move back. I'm a drywall and T-bar installer myself, so I know the job market firsthand. Our home is a wildlife paradise. We have three kids who love chasing lizards and desert bugs. We've adapted to the wildlife here pretty well. As for attractions, Victorville has its charms. The annual San Bernardino County Fair is definitely worth a visit, and you can't miss the snow-covered mountains in Wrightwood for some winter sports. If you're interested in the natural history and culture, the Victor Valley Museum is a must-see. It houses geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of Victorville's development.",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'd say it's a bit unique. Unlike others who might describe their neighborhood as a residential area with homeowners, mine is more akin to a college campus. The people living in my dormitory, along with the surrounding campus, make up my community and neighborhood. Even though it's not typical, my neighborhood has many similar features to a conventional one. We have houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's start with the houses. My neighborhood has three types: apartments, houses, and dormitories. In apartments, there are usually 2-4 people per room, with 4-6 rooms per floor. On average, each building houses about 20 people. Actual houses are rented by those affiliated with the school, usually alumni, and there are a handful scattered around. Dormitories are the most common housing type, with two people per room and hundreds of students living there. Moving on to the people, my school boasts diversity, and that's reflected in my neighborhood. There are staff members living in houses, new students in dorms, and older students in apartments. We have a mix of cultures and ages here. Lastly, there are plenty of stores and a single park. Stores offer usual dining options and our school's unique merchandise. Anything needed can be found within my neighborhood. Our park is a playground for diverse people, kept clean and safe by the community.",
            "Well, given that I've been living here for about a decade, I reckon I can share some insights. Initially, I was awfully bummed when we moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge. It was a rough transition, and I shed a few tears missing my beloved old neighborhood and friends. But my parents wanted the best for me and my sister, so we made the move to a supposedly \"better\" area with better housing and a more reputable high school. Over time, I adjusted and made new acquaintances, some of whom became friends, and others who turned out to be less so. I never really got to know my neighbors extensively, except for Mr. Glen and his family who live right next door, and Dennis, who’s just a stone's throw away. They've been amazing people to me, almost like extended family, and I truly appreciate their kindness. Remembering Mr. Glen’s wedding, where his new wife, Ms. Veda, tossed the wedding bouquet, and I managed to catch the garter but missed the flowers? It was an unforgettable night, and dancing with Marsharii, one of his daughters, was the cherry on top. I haven’t seen Marsharii since, but I hope she's doing well. Our neighborhood is a bit like a labyrinth, but with a GPS now, I've been exploring more. I've hung out with Kason and Curtis in some parts, and we had tons of fun playing video games and enjoying life. Sometimes, I visit the park to find solace in nature, which really calms my soul. I bring along sticks from Home Depot to practice my balance and my bokken wooden sword if I can. I also enjoy using the basketball and tennis courts, although it’s been a while since I’ve played either sport. My dad taught me and my best friend tennis with Mr. Graves back in the day, and we always had a blast. There’s plenty of fun memories here, and I'm excited about what's to come!",
            "My neighborhood is conveniently close to the college that I attend, which makes living here quite pleasant. The area is predominantly apartment buildings, but there are some restaurants and bars that provide a fun atmosphere without breaking the bank. Recently, one of the bars was renamed, and while it's now a bit pricier, the quality of service and drinks remains good. Most of the people I encounter are either college students or lower-income individuals, as the apartment housing is reasonably priced. An elementary school is nearby, and while I don't know my neighbors, they're generally nice. However, they smoke a lot of weed, so the building management installed an air freshener unit near their door, which my boyfriend and I found amusing. The buildings surrounding me are quite old but may have well-renovated interiors. Down the street, there are new apartments, but I'm not fond of them due to poor construction and high rents. There's a restaurant a few minutes away that serves most food on paper plates and uses a microwave, along with a gas station that's not great for employees. Fortunately, the road has been improved with city funding, adding a nice sidewalk and green spaces. My apartment building is surrounded by trees, and while a few were cut down, there are more than those down the road. Behind my complex is a tree line and another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but the buildings on 43rd street are less appealing due to poor sidewalks and rundown buildings. While the trees hide some of the dilapidated structures, there are criminal incidents at the apartment complex on that street. However, I appreciate my neighborhood because it's affordable and offers plenty of useful amenities, such as the university within walking distance and two bus stops for easy access to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood is filled with duplexes on a cul-de-sac, spaced out like individual homes. Each unit is painted yellow, with white porches and green metal roofs, giving it a distinct look. Most residents are friendly, often gathering at the end of the drive, chatting while kids play with toys, chalk, or fly kites. It's a refreshing change from the modern, tech-filled world. We're bordered by fields and trees, with blue skies and billowing clouds. The only downside? This season, we've been under tornado warnings. Last night, we heard the sirens and had to rush to shelter. I found myself in my bathtub, clutching my little dog, purse, and pillows. My bigger dog stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The storm brought hail, and the road literally steamed after the temperature drop. It was like a scene from a movie—from 92°F to 75°F in minutes. The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement. After the storm, the sun came out, revealing a double rainbow. I quickly grabbed my camera and snapped pictures to share. The neighborhood was quiet until some people returned home. Soon, it was back to normal, with moms and children outside, dinner cooking. It's a friendly community, a huge change from my life back in New Hampshire. I live in a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, like everyone else, but not all apartments are the same inside. Some are quite small. I love walking down the big field behind my house and listening to the giant bullfrog in the morning. It's a small-town vibe with roosters crowing and a nearby farm with a donkey. It's a gem of a neighborhood to be found just outside Charlotte.",
            "When I moved to this neighborhood right before eighth grade, it was a bit of a struggle to make friends at first, but eventually I connected with someone living two houses down and another guy on my street. Neither of them live here anymore, but the memories of those friendships remain. The same folks who lived here when I first arrived are still around. My neighborhood is pretty standard for an American suburban area, filled with two-story houses. On warm weekends, you can hear kids playing outside. Most days, it's quiet. I've never had any issues with my neighbors. They're all quite self-sufficient and helpful when needed. I've ordered numerous packages online without any problems, so I feel secure leaving them on my porch. I trust my neighbors implicitly.\n\nThere's a park just a couple of minutes walk from my house, where I've played basketball, football, and baseball with the neighborhood kids. Some of those games ended with bruises, like the time I got elbowed in the nose while playing football, but the good times outweigh the bad. Now, I visit the park to hang out with my cousin's kids, who love the swings and slides. Seeing them enjoy the park brings back a lot of nostalgia for me.\n\nOur neighborhood is quite diverse, with various cuisines nearby. Within a mile radius, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. Nowadays, many people use food delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get their meals, and fast food joints are easy to find in any suburban area. There are also plenty of pizza places around. The stores here carry everything you need, including multiple dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store. There's even an Indian-owned store if you're feeling adventurous with your cooking or just want some ready-made Indian food.\n\nOverall, I'm quite fond of my neighborhood. Reading about the issues others face with their neighbors on social media and the news makes me grateful for mine.",
            "My neighborhood is a charming little town in South Carolina. It's not too different from others, but it has a notable influence on the agricultural industry. Johnston is famously known as the Peach Capital of the World, a title proudly displayed on the welcoming sign. The town is primarily farmland, with peach orchards and cattle pastures taking center stage. Houses, which are usually two-story with either metal or gray shingle roofs, are spaced out, with many located further back to allow for front fields to be used for farming. In the town center, there's a single stop sign at a four-way intersection where you'll find the only stores. There are three places to grab a meal on the go: Hong Kong, a family-owned Chinese restaurant; Fiesta Mexican Restaurant; and Gary's, a small burger place. A pizzeria used to be there, but it closed down recently. There's also a small family pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug, renowned for their Cherry Coca-Cola. The only grocery store is Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, but many residents prefer to shop at a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for most of their groceries. The most popular store is Dollar General, which is always bustling. Across from the furniture store is a pet grooming business called Clark's Cuts and Kennels, offering services like daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and bathing. Both a doctor's office and a vet clinic are located away from town, though they are well-equipped to serve the town's residents. Johnston Elementary School is the only school in the town, with students attending middle and high school in a nearby town after fifth grade. There are no parks, but the town is working on creating a 2.5-acre recreational area to enhance family activities and attract more visitors. Despite the lack of entertainment options like movie theaters, bowling alleys, or hangout spots, Johnston is a pleasant town, small enough to be passed through quickly!",
            "The first time I heard of this place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a bit unexpected. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. None of my friends had heard about it either. Maybe it's the daily grind. A few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night because of the high cost of living. We've all learned to be thrifty over the years. You start to appreciate the smell of vintage toys and secondhand clothes. You don't notice it as much in adulthood. Some of us take up smoking, or we just get used to it. But the flea market is always present. The scent of adulthood lingers in old magazines piled on a closed piano. It sticks to the leather and won't go away, even after you clean. Here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start from the far end, you can visit two charity thrift shops, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling, with cars and people filling the streets every morning, but it's quiet inside the thrift stores. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store remains silent. It's a tranquil place to spend an afternoon. Each year, the city seems to grow busier. Cars and people flood it constantly. It's a developing city, they say. With one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still growing, showing signs of its struggles. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is focused on their own goals, and no one asks much of you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a bit concerned seems like you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here. You can maintain your distance as long as you want, and the city will keep moving like the waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something happening. In a way, I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl, but it's people like my neighbors who make me feel like I haven't completely ruined my life.",
            "The place I call home is your typical cookie cutter suburbia. The most noticeable thing about my neighborhood is the strict presence of a homeowner's association (HOA). The moment you step in, you're greeted by well-maintained single-family homes—all thanks to the HOA's meticulous upkeep. The front yards are all similar, with a small patch of grass, decorative pebbles, and short driveways. Occasionally, you'll spot a small tree. Every house has a two-car garage. As you drive through, you'll notice newly paved concrete roads in pristine condition, with no potholes in sight. Most houses are single-story, though you'll sometimes see two-story ones. Instead of individual mailboxes in front of each house, we have a communal setup at the end of the street, with large groupings of mailboxes and two larger lockers for packages. This uniformity is another attribute of the HOA's influence. My neighborhood is on the outskirts of the nearby city, making it a blend of rural and suburban living. This means we have plenty of land for various activities. We have multiple community pools, walking trails for dog walks or evening strolls, and no need to visit a park for exercise. Most residents are retired, with a small mix of middle-aged and young professionals. The city itself is surprisingly large in population but retains a small-town feel. We have most of the amenities you'd expect—like a single mall that's not huge but gets the job done. It takes about 15 minutes to drive to significant areas, where you'll find a variety of stores, from high-end grocery stores with organic options to bargain outlets with minimal staff. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have great facilities like pools and walking trails, and while we're not next door to major shopping, a quick car ride gets you there.",
            "I reside in a small Midwestern town, just on the outskirts of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, located on the east side, is the town's most economically disadvantaged area. Most houses here are rented out to or owned by low-income individuals. Despite this, it's not an unpleasant place to live. My neighbors are generally friendly folks who greet you with a smile as you walk down the street. While crime rates are slightly higher than other parts of town, they're still manageable. We've seen a few violent incidents here over the past decade, including a shooting and a homicide within a few blocks of my home. Fortunately, our family hasn't been directly impacted by crime. Our close neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. The opioid epidemic has hit this town hard, with many lives lost due to fentanyl overdoses. However, there are resources available to combat this issue, like addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends. Despite these challenges, the town has many positive aspects. My son's elementary school has excellent staff, and he's thriving despite having special needs. The school's positive atmosphere has prevented any bullying. The PTO organizes multiple events to promote family involvement and educational progress. Since over 20% of the town's population lives below the poverty line, the school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students. No child or family is treated as \"less than\" due to financial constraints. School fees, supplies, and field trip costs are affordable. The City Council has made many improvements to the town's appearance, like repaving roads and refurbishing city parks, but most of these improvements have been focused on the center and the west side, where shopping areas are located. The east side, where I live, tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for us. Nevertheless, I enjoy living here. People are friendly, the schools are great, and there are sufficient shopping options. Our home might not be worth much, but it's comfortable and adequate. Our family has been living here for over 16 years, and we can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is a cultural treasure trove, nestled on a hill, encircled by structures steeped in history. I call home a 7-story apartment building, just across the old live theatre, and a block down, there's a charming arcade bar that attracts all sorts of folks on warm summer evenings. On weekends in June and July, you might witness a line of people eager to enter. A few blocks up, lies the nearest city park, quite spacious for its location. Concrete steps surround the park, and during the harsh winter months, homeless individuals set up their tents in neat rows, close together to keep warm. Though it doesn't snow much, torrential rains in mid-winter make it challenging to stay cozy. They're near enough to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I adore about my city isn't the historical architecture, though it's impressive, but the people. Hilltop, once infamous for gang violence, still echoes with tales of the federal government's and DEA's efforts to clean its streets. Despite being one of the rougher 'hoods' in the city, the people here work hard to keep it tidy and still care deeply about their community. However, there's a lingering air of caution, especially for those who are white, to avoid the Hill after dark. I believe this warning is a remnant of the past, flavored with social conditioning. Perhaps my dark enough appearance allows me to blend in or maybe Hilltop perceives me as one of their own, someone acutely aware of the racial, cultural, and fearful assumptions that cloud our society. Regardless of where I roam, Hilltop will always be home. I feel alive walking its streets at night, receiving kindness from strangers more readily than threats. It's a place where laundry owners extend their hours to help out, and even on the greyest nights, someone might stop to offer a $5, complimenting my beauty and value.",
            "I call my home rural America, nestled in small-town Michigan. We transition from expansive farmlands to picturesque tourist cities, where big city conveniences like Walmart, Target, or Applebee’s are hard to find. Everywhere I need to go requires a drive, but I'm lucky to live in one of the most stunning places on Earth, surrounded by water. Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix flank my city, offering beaches for toe-dipping at every turn. My neighborhood encapsulates the essence of small-town living. Houses aren’t cookie-cutter or stacked, but rather older homes, some updated, some with aluminum siding. Most have full basements visible from the road, with yards featuring trampolines, playsets, gardens, and fences for pets. The houses reflect the hardworking people who call this place home, either raising families or having done so. Kids often play outside, and neighbors walk dogs, bike, or rollerblade. Neighbors recognize each other, and the lawns are well-maintained. It's not a neighborhood for show, but a serene, safe haven, perfect for family life. Essential services like the county sheriff’s department, health department, recycling center, baseball fields, and a small-town airport are nearby. You can hear small planes taking off and landing, and kids riding bikes to the park just eight blocks away. It's a great place to call home."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

While some areas are ethnically distinct, they are often just a few miles away, but driving a mere 10 miles can take up to two hours due to heavy traffic, especially during peak hours. Public transportation isn't heavily used, and traffic congestion is notorious.

My place has a small yard out front and a driveway to the left. It's like a throwback to a time when living in the suburbs was the American dream, and many neighborhoods like mine still hold onto that dream. The folks here aren't as optimistic as they used to be, and yard maintenance isn't what it once was, but there's still a car or two in every drive.

            "The first thing you should know about Portland, Oregon is that it's definitely \"weird\". The tongue-in-cheek town motto, plastered on the back of a building that doubles as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, and a place that flirts with the law on most of its enterprises, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, this is a reminder of the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less well-known and less pricey, fostering creative and unique subcultures. For others, it's an invitation - come to Portland, where being weird is seen as a badge of honor. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the non-stop construction of condos, Portland remains weird. Being weird isn't about accepting everything, but it is about accepting the unusual. It doesn't mean we lack modern conveniences or face the same issues as the rest of the country. Like everyone else, we buy a lot from China. Weirdness comes in countless forms, and Portland has plenty of \"normal\" too - yoga, hipsters, business professionals. Perhaps weirdness is just a matter of taking it all less seriously. In my neighborhood, and many other Portland neighborhoods, you'll find colorful houses, gardens with flowers, herbs, and vegetables, and free boxes in the summer. These free boxes are usually cardboard containing items someone's getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They hold magical treasures, perfect for the passerby, often enough. Free boxes often contain clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of wandering through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about - to me, at least, but I'm just one of the many different weirdos here. Some people I live among would never dream of picking clothes from a sidewalk box. They'd rather go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is filled with people who love all sorts of things. Many dream about pursuing their dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug issues are often rooted in mental health struggles, and the constant rain and dreary clouds can exacerbate this. Portland also has a homelessness problem, which no one seems to know how to fix. Our social services are better than in many places, but they're still not enough. The local population swings between care and resentment. In this, Portland is not weird at all.",
            "The mountains have always been there, looming over the north, constantly witnessing the sun's daily journey. Even when I'm caught up in work or life, they stand firm, unyielding and unaffected by life's challenges. On days when stress and worry overwhelm me, they call out to me, offering solace and strength when I turn to them. I first noticed them when I moved here for my undergrad, and they've been captivating me ever since. While the university and town have their own charms, it's the mountains that hold a special place in my heart. The town, with its blend of urban and suburban life, offers a unique atmosphere. There are countless cafes where I've spent many hours studying, and the downtown area, with its vintage brick buildings, has a bustling energy that's almost magical. Just beyond the library, you can find a serene, small-town vibe. This mix of environments creates a wonderful cityscape, beckoning exploration. Each part of town holds cherished memories for me - from late-night walks with friends to catching movies in a fancy theater. But it also holds harsh memories, as all places do. The ponds, especially, have been a place for deep reflection and late-night existential crises. Watching the pond creatures live their lives has made me ponder my own purpose in life. I've walked past the park and houses, until I reached the main street. There, the sun painted the sky with its brilliant rays, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was heading north. And there they were, as always - the strong, imposing mountains painting the sky, giving me the strength to carry on, one day at a time.",
            "If you're thinking of dropping by Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, don't worry, it's super accessible! Public transport is a breeze, which is a big plus in NYC. Bensonhurt is a bit of an urban jungle, so you'll still feel like you're in the city. Be ready to spot plenty of Asian stores around. Over the past couple of decades, Bensonhurt has seen a surge of Asian residents, which means you'll find at least one Asian-owned business every block. Supermarkets and laundromats are the most common, and locals love them because the food quality is top-notch, prices are cheap, and they're super convenient. I've got four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of my place! Not that Bensonhurt is all Asian, though; it's incredibly diverse. Most big local businesses are Asian-owned, but there's also a newly renovated park nearby with plenty of courts for all sorts of sports, playgrounds, and a water fountain. NYC parks are always diverse and welcoming. There aren't many big corporate buildings; mostly you'll find co-op living or condo apartments, with the majority of homes being two-family houses. Most people are friendly, but it can get noisy, with cars blasting music and people revving their engines all the time. Be cautious at night; the neighborhood is generally safe, but people can be unpredictable, and you might encounter bullies and thieves. I've had my share of trouble here, like being physically assaulted years ago and having packages stolen. Package theft is common, and there's also a lot of dog waste around. It's my biggest pet peeve! Just be careful and keep your shoes clean!",
            "Where I live, sidewalks are a scarcity. The streets slope downwards, and my home sits at the highest point of the steepest hill in the neighborhood, earning it the nickname \"workout hill\" for the joggers who pound the pavement daily. With no sidewalks on my street, everyone walks in the road. The surfaces are rough in places, making it a bit treacherous to drive on. The telecommunication and electric lines overhead are a tattered mess, constantly being repaired due to regular rain and storms. Trees, especially evergreens, are everywhere, but locals detest them for obstructing the ocean view. Houses are built high up on the hill, with expansive glass-fronted second stories lining the crest, all vying for a glimpse of the bay. Sunsets are breathtaking when the water is illuminated from below and the sky turns orange, but clouds often obscure the view, and moss grows on everything, even my car. Kids are rare, and dogs and rabbits are more common. There are no stores nearby, but a short hike down to the waterfront leads to a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. The bay is not wide, but the rocks along the shore are fun to toss into the water, and you can see the opposite shore on clear days.",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area of a small southern town in Tennessee, nestled between two state highways which brings a bit more traffic than I'd ideally prefer. However, aside from that, it’s a quiet locale. Not many folks move in or out, so I've become accustomed to the folks who live in the neighborhood. Most people keep busy with yard work and daily chores, while others enjoy walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids zip around on their bikes as you'd expect. My family and I are often at home since we work from our house; my wife and I, along with our daughters, ages eleven and fourteen, are a familiar sight to the neighborhood. We engage in outdoor activities, even in the rain, and occasionally we grill outside on our back deck, filling the air with the pleasant aroma of barbecue. Lawn mowers are a common sound from March through October, as neighbors keep their grass trimmed. The neighborhood is shaded by trees, which were originally part of a wooded area, but that also means dealing with leaves in the fall, which we rake and burn annually. I find the smell of burning leaves a comforting sign that fall has arrived. Lately, we've had little winter, making it seem like a prolonged fall. Our garage is at the back, so we don't use the front door much unless someone knocks, which is rare. I enjoy working in the garage on my truck or other projects, as it makes me feel more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays are quite quiet here, but during Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, and Christmas, you’ll see extra cars parked as neighbors visit with out-of-town family. Overall, I enjoy living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is smack dab in the high desert, where dirt is the reigning color. Unless you've been here, you might not understand the feeling of constant brown. When you do see a lawn, you know that person is investing a fortune in its upkeep. Back in the 90s, houses were scattered far and wide. Now, the layout is similar, but new additions are popping up. Truth is, this place is starting to look more and more like a city, and I suppose that's how it goes everywhere. Most people here are friendly, but just like any city, there are good areas and not-so-good ones. In my neighborhood, I'm surrounded by friendly old folks—it's quite nice. The stores here are mostly chain places like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you're looking for upscale, you'll have to travel. I don't often see stores like Whole Foods around here.\n\nMost prominent jobs in my city, based on my observations, are in construction. I think it's because this place is still developing, with a lot of room for building. That bothers me a bit; I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and don't want to go back. Speaking of construction, that's what my full-time job is about—drywall and T-bar installation.\n\nWhat I love about my home is the variety of animals. People come here for the desert's stark beauty, and the climate and topography create unique ecosystems that need protection and are home to diverse wildlife. My family and I have gotten used to the wildlife. My three kids are obsessed with lizards and desert bugs; they're outside now trying to catch some specimens.\n\nAs for attractions, Victorville offers some unique experiences. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with the San Bernardino County Fair. It's a great time to experience Victorville's way of life. You could also head to nearby Wrightwood to see snow-covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons. If you're interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert, the Victor Valley Museum is a must-visit. It houses geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of Victorville's development.",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'd say it's a bit different from the typical image most people have. Instead of your traditional residential area with homeowners leading their individual lives, my neighborhood is the college campus where I live. The people who live in my dormitory make up my community, and the surrounding campus also contributes to this feeling of neighborhood, though to a lesser degree. Despite this uniqueness, my neighborhood shares some standard features with other neighborhoods. It, too, includes houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's start by talking about the \"houses\" in my neighborhood. To understand my neighborhood's housing, it's important to know the types of houses that populate it. There are three main types of housing: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory houses. In the apartments, each room usually houses 2-4 people, with about 4-6 rooms on each floor. A building can hold around 20 people on average. Actual houses are scattered throughout the neighborhood and are typically rented by school affiliates, usually alumni. These houses are usually 2-4 bedrooms. Dormitory houses are by far the most common, accommodating hundreds of students. In these, you'll find two people sharing a room, with the exception of a few. Now, let's move on to the people. My college prides itself on diversity, and this is evident in the makeup of my neighborhood. The diverse cultures and ages that live here are one of the things that make it special. Professional staff members tend to live in the houses available for rent, while newer students stay in dormitory-style housing, and older students live in apartments. To talk about the people in my neighborhood would take too long, so let's move on to the stores and parks. Since my school is self-contained, it offers a variety of stores, including dining options and the school's unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. This means that everything needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries. Additionally, my neighborhood has a park that serves as a playground for all the diverse people who live here. This park is kept clean and safe by everyone in the community!",
            "Well, having spent a decade here, I can share some of my experiences. When I first arrived in this neighborhood, I was quite down because I was leaving behind the familiarity of Riverdale for Stockbridge. I cried, as much as I loved my old home and friends, but my parents wanted a better environment for us. The move to a more upmarket neighborhood was a significant change, but it came with its benefits, like a better high school and less “ghetto” surroundings. Over time, I adjusted, made new friends, and even some enemies. I got to know a few neighbors well, like Mr. Glen and his family, and Dennis. They’ve become like family to me, and I deeply appreciate their presence.\n\nOne memorable moment was attending Mr. Glen and Ms. Veda's wedding – a joyful event where I caught the wedding bouquet's garter but missed the flowers! We danced and had a great time, especially with their daughter, Marsharii. I haven’t seen her since, but I hope she’s doing well.\n\nThe neighborhood is a bit like a maze, but I have a GPS to guide me through. I’ve explored only a little, mainly with Kason and Curtis. We used to enjoy video games and nature walks, which somehow soothe my soul. I also enjoy practicing my balance with sticks from Home Depot and, if I can, my bokken wooden sword. The basketball and tennis courts are there if I ever want to pick up those sports again. My dad and best friend used to train with Mr. Graves in tennis, and it was always a fun, challenging experience. There are plenty of enjoyable memories here, and I’m sure many more are yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is conveniently close to my college, which is why I appreciate living here. There's mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars nearby that aren't too pricey. One of the bars just changed its name and is a bit pricier, but the service and drinks aren't bad. Most people are friendly, with many being college students or lower income due to affordable housing. A nearby elementary school means there are a lot of kids around. I don't know my neighbors, and that's fine by me. They smoke a lot of weed, which led to the building's management placing an air freshener unit near their door. I think it's funny, but also slightly insulting. The buildings here are usually old but might have nice interiors. Down the street, there are newer apartments, but I think they're cheaply built. Their rent is high, but they're near campus, so management can charge more. There's a cheap restaurant around five minutes away that uses paper plates and microwaves most of its food. Across from it is a gas station I've heard isn't great to work at. The area has improved with road repairs from the city, adding a nice sidewalk, grass, and a nicer look. Behind my apartment complex, there's a tree line and another set of apartments. I live on 42nd Street, and just behind it is 43rd Street, which isn't as nice. The sidewalks are poor quality and buildings look rundown, with many trees to hide their condition. Crime has occurred at apartment complexes on 43rd Street, but I can't blame them alone. Across the street from me, there's also a problematic apartment building with a transient population. Despite this, I like living here. It's affordable, and I have easy access to useful amenities like the university and two bus stops. I can get to the store and downtown with ease.",
            "My neighborhood is a peaceful cul-de-sac filled with yellow duplexes, each with white porches and green metal roofs. We're tucked away from the hustle of the modern world, with fields and trees surrounding us, and blue skies dotted with white clouds. It's a bit like stepping back in time, with almost everyone being friends with each other. On some evenings, we gather at the end of the driveway, chatting as the kids play. Last night, we faced a unique challenge: a tornado warning and actual sirens. I huddled in the bathtub with my little dog and a few pillows, while my bigger dog stayed in the living room, nervous and barking. The neighborhood was eerily quiet, save for the sound of large hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road was steaming from the temperature change, and the hail melted immediately on the hot pavement. A double rainbow appeared, and I snapped pictures to share with friends and family. The streets remained quiet for a while, and then it was back to business as usual. I love this community, especially the southern accents, having moved from NH to NC. I live in a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, as do most of my neighbors. Despite the houses looking alike, the interiors vary. I enjoy walking to the nearby pond, where I've seen deer and heard bullfrogs in the morning. It's a fantastic place to live, just forty minutes from Charlotte. Each morning is greeted by roosters crowing from the nearby farms. There's even a donkey at a nearby farm that lets us know he's there with his evening braying. I consider myself lucky to have found this cozy neighborhood.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just as I was about to start eighth grade. Making friends initially was tough, but I eventually became close with someone who lived two houses down and another guy on my street. They've since moved away, but the memories remain. Most of the original residents are still here, and my neighborhood is typical of any American suburban area. It's filled with two-story houses, and on warm weekends or nice days, you can hear kids playing outside. The neighborhood is usually quiet, and I've never had issues with any neighbors. I trust them, and I've never had any trouble with packages being stolen from my porch. The park a couple of minutes away from my house is where I've spent countless hours. I've played basketball, football, and baseball with the neighborhood kids, and although I have one bad memory from getting elbowed in the nose playing football, the good times outweigh the bad. Now, I often visit the park to spend time with my cousin's kids who enjoy playing on the swings and slides. The park evokes nostalgic feelings, as it's where I made many of my childhood memories. The neighborhood is diverse, with a variety of food options nearby, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants, all accessible via delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash. There's a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store on the same street, along with a diverse range of stores, including an Indian-owned shop. Overall, I'm grateful for my neighborhood as it's a safe and comfortable place to live, unlike some of the horror stories I've seen on news and social media.",
            "My neighborhood, Johnston, is a charming little town nestled in South Carolina. Like many others in the region, it doesn't exactly stand out, but it's a significant player in the agricultural scene. The town is famously known as the Peach Capital of the World, a title proudly displayed on the welcoming sign. The landscape is dominated by vast farmlands, either filled with peach trees or cattle. Houses are scattered, usually two stories high with metal roofs to beat the summer heat or gray shingles for a traditional look. Most homes are tucked back from the road, allowing the front fields to serve as pastures for animals or crops. In the main town area, there's a single stop sign at a four-way intersection where all the stores are located. You can grab \"fast food\" from Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's burger joint. A former pizzeria has since closed down. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a family-owned pharmacy, is famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola. The Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, is the only grocery store, though most residents prefer to shop at a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville. The Dollar General is the busiest store in town, offering a wide range of everyday items. Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman, has been a town staple for years and offers furniture delivery. Attached to the furniture store is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet grooming service offering a variety of pet care services. Both a doctor's practice and a veterinary clinic are located away from the main town area, but they are well-equipped to serve the residents. Johnston Elementary School is the only school in town, with students transferring to the next town for middle and high school. There are no parks, but a 2.5-acre recreational area is being developed. The town is so small that you could breeze through it without noticing, but it's quite cozy nevertheless!",
            "The first time I learned about my place, I caught a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was quite surprising. The rent for almost every apartment nearby was over a grand a month. I'd never heard a whisper about it, and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the harsh reality. I know a few of my buddies are so stressed out they cry themselves to sleep over the costs. Things are expensive, but we've managed to be thrifty over the years. You start to appreciate the nostalgic smell of flea market toys and second-hand clothes. You smell less in adulthood. You might pick up the habit of smoking, or you might just be used to the state of things. But the flea market always finds its way in. The scent of adulthood lingers in the dusty magazines on a closed piano and clings to the leather, even after washing. Here, within walking distance, there are three thrift stores. If you start from the edge, you can pop into two charity shops, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling, cars and people fill the streets daily, but you'll never hear it inside the thrifts. Not a soul nor a sound from the outside world can penetrate the silent stores. It's a great place to lose an afternoon. Each year, the city grows denser with people and cars. They claim it's a developing city, with an online empire headquartered here for e-commerce and delivery. It's still showing signs of growth pains, much like New York. Everyone's focused on their own goals, and they don't ask much from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a bit concerned means you genuinely care. You don't pry into anyone's life here. You can keep your shell as long as you want, and the city will just roll along like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to call home. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always some sort of music or action. We're not just a bunch of strangers in an apartment building; we're a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate life's milestones, and help each other when possible. In a way, I feel lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I make sure to tidy up after myself and leave them some food, and they do the same for me. We share mail, and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl, but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't make a mistake in choosing to live here.",
            "My neighborhood is your typical cookie cutter suburbia, but with a unique twist. The homeowner's association is very strict here, which means every house is well-maintained and uniform. There are no individual mailboxes; instead, there's a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street, and two larger lockers for packages. The houses are mostly single-story, but you'll find a mix of both. The neighborhood is located on the edge of a nearby city, making it partially rural and partially suburban. There's plenty of land, including community pools and walking trails, so you can get your exercise right in your neighborhood. It's mainly inhabited by retired folks and a small mix of middle-aged and young professionals. The city itself is surprisingly large in population but retains a small-town feel. There's a single mall for shopping, and it's a 15-minute drive to get there. It offers everything from high-end grocery stores to bargain outlets. Overall, it's a safe, well-maintained neighborhood with a lot of nice amenities like pools and walking trails. Although we're not right next door to major shopping, you can easily hop in a car and get to any major chain you'd like.",
            "I reside in a small Midwestern town situated just on the outskirts of a major city's suburban areas. My immediate neighborhood, located on the east side of town, is recognized as the most economically disadvantaged part of the town. Property values are generally lower, with most houses being either rented to or owned by individuals with lower incomes. Despite this, the area is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are typically friendly and will often greet me with a smile as I walk down the street. While crime rates are slightly higher compared to other parts of town, they are still low. Over the past decade, there have been a few violent incidents, including shootings and a homicide, within a few blocks of my home. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a nearby bar last year. Thankfully, our family has not been directly impacted by crime beyond the occasional item disappearing from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. The town I live in has been significantly affected by the ongoing \"opioid epidemic\" that has impacted many parts of the United States. Unfortunately, many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are numerous resources available in our town to combat this issue, including addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, the town has many positive aspects. My son's elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. My son, despite having special needs, has not faced any bullying due to the school's incredibly positive atmosphere and loves it there. We have an active PTO that organizes multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town's population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring that no child ever goes hungry. No child or family is treated as \"less than\" due to their inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Most of these improvements have been concentrated in the town center and on the west side, where all the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side, where I live, often feels neglected, which is a point of contention for my neighbors. Overall, I enjoy living in this town. The people are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options to meet my family's needs, and while our home may not be worth much, it is comfortable and adequate. We have lived here for over 16 years and cannot envision living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is rich in culture. It's situated on a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical significance. I reside in a 7-story apartment building right across from the old live Theatre, and a block down from The Hill is a quaint arcade bar that draws diverse crowds on warm summer nights. On weekends in June and July, you often see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park, quite large for its location. Surrounding the park is concrete, with tall steps poured into the wall. During winter, homeless people set up their tents in neat rows, using the central location to stay warmer despite the lack of snow and the cold rain. They're also close to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city, though, isn't the historic buildings or the architecture scattered across the rolling hills leading to the ocean. What I love is the culture of the people themselves. Hilltop was once notorious for gang violence, and even today, stories about the federal government and DEA efforts to clean the streets are passed down from generation to generation. Despite it being considered one of the roughest neighborhoods, the people here work hard to keep it clean. They still care about what happens in their city and on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark, a warning that feels like a remnant of the past, tainted by social conditioning. Maybe it's that I'm dark enough to pass as less white, or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who understands the reminders of racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions made out of ignorance and fear. No matter where I go, Hilltop feels like home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have offered me a jacket or a kind word more than they would rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners stay open a few extra minutes for me to charge my phone when I have nowhere else to escape the rain. It's a place where I've sat, feeling invisible, huddled against concrete storefronts on the greyest nights, only to have someone stop, look me in the eye, and hand me $5, telling me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I hail from rural America, nestled within the small, picturesque town of Michigan. My locale is a delightful blend of farmland and tourist havens, with no big city malls, Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s in sight. You've got to drive to get anywhere, but the beauty is unparalleled. Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix flank the town, offering a serene coastline and inviting beaches. My neighborhood embodies the quintessential small-town vibe. Houses aren't stacked or cookie-cutter; they're older, with some having been updated, and many sporting full basements visible from the road. Aluminum siding and a rainbow of colors adorn the homes, each with yards featuring trampolines, play areas, gardens, and fences for pets. Middle America is epitomized here, with hardworking families raising or having raised their kids. Kids darting up and down the streets, and neighbors walking dogs, biking, and rollerblading are common sights. You recognize who fits in and who doesn't. Neighbors wave and smile, with lawns well-maintained and free of fall leaves. Our town is not flashy but safe and inviting, representing what people seek in life—a peaceful haven. The county sheriff’s department and jail are nearby, along with the health department, city recycling center, baseball and softball fields, and a small airport. You can hear planes taking off and landing while enjoying ice cream from the local shop or riding bikes to the park. My kids can even ride their bikes downtown. It's truly a great place to call home."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "The first thing you should know about Portland, Oregon is that it's definitely \"weird\". The tongue-in-cheek town motto, plastered on the back of a building that doubles as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, and a place that flirts with the law on most of its enterprises, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, this is a reminder of the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less well-known and less pricey, fostering creative and unique subcultures. For others, it's an invitation - come to Portland, where being weird is seen as a badge of honor. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the non-stop construction of condos, Portland remains weird. Being weird isn't about accepting everything, but it is about accepting the unusual. It doesn't mean we lack modern conveniences or face the same issues as the rest of the country. Like everyone else, we buy a lot from China. Weirdness comes in countless forms, and Portland has plenty of \"normal\" too - yoga, hipsters, business professionals. Perhaps weirdness is just a matter of taking it all less seriously. In my neighborhood, and many other Portland neighborhoods, you'll find colorful houses, gardens with flowers, herbs, and vegetables, and free boxes in the summer.

Our social services are better than in many places, but they're still not enough. The local population swings between care and resentment. In this, Portland is not weird at all.",
            "The mountains have always been there, looming over the north, constantly witnessing the sun's daily journey. Even when I'm caught up in work or life, they stand firm, unyielding and unaffected by life's challenges. On days when stress and worry overwhelm me, they call out to me, offering solace and strength when I turn to them. I first noticed them when I moved here for my undergrad, and they've been captivating me ever since. While the university and town have their own charms, it's the mountains that hold a special place in my heart. The town, with its blend of urban and suburban life, offers a unique atmosphere. There are countless cafes where I've spent many hours studying, and the downtown area, with its vintage brick buildings, has a bustling energy that's almost magical. Just beyond the library, you can find a serene, small-town vibe. This mix of environments creates a wonderful cityscape, beckoning exploration. Each part of town holds cherished memories for me - from late-night walks with friends to catching movies in a fancy theater. But it also holds harsh memories, as all places do. The ponds, especially, have been a place for deep reflection and late-night existential crises. Watching the pond creatures live their lives has made me ponder my own purpose in life. I've walked past the park and houses, until I reached the main street. There, the sun painted the sky with its brilliant rays, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was heading north. And there they were, as always - the strong, imposing mountains painting the sky, giving me the strength to carry on, one day at a time.",
            "If you're thinking of dropping by Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, don't worry, it's super accessible! Public transport is a breeze, which is a big plus in NYC. Bensonhurt is a bit of an urban jungle, so you'll still feel like you're in the city. Be ready to spot plenty of Asian stores around. Over the past couple of decades, Bensonhurt has seen a surge of Asian residents, which means you'll find at least one Asian-owned business every block. Supermarkets and laundromats are the most common, and locals love them because the food quality is top-notch, prices are cheap, and they're super convenient. I've got four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of my place! Not that Bensonhurt is all Asian, though; it's incredibly diverse. Most big local businesses are Asian-owned, but there's also a newly renovated park nearby with plenty of courts for all sorts of sports, playgrounds, and a water fountain. NYC parks are always diverse and welcoming. There aren't many big corporate buildings; mostly you'll find co-op living or condo apartments, with the majority of homes being two-family houses. Most people are friendly, but it can get noisy, with cars blasting music and people revving their engines all the time. Be cautious at night; the neighborhood is generally safe, but people can be unpredictable, and you might encounter bullies and thieves. I've had my share of trouble here, like being physically assaulted years ago and having packages stolen. Package theft is common, and there's also a lot of dog waste around. It's my biggest pet peeve! Just be careful and keep your shoes clean!",
            "Where I live, sidewalks are a scarcity. The streets slope downwards, and my home sits at the highest point of the steepest hill in the neighborhood, earning it the nickname \"workout hill\" for the joggers who pound the pavement daily. With no sidewalks on my street, everyone walks in the road. The surfaces are rough in places, making it a bit treacherous to drive on. The telecommunication and electric lines overhead are a tattered mess, constantly being repaired due to regular rain and storms. Trees, especially evergreens, are everywhere, but locals detest them for obstructing the ocean view. Houses are built high up on the hill, with expansive glass-fronted second stories lining the crest, all vying for a glimpse of the bay. Sunsets are breathtaking when the water is illuminated from below and the sky turns orange, but clouds often obscure the view, and moss grows on everything, even my car. Kids are rare, and dogs and rabbits are more common. There are no stores nearby, but a short hike down to the waterfront leads to a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. The bay is not wide, but the rocks along the shore are fun to toss into the water, and you can see the opposite shore on clear days.",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area of a small southern town in Tennessee, nestled between two state highways which brings a bit more traffic than I'd ideally prefer. However, aside from that, it’s a quiet locale. Not many folks move in or out, so I've become accustomed to the folks who live in the neighborhood. Most people keep busy with yard work and daily chores, while others enjoy walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids zip around on their bikes as you'd expect. My family and I are often at home since we work from our house; my wife and I, along with our daughters, ages eleven and fourteen, are a familiar sight to the neighborhood. We engage in outdoor activities, even in the rain, and occasionally we grill outside on our back deck, filling the air with the pleasant aroma of barbecue. Lawn mowers are a common sound from March through October, as neighbors keep their grass trimmed. The neighborhood is shaded by trees, which were originally part of a wooded area, but that also means dealing with leaves in the fall, which we rake and burn annually. I find the smell of burning leaves a comforting sign that fall has arrived. Lately, we've had little winter, making it seem like a prolonged fall. Our garage is at the back, so we don't use the front door much unless someone knocks, which is rare. I enjoy working in the garage on my truck or other projects, as it makes me feel more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays are quite quiet here, but during Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, and Christmas, you’ll see extra cars parked as neighbors visit with out-of-town family. Overall, I enjoy living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is smack dab in the high desert, where dirt is the reigning color. Unless you've been here, you might not understand the feeling of constant brown. When you do see a lawn, you know that person is investing a fortune in its upkeep. Back in the 90s, houses were scattered far and wide. Now, the layout is similar, but new additions are popping up. Truth is, this place is starting to look more and more like a city, and I suppose that's how it goes everywhere. Most people here are friendly, but just like any city, there are good areas and not-so-good ones. In my neighborhood, I'm surrounded by friendly old folks—it's quite nice. The stores here are mostly chain places like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you're looking for upscale, you'll have to travel. I don't often see stores like Whole Foods around here.\n\nMost prominent jobs in my city, based on my observations, are in construction. I think it's because this place is still developing, with a lot of room for building. That bothers me a bit; I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and don't want to go back. Speaking of construction, that's what my full-time job is about—drywall and T-bar installation.\n\nWhat I love about my home is the variety of animals. People come here for the desert's stark beauty, and the climate and topography create unique ecosystems that need protection and are home to diverse wildlife. My family and I have gotten used to the wildlife. My three kids are obsessed with lizards and desert bugs; they're outside now trying to catch some specimens.\n\nAs for attractions, Victorville offers some unique experiences. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with the San Bernardino County Fair. It's a great time to experience Victorville's way of life. You could also head to nearby Wrightwood to see snow-covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons. If you're interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert, the Victor Valley Museum is a must-visit. It houses geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of Victorville's development.",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'd say it's a bit different from the typical image most people have. Instead of your traditional residential area with homeowners leading their individual lives, my neighborhood is the college campus where I live. The people who live in my dormitory make up my community, and the surrounding campus also contributes to this feeling of neighborhood, though to a lesser degree. Despite this uniqueness, my neighborhood shares some standard features with other neighborhoods. It, too, includes houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's start by talking about the \"houses\" in my neighborhood. To understand my neighborhood's housing, it's important to know the types of houses that populate it. There are three main types of housing: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory houses. In the apartments, each room usually houses 2-4 people, with about 4-6 rooms on each floor. A building can hold around 20 people on average. Actual houses are scattered throughout the neighborhood and are typically rented by school affiliates, usually alumni. These houses are usually 2-4 bedrooms. Dormitory houses are by far the most common, accommodating hundreds of students. In these, you'll find two people sharing a room, with the exception of a few. Now, let's move on to the people. My college prides itself on diversity, and this is evident in the makeup of my neighborhood. The diverse cultures and ages that live here are one of the things that make it special. Professional staff members tend to live in the houses available for rent, while newer students stay in dormitory-style housing, and older students live in apartments. To talk about the people in my neighborhood would take too long, so let's move on to the stores and parks. Since my school is self-contained, it offers a variety of stores, including dining options and the school's unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. This means that everything needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries. Additionally, my neighborhood has a park that serves as a playground for all the diverse people who live here. This park is kept clean and safe by everyone in the community!",
            "Well, having spent a decade here, I can share some of my experiences. When I first arrived in this neighborhood, I was quite down because I was leaving behind the familiarity of Riverdale for Stockbridge. I cried, as much as I loved my old home and friends, but my parents wanted a better environment for us. The move to a more upmarket neighborhood was a significant change, but it came with its benefits, like a better high school and less “ghetto” surroundings. Over time, I adjusted, made new friends, and even some enemies. I got to know a few neighbors well, like Mr. Glen and his family, and Dennis. They’ve become like family to me, and I deeply appreciate their presence.\n\nOne memorable moment was attending Mr. Glen and Ms. Veda's wedding – a joyful event where I caught the wedding bouquet's garter but missed the flowers! We danced and had a great time, especially with their daughter, Marsharii. I haven’t seen her since, but I hope she’s doing well.\n\nThe neighborhood is a bit like a maze, but I have a GPS to guide me through. I’ve explored only a little, mainly with Kason and Curtis. We used to enjoy video games and nature walks, which somehow soothe my soul. I also enjoy practicing my balance with sticks from Home Depot and, if I can, my bokken wooden sword. The basketball and tennis courts are there if I ever want to pick up those sports again. My dad and best friend used to train with Mr. Graves in tennis, and it was always a fun, challenging experience. There are plenty of enjoyable memories here, and I’m sure many more are yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is conveniently close to my college, which is why I appreciate living here. There's mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars nearby that aren't too pricey. One of the bars just changed its name and is a bit pricier, but the service and drinks aren't bad. Most people are friendly, with many being college students or lower income due to affordable housing. A nearby elementary school means there are a lot of kids around. I don't know my neighbors, and that's fine by me. They smoke a lot of weed, which led to the building's management placing an air freshener unit near their door. I think it's funny, but also slightly insulting. The buildings here are usually old but might have nice interiors. Down the street, there are newer apartments, but I think they're cheaply built. Their rent is high, but they're near campus, so management can charge more. There's a cheap restaurant around five minutes away that uses paper plates and microwaves most of its food. Across from it is a gas station I've heard isn't great to work at. The area has improved with road repairs from the city, adding a nice sidewalk, grass, and a nicer look. Behind my apartment complex, there's a tree line and another set of apartments. I live on 42nd Street, and just behind it is 43rd Street, which isn't as nice. The sidewalks are poor quality and buildings look rundown, with many trees to hide their condition. Crime has occurred at apartment complexes on 43rd Street, but I can't blame them alone. Across the street from me, there's also a problematic apartment building with a transient population. Despite this, I like living here. It's affordable, and I have easy access to useful amenities like the university and two bus stops. I can get to the store and downtown with ease.",
            "My neighborhood is a peaceful cul-de-sac filled with yellow duplexes, each with white porches and green metal roofs. We're tucked away from the hustle of the modern world, with fields and trees surrounding us, and blue skies dotted with white clouds. It's a bit like stepping back in time, with almost everyone being friends with each other. On some evenings, we gather at the end of the driveway, chatting as the kids play. Last night, we faced a unique challenge: a tornado warning and actual sirens. I huddled in the bathtub with my little dog and a few pillows, while my bigger dog stayed in the living room, nervous and barking. The neighborhood was eerily quiet, save for the sound of large hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road was steaming from the temperature change, and the hail melted immediately on the hot pavement. A double rainbow appeared, and I snapped pictures to share with friends and family. The streets remained quiet for a while, and then it was back to business as usual. I love this community, especially the southern accents, having moved from NH to NC. I live in a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, as do most of my neighbors. Despite the houses looking alike, the interiors vary. I enjoy walking to the nearby pond, where I've seen deer and heard bullfrogs in the morning. It's a fantastic place to live, just forty minutes from Charlotte. Each morning is greeted by roosters crowing from the nearby farms. There's even a donkey at a nearby farm that lets us know he's there with his evening braying. I consider myself lucky to have found this cozy neighborhood.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just as I was about to start eighth grade. Making friends initially was tough, but I eventually became close with someone who lived two houses down and another guy on my street. They've since moved away, but the memories remain. Most of the original residents are still here, and my neighborhood is typical of any American suburban area. It's filled with two-story houses, and on warm weekends or nice days, you can hear kids playing outside. The neighborhood is usually quiet, and I've never had issues with any neighbors. I trust them, and I've never had any trouble with packages being stolen from my porch. The park a couple of minutes away from my house is where I've spent countless hours. I've played basketball, football, and baseball with the neighborhood kids, and although I have one bad memory from getting elbowed in the nose playing football, the good times outweigh the bad. Now, I often visit the park to spend time with my cousin's kids who enjoy playing on the swings and slides. The park evokes nostalgic feelings, as it's where I made many of my childhood memories. The neighborhood is diverse, with a variety of food options nearby, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants, all accessible via delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash. There's a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store on the same street, along with a diverse range of stores, including an Indian-owned shop. Overall, I'm grateful for my neighborhood as it's a safe and comfortable place to live, unlike some of the horror stories I've seen on news and social media.",
            "My neighborhood, Johnston, is a charming little town nestled in South Carolina. Like many others in the region, it doesn't exactly stand out, but it's a significant player in the agricultural scene. The town is famously known as the Peach Capital of the World, a title proudly displayed on the welcoming sign. The landscape is dominated by vast farmlands, either filled with peach trees or cattle. Houses are scattered, usually two stories high with metal roofs to beat the summer heat or gray shingles for a traditional look. Most homes are tucked back from the road, allowing the front fields to serve as pastures for animals or crops. In the main town area, there's a single stop sign at a four-way intersection where all the stores are located. You can grab \"fast food\" from Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's burger joint. A former pizzeria has since closed down. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a family-owned pharmacy, is famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola. The Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, is the only grocery store, though most residents prefer to shop at a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville. The Dollar General is the busiest store in town, offering a wide range of everyday items. Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman, has been a town staple for years and offers furniture delivery. Attached to the furniture store is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet grooming service offering a variety of pet care services. Both a doctor's practice and a veterinary clinic are located away from the main town area, but they are well-equipped to serve the residents. Johnston Elementary School is the only school in town, with students transferring to the next town for middle and high school. There are no parks, but a 2.5-acre recreational area is being developed. The town is so small that you could breeze through it without noticing, but it's quite cozy nevertheless!",
            "The first time I learned about my place, I caught a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was quite surprising. The rent for almost every apartment nearby was over a grand a month. I'd never heard a whisper about it, and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the harsh reality. I know a few of my buddies are so stressed out they cry themselves to sleep over the costs. Things are expensive, but we've managed to be thrifty over the years. You start to appreciate the nostalgic smell of flea market toys and second-hand clothes. You smell less in adulthood. You might pick up the habit of smoking, or you might just be used to the state of things. But the flea market always finds its way in. The scent of adulthood lingers in the dusty magazines on a closed piano and clings to the leather, even after washing. Here, within walking distance, there are three thrift stores. If you start from the edge, you can pop into two charity shops, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling, cars and people fill the streets daily, but you'll never hear it inside the thrifts. Not a soul nor a sound from the outside world can penetrate the silent stores. It's a great place to lose an afternoon. Each year, the city grows denser with people and cars. They claim it's a developing city, with an online empire headquartered here for e-commerce and delivery. It's still showing signs of growth pains, much like New York. Everyone's focused on their own goals, and they don't ask much from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a bit concerned means you genuinely care. You don't pry into anyone's life here. You can keep your shell as long as you want, and the city will just roll along like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to call home. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always some sort of music or action. We're not just a bunch of strangers in an apartment building; we're a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate life's milestones, and help each other when possible. In a way, I feel lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I make sure to tidy up after myself and leave them some food, and they do the same for me. We share mail, and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl, but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't make a mistake in choosing to live here.",
            "My neighborhood is your typical cookie cutter suburbia, but with a unique twist. The homeowner's association is very strict here, which means every house is well-maintained and uniform. There are no individual mailboxes; instead, there's a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street, and two larger lockers for packages. The houses are mostly single-story, but you'll find a mix of both. The neighborhood is located on the edge of a nearby city, making it partially rural and partially suburban. There's plenty of land, including community pools and walking trails, so you can get your exercise right in your neighborhood. It's mainly inhabited by retired folks and a small mix of middle-aged and young professionals. The city itself is surprisingly large in population but retains a small-town feel. There's a single mall for shopping, and it's a 15-minute drive to get there. It offers everything from high-end grocery stores to bargain outlets. Overall, it's a safe, well-maintained neighborhood with a lot of nice amenities like pools and walking trails. Although we're not right next door to major shopping, you can easily hop in a car and get to any major chain you'd like.",
            "I reside in a small Midwestern town situated just on the outskirts of a major city's suburban areas. My immediate neighborhood, located on the east side of town, is recognized as the most economically disadvantaged part of the town. Property values are generally lower, with most houses being either rented to or owned by individuals with lower incomes. Despite this, the area is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are typically friendly and will often greet me with a smile as I walk down the street. While crime rates are slightly higher compared to other parts of town, they are still low. Over the past decade, there have been a few violent incidents, including shootings and a homicide, within a few blocks of my home. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a nearby bar last year. Thankfully, our family has not been directly impacted by crime beyond the occasional item disappearing from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. The town I live in has been significantly affected by the ongoing \"opioid epidemic\" that has impacted many parts of the United States. Unfortunately, many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are numerous resources available in our town to combat this issue, including addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, the town has many positive aspects. My son's elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. My son, despite having special needs, has not faced any bullying due to the school's incredibly positive atmosphere and loves it there. We have an active PTO that organizes multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town's population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring that no child ever goes hungry. No child or family is treated as \"less than\" due to their inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Most of these improvements have been concentrated in the town center and on the west side, where all the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side, where I live, often feels neglected, which is a point of contention for my neighbors. Overall, I enjoy living in this town. The people are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options to meet my family's needs, and while our home may not be worth much, it is comfortable and adequate. We have lived here for over 16 years and cannot envision living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is rich in culture. It's situated on a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical significance. I reside in a 7-story apartment building right across from the old live Theatre, and a block down from The Hill is a quaint arcade bar that draws diverse crowds on warm summer nights. On weekends in June and July, you often see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park, quite large for its location. Surrounding the park is concrete, with tall steps poured into the wall. During winter, homeless people set up their tents in neat rows, using the central location to stay warmer despite the lack of snow and the cold rain. They're also close to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city, though, isn't the historic buildings or the architecture scattered across the rolling hills leading to the ocean. What I love is the culture of the people themselves. Hilltop was once notorious for gang violence, and even today, stories about the federal government and DEA efforts to clean the streets are passed down from generation to generation. Despite it being considered one of the roughest neighborhoods, the people here work hard to keep it clean. They still care about what happens in their city and on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark, a warning that feels like a remnant of the past, tainted by social conditioning. Maybe it's that I'm dark enough to pass as less white, or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who understands the reminders of racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions made out of ignorance and fear. No matter where I go, Hilltop feels like home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have offered me a jacket or a kind word more than they would rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners stay open a few extra minutes for me to charge my phone when I have nowhere else to escape the rain. It's a place where I've sat, feeling invisible, huddled against concrete storefronts on the greyest nights, only to have someone stop, look me in the eye, and hand me $5, telling me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I hail from rural America, nestled within the small, picturesque town of Michigan. My locale is a delightful blend of farmland and tourist havens, with no big city malls, Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s in sight. You've got to drive to get anywhere, but the beauty is unparalleled. Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix flank the town, offering a serene coastline and inviting beaches. My neighborhood embodies the quintessential small-town vibe. Houses aren't stacked or cookie-cutter; they're older, with some having been updated, and many sporting full basements visible from the road. Aluminum siding and a rainbow of colors adorn the homes, each with yards featuring trampolines, play areas, gardens, and fences for pets. Middle America is epitomized here, with hardworking families raising or having raised their kids. Kids darting up and down the streets, and neighbors walking dogs, biking, and rollerblading are common sights. You recognize who fits in and who doesn't. Neighbors wave and smile, with lawns well-maintained and free of fall leaves. Our town is not flashy but safe and inviting, representing what people seek in life—a peaceful haven. The county sheriff’s department and jail are nearby, along with the health department, city recycling center, baseball and softball fields, and a small airport. You can hear planes taking off and landing while enjoying ice cream from the local shop or riding bikes to the park. My kids can even ride their bikes downtown. It's truly a great place to call home."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

But if you venture behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk past the hotels that only come to life during family reunions or summers, you'll discover an entire thriving community.

Children play and cartwheel in the grass, while bees lazily buzz around the flower beds by the road. Retired folks stroll their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenage skateboarders and nodding to the girls clustered by the playground, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube trends. A sushi place in the strip mall beside the park offers affordable meals but is never too bustling - a swimming supply store lies next door, and a nail salon is tucked in between. You could fill your pool, get a manicure, and enjoy hibachi chicken all at once - the convenience of a strip mall. A frozen yogurt shop also resides there, where teens often grab DIY frozen yogurt cups with toppings while performing tricks on their skateboards and enjoying vapes. The neighborhood is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the languid south where change is rare, and even time seems to move slowly.",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we cruised past the endless corn fields stretching out before us. “This is it!” I declared, knowing she'd be blown away by the vastness of the open countryside. She hailed from a bustling town where the grocery store was just five minutes' walk from her doorstep—she'd never seen so much empty space in her life. Taken aback by the omnipresence of corn fields, I shared with her what growing up in rural Ohio was like, and in that instant, she finally understood where I came from. Driving down a winding two-lane country road, you'll eventually reach a quarry brimming with water. Just past that you'll find the small development where I reside. The houses are mostly made of brick and stucco, each with at least a half-acre of land, which everyone takes great pride in maintaining. Springtime brings an abundance of annually planted flowers and the vibrant colors of midwestern trees that change with every season. Driveways are filled with gleaming Mercedes-Benz luxury cars after a good car wash. Continuing down the road towards my grey stucco home, I have a Korean neighbor who's always out and about. He spends his days mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over the hum of his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Everyone finds him amusing, but he's genuinely nice and has a remarkable past as a doctor. These days, he blends with the lawn and his mower, losing some of his wit with age. Finally, you'll reach my home. In the side yard, geese are aplenty and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, a small stream feeds into the quarry. Here, you'll hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with wild-growing trees, herbs, and flowers. This was my childhood playground. We built tree forts, played pretend, and chased animals—well, mostly chased each other. The winters in my small town can be mercilessly cold, yet there's nothing more enchanting. The yard transforms from a lush green expanse into a wintry wonderland. The vibrant fall foliage turns into stark, bare branches and the occasional snowfall creates a magical winter wonderland. The backyard is filled with snow angels and snowmen my sister and I made. We fought like siblings, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapons of choice. We'd build massive igloo-like forts to house our arsenal, using branches as makeshift weapons. Our little winter wonderland was where our imaginations ran wild and nothing else mattered. We were just young kids, carefree and innocent.",
            "The first thing you should know about Portland, Oregon is that it's definitely \"weird\". The tongue-in-cheek town motto, plastered on the back of a building that doubles as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, and a place that flirts with the law on most of its enterprises, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, this is a reminder of the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less well-known and less pricey, fostering creative and unique subcultures. For others, it's an invitation - come to Portland, where being weird is seen as a badge of honor. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the non-stop construction of condos, Portland remains weird. Being weird isn't about accepting everything, but it is about accepting the unusual. It doesn't mean we lack modern conveniences or face the same issues as the rest of the country. Like everyone else, we buy a lot from China. Weirdness comes in countless forms, and Portland has plenty of \"normal\" too - yoga, hipsters, business professionals. Perhaps weirdness is just a matter of taking it all less seriously. In my neighborhood, and many other Portland neighborhoods, you'll find colorful houses, gardens with flowers, herbs, and vegetables, and free boxes in the summer. These free boxes are usually cardboard containing items someone's getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They hold magical treasures, perfect for the passerby, often enough. Free boxes often contain clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of wandering through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about - to me, at least, but I'm just one of the many different weirdos here. Some people I live among would never dream of picking clothes from a sidewalk box. They'd rather go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is filled with people who love all sorts of things. Many dream about pursuing their dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug issues are often rooted in mental health struggles, and the constant rain and dreary clouds can exacerbate this. Portland also has a homelessness problem, which no one seems to know how to fix. Our social services are better than in many places, but they're still not enough. The local population swings between care and resentment. In this, Portland is not weird at all.",
            "The mountains have always been there, looming over the north, constantly witnessing the sun's daily journey. Even when I'm caught up in work or life, they stand firm, unyielding and unaffected by life's challenges. On days when stress and worry overwhelm me, they call out to me, offering solace and strength when I turn to them. I first noticed them when I moved here for my undergrad, and they've been captivating me ever since. While the university and town have their own charms, it's the mountains that hold a special place in my heart. The town, with its blend of urban and suburban life, offers a unique atmosphere. There are countless cafes where I've spent many hours studying, and the downtown area, with its vintage brick buildings, has a bustling energy that's almost magical. Just beyond the library, you can find a serene, small-town vibe. This mix of environments creates a wonderful cityscape, beckoning exploration. Each part of town holds cherished memories for me - from late-night walks with friends to catching movies in a fancy theater. But it also holds harsh memories, as all places do. The ponds, especially, have been a place for deep reflection and late-night existential crises. Watching the pond creatures live their lives has made me ponder my own purpose in life. I've walked past the park and houses, until I reached the main street. There, the sun painted the sky with its brilliant rays, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was heading north. And there they were, as always - the strong, imposing mountains painting the sky, giving me the strength to carry on, one day at a time.",
            "If you're thinking of dropping by Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, don't worry, it's super accessible! Public transport is a breeze, which is a big plus in NYC. Bensonhurt is a bit of an urban jungle, so you'll still feel like you're in the city. Be ready to spot plenty of Asian stores around. Over the past couple of decades, Bensonhurt has seen a surge of Asian residents, which means you'll find at least one Asian-owned business every block. Supermarkets and laundromats are the most common, and locals love them because the food quality is top-notch, prices are cheap, and they're super convenient. I've got four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of my place! Not that Bensonhurt is all Asian, though; it's incredibly diverse. Most big local businesses are Asian-owned, but there's also a newly renovated park nearby with plenty of courts for all sorts of sports, playgrounds, and a water fountain. NYC parks are always diverse and welcoming. There aren't many big corporate buildings; mostly you'll find co-op living or condo apartments, with the majority of homes being two-family houses. Most people are friendly, but it can get noisy, with cars blasting music and people revving their engines all the time. Be cautious at night; the neighborhood is generally safe, but people can be unpredictable, and you might encounter bullies and thieves. I've had my share of trouble here, like being physically assaulted years ago and having packages stolen. Package theft is common, and there's also a lot of dog waste around. It's my biggest pet peeve! Just be careful and keep your shoes clean!",
            "Where I live, sidewalks are a scarcity. The streets slope downwards, and my home sits at the highest point of the steepest hill in the neighborhood, earning it the nickname \"workout hill\" for the joggers who pound the pavement daily. With no sidewalks on my street, everyone walks in the road. The surfaces are rough in places, making it a bit treacherous to drive on. The telecommunication and electric lines overhead are a tattered mess, constantly being repaired due to regular rain and storms. Trees, especially evergreens, are everywhere, but locals detest them for obstructing the ocean view. Houses are built high up on the hill, with expansive glass-fronted second stories lining the crest, all vying for a glimpse of the bay. Sunsets are breathtaking when the water is illuminated from below and the sky turns orange, but clouds often obscure the view, and moss grows on everything, even my car. Kids are rare, and dogs and rabbits are more common. There are no stores nearby, but a short hike down to the waterfront leads to a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. The bay is not wide, but the rocks along the shore are fun to toss into the water, and you can see the opposite shore on clear days.",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area of a small southern town in Tennessee, nestled between two state highways which brings a bit more traffic than I'd ideally prefer. However, aside from that, it’s a quiet locale. Not many folks move in or out, so I've become accustomed to the folks who live in the neighborhood. Most people keep busy with yard work and daily chores, while others enjoy walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids zip around on their bikes as you'd expect. My family and I are often at home since we work from our house; my wife and I, along with our daughters, ages eleven and fourteen, are a familiar sight to the neighborhood. We engage in outdoor activities, even in the rain, and occasionally we grill outside on our back deck, filling the air with the pleasant aroma of barbecue. Lawn mowers are a common sound from March through October, as neighbors keep their grass trimmed. The neighborhood is shaded by trees, which were originally part of a wooded area, but that also means dealing with leaves in the fall, which we rake and burn annually. I find the smell of burning leaves a comforting sign that fall has arrived. Lately, we've had little winter, making it seem like a prolonged fall. Our garage is at the back, so we don't use the front door much unless someone knocks, which is rare. I enjoy working in the garage on my truck or other projects, as it makes me feel more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays are quite quiet here, but during Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, and Christmas, you’ll see extra cars parked as neighbors visit with out-of-town family. Overall, I enjoy living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is smack dab in the high desert, where dirt is the reigning color. Unless you've been here, you might not understand the feeling of constant brown. When you do see a lawn, you know that person is investing a fortune in its upkeep. Back in the 90s, houses were scattered far and wide. Now, the layout is similar, but new additions are popping up. Truth is, this place is starting to look more and more like a city, and I suppose that's how it goes everywhere. Most people here are friendly, but just like any city, there are good areas and not-so-good ones. In my neighborhood, I'm surrounded by friendly old folks—it's quite nice. The stores here are mostly chain places like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you're looking for upscale, you'll have to travel. I don't often see stores like Whole Foods around here.\n\nMost prominent jobs in my city, based on my observations, are in construction. I think it's because this place is still developing, with a lot of room for building. That bothers me a bit; I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and don't want to go back. Speaking of construction, that's what my full-time job is about—drywall and T-bar installation.\n\nWhat I love about my home is the variety of animals. People come here for the desert's stark beauty, and the climate and topography create unique ecosystems that need protection and are home to diverse wildlife. My family and I have gotten used to the wildlife. My three kids are obsessed with lizards and desert bugs; they're outside now trying to catch some specimens.\n\nAs for attractions, Victorville offers some unique experiences. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with the San Bernardino County Fair. It's a great time to experience Victorville's way of life. You could also head to nearby Wrightwood to see snow-covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons. If you're interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert, the Victor Valley Museum is a must-visit. It houses geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of Victorville's development.",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'd say it's a bit different from the typical image most people have. Instead of your traditional residential area with homeowners leading their individual lives, my neighborhood is the college campus where I live. The people who live in my dormitory make up my community, and the surrounding campus also contributes to this feeling of neighborhood, though to a lesser degree. Despite this uniqueness, my neighborhood shares some standard features with other neighborhoods. It, too, includes houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's start by talking about the \"houses\" in my neighborhood. To understand my neighborhood's housing, it's important to know the types of houses that populate it. There are three main types of housing: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory houses. In the apartments, each room usually houses 2-4 people, with about 4-6 rooms on each floor. A building can hold around 20 people on average. Actual houses are scattered throughout the neighborhood and are typically rented by school affiliates, usually alumni. These houses are usually 2-4 bedrooms. Dormitory houses are by far the most common, accommodating hundreds of students. In these, you'll find two people sharing a room, with the exception of a few. Now, let's move on to the people. My college prides itself on diversity, and this is evident in the makeup of my neighborhood. The diverse cultures and ages that live here are one of the things that make it special. Professional staff members tend to live in the houses available for rent, while newer students stay in dormitory-style housing, and older students live in apartments. To talk about the people in my neighborhood would take too long, so let's move on to the stores and parks. Since my school is self-contained, it offers a variety of stores, including dining options and the school's unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. This means that everything needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries. Additionally, my neighborhood has a park that serves as a playground for all the diverse people who live here. This park is kept clean and safe by everyone in the community!",
            "Well, having spent a decade here, I can share some of my experiences. When I first arrived in this neighborhood, I was quite down because I was leaving behind the familiarity of Riverdale for Stockbridge. I cried, as much as I loved my old home and friends, but my parents wanted a better environment for us. The move to a more upmarket neighborhood was a significant change, but it came with its benefits, like a better high school and less “ghetto” surroundings. Over time, I adjusted, made new friends, and even some enemies. I got to know a few neighbors well, like Mr. Glen and his family, and Dennis. They’ve become like family to me, and I deeply appreciate their presence.\n\nOne memorable moment was attending Mr. Glen and Ms. Veda's wedding – a joyful event where I caught the wedding bouquet's garter but missed the flowers! We danced and had a great time, especially with their daughter, Marsharii. I haven’t seen her since, but I hope she’s doing well.\n\nThe neighborhood is a bit like a maze, but I have a GPS to guide me through. I’ve explored only a little, mainly with Kason and Curtis. We used to enjoy video games and nature walks, which somehow soothe my soul. I also enjoy practicing my balance with sticks from Home Depot and, if I can, my bokken wooden sword. The basketball and tennis courts are there if I ever want to pick up those sports again. My dad and best friend used to train with Mr. Graves in tennis, and it was always a fun, challenging experience. There are plenty of enjoyable memories here, and I’m sure many more are yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is conveniently close to my college, which is why I appreciate living here. There's mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars nearby that aren't too pricey. One of the bars just changed its name and is a bit pricier, but the service and drinks aren't bad. Most people are friendly, with many being college students or lower income due to affordable housing. A nearby elementary school means there are a lot of kids around. I don't know my neighbors, and that's fine by me. They smoke a lot of weed, which led to the building's management placing an air freshener unit near their door. I think it's funny, but also slightly insulting. The buildings here are usually old but might have nice interiors. Down the street, there are newer apartments, but I think they're cheaply built. Their rent is high, but they're near campus, so management can charge more. There's a cheap restaurant around five minutes away that uses paper plates and microwaves most of its food. Across from it is a gas station I've heard isn't great to work at. The area has improved with road repairs from the city, adding a nice sidewalk, grass, and a nicer look. Behind my apartment complex, there's a tree line and another set of apartments. I live on 42nd Street, and just behind it is 43rd Street, which isn't as nice. The sidewalks are poor quality and buildings look rundown, with many trees to hide their condition. Crime has occurred at apartment complexes on 43rd Street, but I can't blame them alone. Across the street from me, there's also a problematic apartment building with a transient population. Despite this, I like living here. It's affordable, and I have easy access to useful amenities like the university and two bus stops. I can get to the store and downtown with ease.",
            "My neighborhood is a peaceful cul-de-sac filled with yellow duplexes, each with white porches and green metal roofs. We're tucked away from the hustle of the modern world, with fields and trees surrounding us, and blue skies dotted with white clouds. It's a bit like stepping back in time, with almost everyone being friends with each other. On some evenings, we gather at the end of the driveway, chatting as the kids play. Last night, we faced a unique challenge: a tornado warning and actual sirens. I huddled in the bathtub with my little dog and a few pillows, while my bigger dog stayed in the living room, nervous and barking. The neighborhood was eerily quiet, save for the sound of large hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road was steaming from the temperature change, and the hail melted immediately on the hot pavement. A double rainbow appeared, and I snapped pictures to share with friends and family. The streets remained quiet for a while, and then it was back to business as usual. I love this community, especially the southern accents, having moved from NH to NC. I live in a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, as do most of my neighbors. Despite the houses looking alike, the interiors vary. I enjoy walking to the nearby pond, where I've seen deer and heard bullfrogs in the morning. It's a fantastic place to live, just forty minutes from Charlotte. Each morning is greeted by roosters crowing from the nearby farms. There's even a donkey at a nearby farm that lets us know he's there with his evening braying. I consider myself lucky to have found this cozy neighborhood.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just as I was about to start eighth grade. Making friends initially was tough, but I eventually became close with someone who lived two houses down and another guy on my street. They've since moved away, but the memories remain. Most of the original residents are still here, and my neighborhood is typical of any American suburban area. It's filled with two-story houses, and on warm weekends or nice days, you can hear kids playing outside. The neighborhood is usually quiet, and I've never had issues with any neighbors. I trust them, and I've never had any trouble with packages being stolen from my porch. The park a couple of minutes away from my house is where I've spent countless hours. I've played basketball, football, and baseball with the neighborhood kids, and although I have one bad memory from getting elbowed in the nose playing football, the good times outweigh the bad. Now, I often visit the park to spend time with my cousin's kids who enjoy playing on the swings and slides. The park evokes nostalgic feelings, as it's where I made many of my childhood memories. The neighborhood is diverse, with a variety of food options nearby, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants, all accessible via delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash. There's a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store on the same street, along with a diverse range of stores, including an Indian-owned shop. Overall, I'm grateful for my neighborhood as it's a safe and comfortable place to live, unlike some of the horror stories I've seen on news and social media.",
            "My neighborhood, Johnston, is a charming little town nestled in South Carolina. Like many others in the region, it doesn't exactly stand out, but it's a significant player in the agricultural scene. The town is famously known as the Peach Capital of the World, a title proudly displayed on the welcoming sign. The landscape is dominated by vast farmlands, either filled with peach trees or cattle. Houses are scattered, usually two stories high with metal roofs to beat the summer heat or gray shingles for a traditional look. Most homes are tucked back from the road, allowing the front fields to serve as pastures for animals or crops. In the main town area, there's a single stop sign at a four-way intersection where all the stores are located. You can grab \"fast food\" from Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's burger joint. A former pizzeria has since closed down. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a family-owned pharmacy, is famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola. The Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, is the only grocery store, though most residents prefer to shop at a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville. The Dollar General is the busiest store in town, offering a wide range of everyday items. Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman, has been a town staple for years and offers furniture delivery. Attached to the furniture store is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet grooming service offering a variety of pet care services. Both a doctor's practice and a veterinary clinic are located away from the main town area, but they are well-equipped to serve the residents. Johnston Elementary School is the only school in town, with students transferring to the next town for middle and high school. There are no parks, but a 2.5-acre recreational area is being developed. The town is so small that you could breeze through it without noticing, but it's quite cozy nevertheless!",
            "The first time I learned about my place, I caught a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was quite surprising. The rent for almost every apartment nearby was over a grand a month. I'd never heard a whisper about it, and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the harsh reality. I know a few of my buddies are so stressed out they cry themselves to sleep over the costs. Things are expensive, but we've managed to be thrifty over the years. You start to appreciate the nostalgic smell of flea market toys and second-hand clothes. You smell less in adulthood. You might pick up the habit of smoking, or you might just be used to the state of things. But the flea market always finds its way in. The scent of adulthood lingers in the dusty magazines on a closed piano and clings to the leather, even after washing. Here, within walking distance, there are three thrift stores. If you start from the edge, you can pop into two charity shops, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling, cars and people fill the streets daily, but you'll never hear it inside the thrifts. Not a soul nor a sound from the outside world can penetrate the silent stores. It's a great place to lose an afternoon. Each year, the city grows denser with people and cars. They claim it's a developing city, with an online empire headquartered here for e-commerce and delivery. It's still showing signs of growth pains, much like New York. Everyone's focused on their own goals, and they don't ask much from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a bit concerned means you genuinely care. You don't pry into anyone's life here. You can keep your shell as long as you want, and the city will just roll along like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to call home. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always some sort of music or action. We're not just a bunch of strangers in an apartment building; we're a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate life's milestones, and help each other when possible. In a way, I feel lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I make sure to tidy up after myself and leave them some food, and they do the same for me. We share mail, and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl, but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't make a mistake in choosing to live here.",
            "My neighborhood is your typical cookie cutter suburbia, but with a unique twist. The homeowner's association is very strict here, which means every house is well-maintained and uniform. There are no individual mailboxes; instead, there's a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street, and two larger lockers for packages. The houses are mostly single-story, but you'll find a mix of both. The neighborhood is located on the edge of a nearby city, making it partially rural and partially suburban. There's plenty of land, including community pools and walking trails, so you can get your exercise right in your neighborhood. It's mainly inhabited by retired folks and a small mix of middle-aged and young professionals. The city itself is surprisingly large in population but retains a small-town feel. There's a single mall for shopping, and it's a 15-minute drive to get there. It offers everything from high-end grocery stores to bargain outlets. Overall, it's a safe, well-maintained neighborhood with a lot of nice amenities like pools and walking trails. Although we're not right next door to major shopping, you can easily hop in a car and get to any major chain you'd like.",
            "I reside in a small Midwestern town situated just on the outskirts of a major city's suburban areas. My immediate neighborhood, located on the east side of town, is recognized as the most economically disadvantaged part of the town. Property values are generally lower, with most houses being either rented to or owned by individuals with lower incomes. Despite this, the area is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are typically friendly and will often greet me with a smile as I walk down the street. While crime rates are slightly higher compared to other parts of town, they are still low. Over the past decade, there have been a few violent incidents, including shootings and a homicide, within a few blocks of my home. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a nearby bar last year. Thankfully, our family has not been directly impacted by crime beyond the occasional item disappearing from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. The town I live in has been significantly affected by the ongoing \"opioid epidemic\" that has impacted many parts of the United States. Unfortunately, many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are numerous resources available in our town to combat this issue, including addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, the town has many positive aspects. My son's elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. My son, despite having special needs, has not faced any bullying due to the school's incredibly positive atmosphere and loves it there. We have an active PTO that organizes multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town's population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring that no child ever goes hungry. No child or family is treated as \"less than\" due to their inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Most of these improvements have been concentrated in the town center and on the west side, where all the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side, where I live, often feels neglected, which is a point of contention for my neighbors. Overall, I enjoy living in this town. The people are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options to meet my family's needs, and while our home may not be worth much, it is comfortable and adequate. We have lived here for over 16 years and cannot envision living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is rich in culture. It's situated on a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical significance. I reside in a 7-story apartment building right across from the old live Theatre, and a block down from The Hill is a quaint arcade bar that draws diverse crowds on warm summer nights. On weekends in June and July, you often see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park, quite large for its location. Surrounding the park is concrete, with tall steps poured into the wall. During winter, homeless people set up their tents in neat rows, using the central location to stay warmer despite the lack of snow and the cold rain. They're also close to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city, though, isn't the historic buildings or the architecture scattered across the rolling hills leading to the ocean. What I love is the culture of the people themselves. Hilltop was once notorious for gang violence, and even today, stories about the federal government and DEA efforts to clean the streets are passed down from generation to generation. Despite it being considered one of the roughest neighborhoods, the people here work hard to keep it clean. They still care about what happens in their city and on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark, a warning that feels like a remnant of the past, tainted by social conditioning. Maybe it's that I'm dark enough to pass as less white, or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who understands the reminders of racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions made out of ignorance and fear. No matter where I go, Hilltop feels like home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have offered me a jacket or a kind word more than they would rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners stay open a few extra minutes for me to charge my phone when I have nowhere else to escape the rain. It's a place where I've sat, feeling invisible, huddled against concrete storefronts on the greyest nights, only to have someone stop, look me in the eye, and hand me $5, telling me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I hail from rural America, nestled within the small, picturesque town of Michigan. My locale is a delightful blend of farmland and tourist havens, with no big city malls, Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s in sight. You've got to drive to get anywhere, but the beauty is unparalleled. Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix flank the town, offering a serene coastline and inviting beaches. My neighborhood embodies the quintessential small-town vibe. Houses aren't stacked or cookie-cutter; they're older, with some having been updated, and many sporting full basements visible from the road. Aluminum siding and a rainbow of colors adorn the homes, each with yards featuring trampolines, play areas, gardens, and fences for pets. Middle America is epitomized here, with hardworking families raising or having raised their kids. Kids darting up and down the streets, and neighbors walking dogs, biking, and rollerblading are common sights. You recognize who fits in and who doesn't. Neighbors wave and smile, with lawns well-maintained and free of fall leaves. Our town is not flashy but safe and inviting, representing what people seek in life—a peaceful haven. The county sheriff’s department and jail are nearby, along with the health department, city recycling center, baseball and softball fields, and a small airport. You can hear planes taking off and landing while enjoying ice cream from the local shop or riding bikes to the park. My kids can even ride their bikes downtown. It's truly a great place to call home."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "Living in a major city, my neighborhood is incredibly diverse. Residential areas are scattered amongst commercial zones featuring an array of businesses from offices to stores, restaurants, and entertainment spots. There's no shortage of eateries or shops to explore, with both large corporate chains and trendy boutiques lining the streets. Some stores are located in malls, while others are in walking distance from residential areas that might otherwise be peaceful. A couple of nearby parks attract families with young children. The neighborhood itself is a melting pot of cultures. In one area, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a mix of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Just outside the neighborhood, there are numerous ethnic enclaves like Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia, which are only a few miles away. However, navigating ten miles can sometimes take two hours due to traffic, especially during peak hours. Few people walk anywhere in the city, preferring to drive. Recent years have seen substantial construction, with new apartment buildings being added, which while attractive, has led to increased traffic and parking difficulties. My city offers a variety of housing options—single-family homes, duplexes, and smaller apartment buildings are all common. The neighborhood is diverse in age, and while I remember childhood memories of playing with neighbors, I don't know most of my current neighbors. It's not like the close-knit communities of the past.",
            "My neighborhood is a unique blend of old and new, much like the houses themselves. Most are single-family homes, but there are a few that have been divided into two, still attached to each other. My home has a small front yard and a driveway, just like many others, echoing a simpler time when the American dream was at its peak. But the dream seems to be fading, as the optimism of the past is gone. The yards are not as well-maintained as they once were, but there's still a car or two in every driveway, and children play as if the world revolves around them. The public school, standing tall for nearly nine decades, still influences the younger generation while evoking nostalgia in the elders. The churches are few and far between, usually empty, but the basketball courts are always bustling with activity. Each home has its own character, yet there's a familiar feel to them all.\n\nSuper \"A,\" owned by a large Yemeni family, is the community's main supermarket. Despite the lack of other Arab families, the vast majority of residents are African American. The streets are wide, and kids play football, pausing only to let cars pass. Many have lived here for generations, and they can share tales of a past where everyone knew everyone's name. The former karate school is now a pharmacy, a testament to the changing interests of the kids. The old movie theater plays classic films at discounted prices, attracting the elders but not the younger crowd. An expressway runs through our town, its exit and entrance in the neighboring town. There was a time when we tried to get an exit for our town, but the elders' concerns about ruining the town's essence swayed the city council. Now, a new high school is being built, and we're deciding on a mascot. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the perfect representation of our town.",
            "You might overlook it at first glance - after all, it's a residential area tucked behind a shopping strip, not where you'd initially expect to find places to live. Most people wouldn't consider it a place they'd want to live, but if you venture behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk through the hotels that are only occupied annually, you'll stumble upon a thriving community. Nestled within these streets are several apartment complexes, lining up like Russian nesting dolls that have been carefully dismantled and placed side by side. The first set of apartments you'll see have been in the news for some unsavory incidents, so we won't dwell on those. But the apartments next to them, and the two complexes beside those, are like another world, unknown to most locals. Across the road stands a community college satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings where students with coffee cups meander in, yawning at 7 am to begin their lazy mornings. The iron gates creak open to let them in one by one, as commuters shake their fists out the window and complain about the traffic on days when attendance is higher. The road branches out into another residential street, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people with broken bones on the other. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture and a slowly spinning ceiling fan to circulate the warm, thick summer air. Children zoom around the park on the other side, somersaulting and spinning like pinwheels across the prickly green grass while bees lazily float in the flower patches nearby. Elderly residents walk their dogs on the walking path, giving disapproving looks at teenagers on skateboards and nodding politely at the teenage girls huddled by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. A sushi place in a strip mall beside the park offers cheap food but isn't often busy - right next to it is a swimming supply store and a nail salon squeezed in between. You can fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and enjoying hibachi chicken all at once - the convenience of a strip mall. There's a DIY frozen yogurt shop too, and you often see teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt topped with various toppings while they perform skateboard tricks and vape, believing it to be the coolest thing. This neighborhood is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the quiet south where time seems to stand still.",
            "“Where is everything?” she exclaimed as we cruised past the endless corn fields stretching out before us. “This is it!” I declared, knowing she'd be taken aback by the vast openness of the landscape. She hailed from a town where the grocery store was just a short walk from her home—she'd never seen such expansive emptiness. Stunned by the omnipresence of corn, I shared with her what it was like growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood where I came from. Driving down a country two-lane road, you'll reach a quarry filled with water. Just beyond it lies the small development where I reside.

Heading towards my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always out mowing his lawn with a friendly face. He tends to spend the whole day humming a tune while he mows, which everyone finds amusing. Despite his age and a slight loss of wit, he was once a doctor and blends in perfectly with his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Finally, you'll reach my home. In the side yard, geese wander freely while our Terrier chases them. Out back, a small stream feeds into the quarry, where you can hear bullfrogs, the water flowing, and the occasional “moo” from nearby farms. Across a handmade wooden bridge lies an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers.

In this little wonderland, we played pretend, lost in a world without a care.",
            "Portland, Oregon is a place defined by \"weirdness,\" with the unofficial town motto being \"Keep Portland Weird.\" For some, this is a nod to the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and more affordable, fostering creative and unique subcultures. For others, it's an invitation to embrace the weird, as Portland accepts what is often not accepted elsewhere. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and new condominiums, Portland remains weird. Weirdness isn't always acceptance, but it does embrace the unconventional. Portland has its modern conveniences and battles, like the rest of the country, importing most of its goods from China. There are countless ways to be weird, but Portland has plenty of normal too—yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Weirdness might mean we take all this less seriously. In my neighborhood, like many in Portland, we have colorful houses, home gardens, and free boxes in the summer, containing treasures for the unsuspecting passerby. Free boxes often include clothes and books, sometimes even plastic bags, and the magic of walking through Southeast Portland's neighborhoods is what Portland is all about. To me, it's about the variety of weirdness I encounter, but I'm just one among many. Some neighbors wouldn't dream of picking clothes from the sidewalk. They prefer goat yoga or Timbers matches. Portland is full of dreamers and dream-chasers, sometimes spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem, often due to mental health issues exacerbated by the constant rain and dreary weather. Homelessness is a significant issue, drawing many by better social services but insufficiently addressed. The non-homeless population oscillates between care and disdain, with Portland mirroring the country's general response to this problem. In this, Portland is not weird at all.",
            "The mountains are always present, bearing witness to the sun’s daily rise and set in the north. No matter how distracted by work and life I become, they stand firm, unshaken by life's challenges. On days when stress and worry overwhelm me, they demand my attention, and when I turn to them, they offer solace, lending me strength to continue. I first moved here for my undergrad, and the mountains north of campus were what initially captivated me. While the university boasts its own stunning landscapes in buildings, ponds, and trees, it's the mountains that truly hold my heart. The rest of the town is charming, with numerous cafés hosting countless hours of study sessions fueled by caffeine. A short walk or bus ride brings you to the downtown area, where faded brick buildings and historic restaurants create an atmosphere of bustle and vigor, just like its urban neighbor. This blend of city and town vibes makes the city feel like a place begging to be explored. This duality of atmospheres in such close proximity adds a magical touch, creating unforgettable memories associated with different parts of town. Whether it's walking past the old park swings with friends after an all-nighter or dashing through the busy downtown to catch a movie in the fancy theater with university tickets, the city offers a variety of experiences. However, it also holds harsh memories, as all places in life are bound to have them. The ponds, in particular, serve as a perfect spot for reflection and even crying sessions in the middle of the night during existential crises. While watching the turtles, ducks, and insects live out their lives, each with their role, I often pondered my own purpose as I navigated life's mysteries. I walked past the pond, park, and suburban houses until I reached a main street. There, the sun shone its warm rays above the palm trees, painting the sky, and as I looked up, I realized I was heading north. Sure enough, they were there, as they always had been. The towering mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky, and without words, they stirred my sense of perseverance.",
            "If you're heading to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, it's no sweat to find - public transportation is super convenient and it's one of NYC's top modes of transit. Bensonhurst is quite urban, so you'll feel right at home in the city. Get ready to see a ton of Asian stores when you visit. Over the past couple of decades, Bensonhurst has welcomed a lot of Asian residents, so you'll find Asian-owned shops on practically every block. Supermarkets and laundromats are the most common, and they're a hit with locals due to their top-notch food, cheaper prices, and convenience. There are at least four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk of each other near me, which makes grocery shopping a breeze. I wouldn't say Bensonhurst is Asian-only, though; it's pretty diverse, with immigrants and their children living there. Most of the big businesses are Asian-owned, and there's also a newly renovated park nearby with a bunch of sports facilities, a playground, and even a water fountain. Since we're in NYC, the park's pretty diverse, with people from all walks of life getting along. There aren't many big corporate buildings here; most are co-ops or condos. Most homes are two-family houses, and most people are friendly, but it can be noisy too. Every day, you'll hear cars blasting music and revving engines. At night, be cautious - while it's generally safe, people can be unpredictable and there's been some petty crime like theft and bullying. I've experienced this myself, but it was a while ago. There's also a bit of a dog waste issue - NYC has fines for not cleaning up, but people don't always follow the rules, so you'll see dog poop on the streets every morning. My biggest beef is stepping on dog waste everywhere. Watch your step and keep your shoes clean!",
            "Where I reside, sidewalks are scarce, and the terrain slopes sharply, with my house perched at the peak of the neighborhood's steepest hill, earning it the moniker \"workout hill\" among joggers. The street is just a road, riddled with potholes and hazardous to drive on, with tangled, weathered electrical and telephone wires crisscrossing overhead. Given our region's rainy and stormy climate, power lines are frequently damaged by falling debris, leaving them looking like a patchwork quilt. Towering evergreen trees dot the landscape, but locals here despise them for blocking the view of the ocean, prompting many homes to be built high up on the hill, boasting glass-fronted second floors for an expansive view of the bay. Sunsets here are breathtaking, with the water seeming to glow from below and the sky turning orange, though it's often overcast and damp, with moss thriving on surfaces. Children are few and far between, replaced by dogs that roam freely, often invading homes with open doors or windows. Rabbits and birds abound, with larger ones being hunted by local cats. A hike to the waterfront offers a few restaurants serving fresh seafood, and the bay, though narrow, offers an enjoyable spot for rock-throwing.",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area of a small southern town in Tennessee. Situated on a street that connects two state highways, our locale experiences a bit more traffic than I'd prefer, though the neighborhood remains generally quiet. The community is stable with minimal turnover, allowing me to become acquainted with most of the residents. The days are filled with neighbors tending to their yards and daily tasks. In winter, we enjoy sledding down the hill on our side street. Our house sits at the corner, giving us a front-row view of the comings and goings throughout the day and familiarizing us with the local vehicles. When an unfamiliar car appears, we take note. Neighbors engage in walks for exercise or to walk their pets. Children play on their bikes, much like any other typical suburban street. We're often home, as we work from our house. Comprising my wife and two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen, we're well-known to our neighbors. We venture outdoors for play, even in the rain, and enjoy grilling on our back deck. The pleasant aroma from the barbecue is a welcome scent. From March through October, the consistent hum of lawn mowers fills the air, as grass grows in abundance. Our neighborhood is shaded by many trees, originally a wooded area, resulting in a yearly task of raking and burning leaves. The smell of burning leaves signals the arrival of fall. Lately, winter has been scarce, making it feel like an extended fall. Our garage is located at the rear of our house, so we use the front door infrequently unless someone knocks, which is a rarity. I enjoy working in the garage on my truck or other projects, and having the garage doors open makes me more attuned to the neighborhood. During holidays, the area is quiet, with exceptions like Thanksgiving when neighborhood families host out-of-town guests, resulting in extra parked cars. Similar scenes occur for Mother's Day and Christmas. Overall, I find our neighborhood pleasant. If it weren't a through street, it would be ideal.",
            "My hood is smack dab in the middle of the high desert, where dirt is the norm, and green lawns are a rare sight. Unless you've been here, you can't grasp the constant brown landscape, and those who have lawns are probably spending a fortune on upkeep. When I first moved here in the 90s, houses were scattered far and wide. Now, they're still spread out, but there are plenty of new additions, making it feel more urban. Most people here are friendly, but like any city, there are good and bad parts. My neighborhood is filled with friendly old folks, which makes it a nice place to live. The stores here are mostly big chains like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want unique food, you'll have to travel, as I rarely see health food stores. The dominant industry here is construction, likely due to the city's underdevelopment and wide-open spaces. I'm a drywall and T-bar installer, which is why I'm so keen on keeping things as they are. The high desert is beautiful, and it's home to various wildlife. My kids love lizards and desert bugs, and I've adapted to living with these critters. If you visit, check out the San Bernardino County Fair while you're here. You can also hit up Wrightwood for some winter sports and learn about the high desert's natural history at the Victor Valley Museum.",
            "Let me tell you about my neighborhood - it's unique, I guess! Unlike the typical neighborhood where people own homes and live independent lives, my neighborhood is the college campus where I live. My dormitory is my community, and the surrounding campus, to a lesser extent, also forms part of my neighborhood. Despite this peculiarity, my college campus shares some similarities with more conventional neighborhoods. Just like a regular neighborhood, it has houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's dive into the houses first. You'll find three types of housing here: apartments, actual houses, and dormitories. In the apartments, there can be 2-4 people per room, with 4-6 rooms on each floor. Most buildings can house around 20 people. Then there are the actual houses, which are usually rented by school affiliates and come with 2-4 bedrooms. These are fewer and less efficient than the others. Lastly, the dorms house hundreds of students, with two people per room most of the time. Moving on to the people, my school prides itself on diversity, which is reflected in the mix of ages and cultures living in my neighborhood. The professional staff often reside in the houses, while newer students live in dorms and older students stay in apartments. My neighborhood is also home to a variety of stores, offering dining options and the school's unique clothing and grocery stores - you can find everything you need within our boundaries! Additionally, there's a park that serves as a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood. It's kept clean and free of crime by the community itself!",
            "Well, having been here for about a decade, I can certainly share some insights. Firstly, moving from Riverdale to Stockbridge was quite an adjustment for me. It wasn’t just a change of location; it meant leaving behind my friends and familiar surroundings. I even cried on our first day, missing the comfort of Riverdale. However, my parents had our best interests at heart, aiming for a better neighborhood, a better school, and a better life overall. Over time, I adapted and made new friends, albeit some also turned into enemies. I got to know our neighbors a bit, especially Mr. Glen and his family, and Dennis for a short while. They’ve been like family to me, and I cherish the times we’ve shared. One memorable moment was attending Mr. Glen’s wedding with my family. It was an enjoyable event, and I even caught the wedding bouquet! Although I missed it, I had a fantastic time with Marsharii, one of his daughters. I hope she’s doing well now.\n\nThe neighborhood has its quirks, like a maze, but with GPS, I can finally explore it more. I’ve spent time with friends like Kason and Curtis, playing video games and making the most of our time. Sometimes, I retreat to the park to find solace in nature. It’s my way of finding inner peace. I’ll also practice my balance with sticks from Home Depot and bring my bokken wooden sword whenever I can. It’s all about enjoying what I love. There’s a basketball and tennis court nearby, though I haven’t used them in a while. My dad and Mr. Graves taught me tennis, and we’d always have fun, even if it was intense training. There are plenty of fun stories from this neighborhood, and I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood, being close to the college I attend, is quite convenient. The area is mainly composed of apartment buildings, but there are also a few restaurants and bars that are affordable and generally enjoyable. One of the bars was recently renamed and, while it’s more expensive, the service and drinks are still decent. The majority of people here are either college students or have lower incomes, as the rent for apartments is quite reasonable. The neighborhood is also home to an elementary school, and there are quite a few children around. Though I don't know my neighbors, I don't mind, especially since they tend to smoke a lot of weed. In response, the management placed an air freshener unit near their doors, which my boyfriend and I found amusing. The buildings in this area are mostly old but often have modern interiors. Nearby, there are newer apartment complexes, but I'm not fond of them as they are cheaply constructed despite high rents, which I find a scam due to their proximity to the campus. There's a budget-friendly restaurant close by that serves food on paper plates and microwaves most of it. Across from it is a gas station, which I've heard is not the best place to work. However, the city recently improved the road with new sidewalks, grassy medians, and better road conditions, making the area nicer. My apartment complex is surrounded by trees, and some have been cut down, leaving stumps, but there are still plenty of trees. Behind my complex is another set of apartments, and I live on 42nd street, just behind which is 43rd street, which isn't as appealing. The sidewalks on 43rd street are in poor condition and the buildings look dilapidated, but there are trees that may be there to hide the buildings' condition. Crime is prevalent in the area, but it's not just limited to the apartments on 43rd street. Apartment complexes across from me also have their fair share of crime and a transient population. Despite all this, I enjoy living here as I can afford it and have easy access to useful amenities, including the university and two bus stops to get to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood is comprised of duplexes randomly scattered on a cul-de-sac, making it appear just like a collection of individual houses. Each is painted yellow, with white porches and green metal roofs, making it feel like stepping back in time. Most neighbors are friendly, and we often stand at the end of the driveway on some evenings, chatting while the kids play with their toys, sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. The surroundings are refreshing in this tech-filled world, with fields, trees, and blue skies with white clouds. However, this season we’ve had tornado warnings, and last night, we heard actual sirens. I found myself huddled in the bathtub with my smallest dog, purse, and a few pillows, while my bigger dog stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road was steaming from the temperature drop from 92°F to 75°F in minutes. The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement. As I looked up, the sun came out, and it started raining, forming a double rainbow. I quickly grabbed my camera and shared the pictures with my Facebook friends and family, who were in awe just like me. The streets remained quiet for an hour before people started returning home. Then it was back to normal, with moms and children outside while dinner cooked. It's a friendly neighborhood, perfect for this gal who recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I love the southern accent. I live in a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, as do most of my neighbors. While the houses look the same on the outside, not all apartments are the same on the inside; some are quite small. I enjoy walking along the biggest field behind my house and heading to the pond that isn't for swimming. I've seen deer, and in the mornings, you can hear a giant bullfrog singing. It's like living in a small community village. There’s even a donkey at a nearby farm that lets us know he’s there with his evening bray. I feel fortunate to have found this gem of a neighborhood, just forty minutes outside Charlotte. Each morning is greeted by the sound of roosters crowing from nearby farms. It's a peaceful, close-knit community.",
            "I made a big move just as I was about to start eighth grade, finding myself in a new neighborhood. It took some time to connect with folks, but eventually, I got friendly with someone two houses down and another chap on my street. They've since left, but the memories remain. The same faces I saw when I first arrived are still here. My neighborhood is a typical American suburban affair, filled with two-story houses. Weekends bring the sound of children playing outside, and most days are peaceful. I've never had any issues with my neighbors. I've ordered online packages without worry, and I feel comfortable asking for help when needed. There's a park nearby where I've played basketball, football, and baseball with neighborhood kids. Some of those games resulted in a broken nose, but the good times outweigh the bad. Now, I go there to spend time with my cousin's younger kids, who still enjoy the swings and slides. The park holds a special place in my heart, evoking nostalgic feelings.\n\nThis neighborhood is diverse, with a mix of cultures and cuisines. In a one-mile radius, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. These days, many people use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for delivery, but it's still easy to find fast food joints and pizza places. The stores are stocked with everything you could need, including dry cleaners, Walgreens, CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store. There's even an Indian-owned shop for those who want to cook or buy ready-made Indian food. All in all, I'm quite content with my neighborhood. Seeing the news and social media stories about other people's experiences with their neighbors makes me appreciate mine even more.",
            "My neighborhood is a charming little town nestled in South Carolina. While it blends in with other towns, Johnston stands out in the agriculture sector. The town is proudly known as the Peach Capital of the World, a moniker displayed on the warm welcome sign. The landscape is dominated by sprawling farmlands, with acres of peach orchards and cattle fields. The houses are scattered, typically two-story structures with metal or gray shingle roofs, providing respite from the scorching summers. Most homes are built away from the road, with front fields utilized for livestock or crops. In the town center, a solitary stoplight hangs at a four-way intersection, where the sole stores reside. You'll find a smorgasbord of fast food options, including a family-run Chinese restaurant called Hong Kong, a Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's burger joint. A beloved, albeit closed-down, pizzeria once operated here. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a cozy family pharmacy, is known for its Cherry Coca-Cola. The priciest grocery store is the Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA. Most locals prefer to shop at the nearby Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for their groceries, while the town's most frequented store is Dollar General. This store offers a wide array of everyday items and is bustling from morning till night. Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a community-loved woman, has been a staple for decades. Attached to it is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, offering various pet services like daycare, boarding, grooming, and more. Medical care is provided by small, well-equipped practices for both humans and animals, located away from the town center. Johnston Elementary School caters to students up to fifth grade, after which they must travel to the next town for middle and high school. The town is currently developing a 2.5-acre recreational area to provide families with more leisure opportunities and attract visitors. However, Johnston lacks many amenities like movie theaters or bowling alleys, but it's a peaceful place to pass through, so small that you might miss it in a blink!",
            "The first time I heard about where I live, it was during a podcast discussing people who'd vanished. It was a bit unexpected. The rent for almost every apartment in the area topped a thousand dollars a month, which none of my friends or I were aware of, possibly due to the struggle. Several of my friends often cry themselves to sleep at night, overwhelmed by the high cost of living. We've become thrifty over time, appreciating the dusty scents of flea market trinkets and mothballed clothes. You tend to smell less as an adult. Some might take up smoking, or they might simply be used to the current state of things. Yet, the flea market remains an attraction, with its smell of dusty magazines stacked on closed pianos that linger in the leather. Here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance, along with a charity thrift, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling, filled with cars and people every morning, but inside the thrift stores, it's eerily quiet. No matter how much traffic there is, the stores remain silent havens. Every year, the city grows denser, a hub for e-commerce and delivery, but it's still feeling the growing pains. It reminds me of New York - everyone's focused on their own goals, and you can be alone without much interference. You can maintain your privacy without anyone prying. It's not like the South, where concern translates to caring. Here, you're left alone as long as you remain quiet. I live in a vast, dehumanizing modernist sprawl, but it's the people like my neighbors who make it feel less isolating. We come together for our needs, celebrate life's milestones, and help each other out. I'm fortunate to live here. Most of my neighbors are friendly, and they treat me well. I make an effort to tidy up and leave food for them, and they do the same. We exchange mail and enjoy each other's company. It's nice to have them, and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a sprawl that can feel dehumanizing, but it's the people who make it feel like I haven't wasted my life entirely.",
            "The area where I reside can be categorized as your classic cookie cutter suburbia. The presence of a homeowner's association is quite evident upon entering. The neighborhood is characterized by meticulously maintained single-family homes, which we owe to the HOA. Front yards are all uniform, featuring a small patch of grass, decorative pebbles, and short driveways, with an occasional small tree. Every home boasts a two-car garage. As you drive through the neighborhood, you'll notice recently paved concrete roads in excellent condition, devoid of potholes. Most homes are single-story, though you may occasionally spot two-story dwellings. Mailboxes are community-style, with a large grouping at the end of the street, accessible via key. There are also two large lockers for packages, again, a testament to the HOA's obsession with uniformity. My neighborhood is situated on the outskirts of the city, blending elements of rural and suburban living. Consequently, we have ample space for community pools and walking trails maintained by the HOA. These amenities are accessible to all residents and are perfect for evening strolls or dog walking. The neighborhood is predominantly made up of retirees, fostering a sense of safety and community, with a few middle-aged and young professionals scattered throughout. The city itself is surprisingly populous yet retains a small-town feel. All major amenities are readily available, including a mall that, while not massive, serves its purpose. A 15-minute drive will take you to various shopping options, from high-end grocery stores offering organic produce to bargain outlets with limited staff and selection. In summary, my neighborhood is secure, well-kept, and pretty standard, offering pools, walking trails, and easy access to shopping amenities, albeit requiring a short drive.",
            "I reside in a small Midwestern town that's just on the outskirts of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, situated on the east side, is considered the most economically disadvantaged part of town. Most homes are rented or owned by low-income individuals, but it's not without its charms. My neighbors are usually friendly, greeting me with a smile as I walk down the street. Crime rates are slightly higher than other areas, but mostly non-violent. A few serious incidents, like shootings and a homicide, have occurred within a few blocks of my home over the past decade. Unfortunately, our neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Thankfully, our family hasn't faced direct crime issues, except for some occasional porch item thefts. The opioid epidemic has heavily impacted our town, claiming many lives due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there's community support through addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training for families. The elementary school, where my son attends, has excellent staff and a positive atmosphere, despite his special needs. There's an active PTO organizing events for family engagement and educational progress. Due to over 20% of the town's population living below the poverty line, the school provides free breakfast and lunch for all students. Costs for fees, supplies, and field trips are reasonable, ensuring no child or family feels left out. City improvements, like repaving roads and refurbishing parks, have mainly occurred in the center and west side of town, where shopping areas are located and most traffic passes. The east side, where I live, is often neglected, causing some discontent among residents. Despite these challenges, I enjoy living here. The community is generally friendly, the schools are excellent, and there are enough shopping options for our family's needs. Our home may not be worth much, but it's comfortable and adequate. We've lived here for over 16 years and can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My locale is a treasure trove of culture, situated on a hill and encircled by structures brimming with historical significance. I reside in a towering 7-story apartment block, right next to the historic live theater, and a stone's throw away, you'll find a charming arcade bar that draws various folks on warm summer nights, often with a line stretching around the block. A short distance up the road lies the city's main park, a vast green space that's conveniently located yet still big enough to offer respite from the bustling city life. Surrounding the park are concrete walls and steep steps, which during winter, house neatly arranged tents of homeless individuals, clustered together for warmth and proximity to the only family center within miles, where they can clean up and shower. While the city's architectural marvels are impressive, it is the people who truly make the neighborhood exceptional. Once notorious for gang violence, Hilltop is a testament to resilience and community spirit. Decades later, memories of federal raids and DEA crackdowns linger, but so does the unwavering determination of the residents to keep their city clean and vibrant. The warning to steer clear of Hilltop after dark, often echoed as a caution for whites, seems more like a nod to the past than a call to arms. Perhaps it's my own dark complexion or the fact that I've integrated myself into the community, but I feel a sense of belonging and acceptance here. I've experienced nights where I've been offered coats and even money by people who've seen me as a friend, not a target. It's a place where I feel alive, where kindness and humanity are as prevalent as the stories of the past.",
            "I reside in rural America, nestled in small-town Michigan, where you can switch from farmland to small tourist hubs without a second thought. Big city amenities like shopping malls, Walmart, Target, or even Applebee's are nonexistent. Every destination demands a drive, but that’s what makes it special—it’s surrounded by beautiful water. Lake Michigan graces one side, and Lake Charlevoix the other, offering beaches galore for a quick dip. My neighborhood is a textbook representation of small-town America. Houses are spaced out, not cookie-cutter, but older homes with full basements visible from the road. Aluminum siding colors the houses in a vibrant patchwork. Trampolines, playsets, gardens, and fences dot many yards. Neighbors are friendly, with kids running streets, people walking dogs, and people biking or rollerblading. Lawns are well-maintained, with tidy plants and bushes. It’s not an awe-inspiring neighborhood filled with luxurious homes, but a place where you feel safe and at home. A walk down the road brings you to the county sheriff’s department, the health department, and the city recycling center. Baseball and softball games can be heard nearby, as can the rumbles of small planes from the nearby airport. Ice cream from the local shop is a short walk, and the downtown is within biking distance. Safety, peace, and quiet are the hallmarks of this neighborhood, making it a fantastic place to raise a family."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

Residential areas are scattered amongst commercial zones featuring an array of businesses from offices to stores, restaurants, and entertainment spots. There's no shortage of eateries or shops to explore, with both large corporate chains and trendy boutiques lining the streets. Some stores are located in malls, while others are in walking distance from residential areas that might otherwise be peaceful. A couple of nearby parks attract families with young children. The neighborhood itself is a melting pot of cultures. In one area, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a mix of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Just outside the neighborhood, there are numerous ethnic enclaves like Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia, which are only a few miles away. However, navigating ten miles can sometimes take two hours due to traffic, especially during peak hours. Few people walk anywhere in the city, preferring to drive. Recent years have seen substantial construction, with new apartment buildings being added, which while attractive, has led to increased traffic and parking difficulties. My city offers a variety of housing options—single-family homes, duplexes, and smaller apartment buildings are all common. The neighborhood is diverse in age, and while I remember childhood memories of playing with neighbors, I don't know most of my current neighbors.

            "My neighborhood is a unique blend of old and new, much like the houses themselves. Most are single-family homes, but there are a few that have been divided into two, still attached to each other. My home has a small front yard and a driveway, just like many others, echoing a simpler time when the American dream was at its peak. But the dream seems to be fading, as the optimism of the past is gone. The yards are not as well-maintained as they once were, but there's still a car or two in every driveway, and children play as if the world revolves around them. The public school, standing tall for nearly nine decades, still influences the younger generation while evoking nostalgia in the elders. The churches are few and far between, usually empty, but the basketball courts are always bustling with activity.

The former karate school is now a pharmacy, a testament to the changing interests of the kids. The old movie theater plays classic films at discounted prices, attracting the elders but not the younger crowd. An expressway runs through our town, its exit and entrance in the neighboring town. There was a time when we tried to get an exit for our town, but the elders' concerns about ruining the town's essence swayed the city council. Now, a new high school is being built, and we're deciding on a mascot. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the perfect representation of our town.",

Nestled within these streets are several apartment complexes, lining up like Russian nesting dolls that have been carefully dismantled and placed side by side. The first set of apartments you'll see have been in the news for some unsavory incidents, so we won't dwell on those.

            "Portland, Oregon is a place defined by \"weirdness,\" with the unofficial town motto being \"Keep Portland Weird.\" For some, this is a nod to the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and more affordable, fostering creative and unique subcultures. For others, it's an invitation to embrace the weird, as Portland accepts what is often not accepted elsewhere. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and new condominiums, Portland remains weird. Weirdness isn't always acceptance, but it does embrace the unconventional. Portland has its modern conveniences and battles, like the rest of the country, importing most of its goods from China. There are countless ways to be weird, but Portland has plenty of normal too—yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Weirdness might mean we take all this less seriously. In my neighborhood, like many in Portland, we have colorful houses, home gardens, and free boxes in the summer, containing treasures for the unsuspecting passerby. Free boxes often include clothes and books, sometimes even plastic bags, and the magic of walking through Southeast Portland's neighborhoods is what Portland is all about. To me, it's about the variety of weirdness I encounter, but I'm just one among many. Some neighbors wouldn't dream of picking clothes from the sidewalk. They prefer goat yoga or Timbers matches. Portland is full of dreamers and dream-chasers, sometimes spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem, often due to mental health issues exacerbated by the constant rain and dreary weather. Homelessness is a significant issue, drawing many by better social services but insufficiently addressed. The non-homeless population oscillates between care and disdain, with Portland mirroring the country's general response to this problem. In this, Portland is not weird at all.",
            "The mountains are always present, bearing witness to the sun’s daily rise and set in the north. No matter how distracted by work and life I become, they stand firm, unshaken by life's challenges. On days when stress and worry overwhelm me, they demand my attention, and when I turn to them, they offer solace, lending me strength to continue. I first moved here for my undergrad, and the mountains north of campus were what initially captivated me. While the university boasts its own stunning landscapes in buildings, ponds, and trees, it's the mountains that truly hold my heart. The rest of the town is charming, with numerous cafés hosting countless hours of study sessions fueled by caffeine. A short walk or bus ride brings you to the downtown area, where faded brick buildings and historic restaurants create an atmosphere of bustle and vigor, just like its urban neighbor. This blend of city and town vibes makes the city feel like a place begging to be explored. This duality of atmospheres in such close proximity adds a magical touch, creating unforgettable memories associated with different parts of town. Whether it's walking past the old park swings with friends after an all-nighter or dashing through the busy downtown to catch a movie in the fancy theater with university tickets, the city offers a variety of experiences. However, it also holds harsh memories, as all places in life are bound to have them. The ponds, in particular, serve as a perfect spot for reflection and even crying sessions in the middle of the night during existential crises. While watching the turtles, ducks, and insects live out their lives, each with their role, I often pondered my own purpose as I navigated life's mysteries.

            "If you're heading to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, it's no sweat to find - public transportation is super convenient and it's one of NYC's top modes of transit. Bensonhurst is quite urban, so you'll feel right at home in the city. Get ready to see a ton of Asian stores when you visit. Over the past couple of decades, Bensonhurst has welcomed a lot of Asian residents, so you'll find Asian-owned shops on practically every block. Supermarkets and laundromats are the most common, and they're a hit with locals due to their top-notch food, cheaper prices, and convenience. There are at least four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk of each other near me, which makes grocery shopping a breeze. I wouldn't say Bensonhurst is Asian-only, though; it's pretty diverse, with immigrants and their children living there. Most of the big businesses are Asian-owned, and there's also a newly renovated park nearby with a bunch of sports facilities, a playground, and even a water fountain. Since we're in NYC, the park's pretty diverse, with people from all walks of life getting along. There aren't many big corporate buildings here; most are co-ops or condos. Most homes are two-family houses, and most people are friendly, but it can be noisy too. Every day, you'll hear cars blasting music and revving engines. At night, be cautious - while it's generally safe, people can be unpredictable and there's been some petty crime like theft and bullying. I've experienced this myself, but it was a while ago. There's also a bit of a dog waste issue - NYC has fines for not cleaning up, but people don't always follow the rules, so you'll see dog poop on the streets every morning. My biggest beef is stepping on dog waste everywhere. Watch your step and keep your shoes clean!",
            "Where I reside, sidewalks are scarce, and the terrain slopes sharply, with my house perched at the peak of the neighborhood's steepest hill, earning it the moniker \"workout hill\" among joggers. The street is just a road, riddled with potholes and hazardous to drive on, with tangled, weathered electrical and telephone wires crisscrossing overhead. Given our region's rainy and stormy climate, power lines are frequently damaged by falling debris, leaving them looking like a patchwork quilt. Towering evergreen trees dot the landscape, but locals here despise them for blocking the view of the ocean, prompting many homes to be built high up on the hill, boasting glass-fronted second floors for an expansive view of the bay. Sunsets here are breathtaking, with the water seeming to glow from below and the sky turning orange, though it's often overcast and damp, with moss thriving on surfaces. Children are few and far between, replaced by dogs that roam freely, often invading homes with open doors or windows. Rabbits and birds abound, with larger ones being hunted by local cats. A hike to the waterfront offers a few restaurants serving fresh seafood, and the bay, though narrow, offers an enjoyable spot for rock-throwing.",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area of a small southern town in Tennessee. Situated on a street that connects two state highways, our locale experiences a bit more traffic than I'd prefer, though the neighborhood remains generally quiet. The community is stable with minimal turnover, allowing me to become acquainted with most of the residents. The days are filled with neighbors tending to their yards and daily tasks. In winter, we enjoy sledding down the hill on our side street. Our house sits at the corner, giving us a front-row view of the comings and goings throughout the day and familiarizing us with the local vehicles. When an unfamiliar car appears, we take note. Neighbors engage in walks for exercise or to walk their pets. Children play on their bikes, much like any other typical suburban street. We're often home, as we work from our house. Comprising my wife and two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen, we're well-known to our neighbors. We venture outdoors for play, even in the rain, and enjoy grilling on our back deck. The pleasant aroma from the barbecue is a welcome scent. From March through October, the consistent hum of lawn mowers fills the air, as grass grows in abundance. Our neighborhood is shaded by many trees, originally a wooded area, resulting in a yearly task of raking and burning leaves. The smell of burning leaves signals the arrival of fall. Lately, winter has been scarce, making it feel like an extended fall. Our garage is located at the rear of our house, so we use the front door infrequently unless someone knocks, which is a rarity. I enjoy working in the garage on my truck or other projects, and having the garage doors open makes me more attuned to the neighborhood. During holidays, the area is quiet, with exceptions like Thanksgiving when neighborhood families host out-of-town guests, resulting in extra parked cars. Similar scenes occur for Mother's Day and Christmas. Overall, I find our neighborhood pleasant. If it weren't a through street, it would be ideal.",
            "My hood is smack dab in the middle of the high desert, where dirt is the norm, and green lawns are a rare sight. Unless you've been here, you can't grasp the constant brown landscape, and those who have lawns are probably spending a fortune on upkeep. When I first moved here in the 90s, houses were scattered far and wide. Now, they're still spread out, but there are plenty of new additions, making it feel more urban. Most people here are friendly, but like any city, there are good and bad parts. My neighborhood is filled with friendly old folks, which makes it a nice place to live. The stores here are mostly big chains like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want unique food, you'll have to travel, as I rarely see health food stores. The dominant industry here is construction, likely due to the city's underdevelopment and wide-open spaces. I'm a drywall and T-bar installer, which is why I'm so keen on keeping things as they are. The high desert is beautiful, and it's home to various wildlife. My kids love lizards and desert bugs, and I've adapted to living with these critters. If you visit, check out the San Bernardino County Fair while you're here. You can also hit up Wrightwood for some winter sports and learn about the high desert's natural history at the Victor Valley Museum.",
            "Let me tell you about my neighborhood - it's unique, I guess! Unlike the typical neighborhood where people own homes and live independent lives, my neighborhood is the college campus where I live. My dormitory is my community, and the surrounding campus, to a lesser extent, also forms part of my neighborhood. Despite this peculiarity, my college campus shares some similarities with more conventional neighborhoods. Just like a regular neighborhood, it has houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's dive into the houses first. You'll find three types of housing here: apartments, actual houses, and dormitories. In the apartments, there can be 2-4 people per room, with 4-6 rooms on each floor. Most buildings can house around 20 people. Then there are the actual houses, which are usually rented by school affiliates and come with 2-4 bedrooms. These are fewer and less efficient than the others. Lastly, the dorms house hundreds of students, with two people per room most of the time. Moving on to the people, my school prides itself on diversity, which is reflected in the mix of ages and cultures living in my neighborhood. The professional staff often reside in the houses, while newer students live in dorms and older students stay in apartments. My neighborhood is also home to a variety of stores, offering dining options and the school's unique clothing and grocery stores - you can find everything you need within our boundaries! Additionally, there's a park that serves as a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood. It's kept clean and free of crime by the community itself!",
            "Well, having been here for about a decade, I can certainly share some insights. Firstly, moving from Riverdale to Stockbridge was quite an adjustment for me. It wasn’t just a change of location; it meant leaving behind my friends and familiar surroundings. I even cried on our first day, missing the comfort of Riverdale. However, my parents had our best interests at heart, aiming for a better neighborhood, a better school, and a better life overall. Over time, I adapted and made new friends, albeit some also turned into enemies. I got to know our neighbors a bit, especially Mr. Glen and his family, and Dennis for a short while. They’ve been like family to me, and I cherish the times we’ve shared. One memorable moment was attending Mr. Glen’s wedding with my family. It was an enjoyable event, and I even caught the wedding bouquet! Although I missed it, I had a fantastic time with Marsharii, one of his daughters. I hope she’s doing well now.\n\nThe neighborhood has its quirks, like a maze, but with GPS, I can finally explore it more. I’ve spent time with friends like Kason and Curtis, playing video games and making the most of our time. Sometimes, I retreat to the park to find solace in nature. It’s my way of finding inner peace. I’ll also practice my balance with sticks from Home Depot and bring my bokken wooden sword whenever I can. It’s all about enjoying what I love. There’s a basketball and tennis court nearby, though I haven’t used them in a while. My dad and Mr. Graves taught me tennis, and we’d always have fun, even if it was intense training. There are plenty of fun stories from this neighborhood, and I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood, being close to the college I attend, is quite convenient. The area is mainly composed of apartment buildings, but there are also a few restaurants and bars that are affordable and generally enjoyable. One of the bars was recently renamed and, while it’s more expensive, the service and drinks are still decent. The majority of people here are either college students or have lower incomes, as the rent for apartments is quite reasonable. The neighborhood is also home to an elementary school, and there are quite a few children around. Though I don't know my neighbors, I don't mind, especially since they tend to smoke a lot of weed. In response, the management placed an air freshener unit near their doors, which my boyfriend and I found amusing. The buildings in this area are mostly old but often have modern interiors. Nearby, there are newer apartment complexes, but I'm not fond of them as they are cheaply constructed despite high rents, which I find a scam due to their proximity to the campus. There's a budget-friendly restaurant close by that serves food on paper plates and microwaves most of it. Across from it is a gas station, which I've heard is not the best place to work. However, the city recently improved the road with new sidewalks, grassy medians, and better road conditions, making the area nicer. My apartment complex is surrounded by trees, and some have been cut down, leaving stumps, but there are still plenty of trees. Behind my complex is another set of apartments, and I live on 42nd street, just behind which is 43rd street, which isn't as appealing. The sidewalks on 43rd street are in poor condition and the buildings look dilapidated, but there are trees that may be there to hide the buildings' condition. Crime is prevalent in the area, but it's not just limited to the apartments on 43rd street. Apartment complexes across from me also have their fair share of crime and a transient population. Despite all this, I enjoy living here as I can afford it and have easy access to useful amenities, including the university and two bus stops to get to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood is comprised of duplexes randomly scattered on a cul-de-sac, making it appear just like a collection of individual houses. Each is painted yellow, with white porches and green metal roofs, making it feel like stepping back in time. Most neighbors are friendly, and we often stand at the end of the driveway on some evenings, chatting while the kids play with their toys, sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. The surroundings are refreshing in this tech-filled world, with fields, trees, and blue skies with white clouds. However, this season we’ve had tornado warnings, and last night, we heard actual sirens. I found myself huddled in the bathtub with my smallest dog, purse, and a few pillows, while my bigger dog stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road was steaming from the temperature drop from 92°F to 75°F in minutes. The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement. As I looked up, the sun came out, and it started raining, forming a double rainbow. I quickly grabbed my camera and shared the pictures with my Facebook friends and family, who were in awe just like me. The streets remained quiet for an hour before people started returning home. Then it was back to normal, with moms and children outside while dinner cooked. It's a friendly neighborhood, perfect for this gal who recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I love the southern accent. I live in a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, as do most of my neighbors. While the houses look the same on the outside, not all apartments are the same on the inside; some are quite small. I enjoy walking along the biggest field behind my house and heading to the pond that isn't for swimming. I've seen deer, and in the mornings, you can hear a giant bullfrog singing. It's like living in a small community village. There’s even a donkey at a nearby farm that lets us know he’s there with his evening bray. I feel fortunate to have found this gem of a neighborhood, just forty minutes outside Charlotte. Each morning is greeted by the sound of roosters crowing from nearby farms. It's a peaceful, close-knit community.",
            "I made a big move just as I was about to start eighth grade, finding myself in a new neighborhood. It took some time to connect with folks, but eventually, I got friendly with someone two houses down and another chap on my street. They've since left, but the memories remain. The same faces I saw when I first arrived are still here. My neighborhood is a typical American suburban affair, filled with two-story houses. Weekends bring the sound of children playing outside, and most days are peaceful. I've never had any issues with my neighbors. I've ordered online packages without worry, and I feel comfortable asking for help when needed. There's a park nearby where I've played basketball, football, and baseball with neighborhood kids. Some of those games resulted in a broken nose, but the good times outweigh the bad. Now, I go there to spend time with my cousin's younger kids, who still enjoy the swings and slides. The park holds a special place in my heart, evoking nostalgic feelings.\n\nThis neighborhood is diverse, with a mix of cultures and cuisines. In a one-mile radius, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. These days, many people use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for delivery, but it's still easy to find fast food joints and pizza places. The stores are stocked with everything you could need, including dry cleaners, Walgreens, CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store. There's even an Indian-owned shop for those who want to cook or buy ready-made Indian food. All in all, I'm quite content with my neighborhood. Seeing the news and social media stories about other people's experiences with their neighbors makes me appreciate mine even more.",
            "My neighborhood is a charming little town nestled in South Carolina. While it blends in with other towns, Johnston stands out in the agriculture sector. The town is proudly known as the Peach Capital of the World, a moniker displayed on the warm welcome sign. The landscape is dominated by sprawling farmlands, with acres of peach orchards and cattle fields. The houses are scattered, typically two-story structures with metal or gray shingle roofs, providing respite from the scorching summers. Most homes are built away from the road, with front fields utilized for livestock or crops. In the town center, a solitary stoplight hangs at a four-way intersection, where the sole stores reside. You'll find a smorgasbord of fast food options, including a family-run Chinese restaurant called Hong Kong, a Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's burger joint. A beloved, albeit closed-down, pizzeria once operated here. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a cozy family pharmacy, is known for its Cherry Coca-Cola. The priciest grocery store is the Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA. Most locals prefer to shop at the nearby Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for their groceries, while the town's most frequented store is Dollar General. This store offers a wide array of everyday items and is bustling from morning till night. Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a community-loved woman, has been a staple for decades. Attached to it is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, offering various pet services like daycare, boarding, grooming, and more. Medical care is provided by small, well-equipped practices for both humans and animals, located away from the town center. Johnston Elementary School caters to students up to fifth grade, after which they must travel to the next town for middle and high school. The town is currently developing a 2.5-acre recreational area to provide families with more leisure opportunities and attract visitors. However, Johnston lacks many amenities like movie theaters or bowling alleys, but it's a peaceful place to pass through, so small that you might miss it in a blink!",
            "The first time I heard about where I live, it was during a podcast discussing people who'd vanished. It was a bit unexpected. The rent for almost every apartment in the area topped a thousand dollars a month, which none of my friends or I were aware of, possibly due to the struggle. Several of my friends often cry themselves to sleep at night, overwhelmed by the high cost of living. We've become thrifty over time, appreciating the dusty scents of flea market trinkets and mothballed clothes. You tend to smell less as an adult. Some might take up smoking, or they might simply be used to the current state of things. Yet, the flea market remains an attraction, with its smell of dusty magazines stacked on closed pianos that linger in the leather. Here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance, along with a charity thrift, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling, filled with cars and people every morning, but inside the thrift stores, it's eerily quiet. No matter how much traffic there is, the stores remain silent havens. Every year, the city grows denser, a hub for e-commerce and delivery, but it's still feeling the growing pains. It reminds me of New York - everyone's focused on their own goals, and you can be alone without much interference. You can maintain your privacy without anyone prying. It's not like the South, where concern translates to caring. Here, you're left alone as long as you remain quiet. I live in a vast, dehumanizing modernist sprawl, but it's the people like my neighbors who make it feel less isolating. We come together for our needs, celebrate life's milestones, and help each other out. I'm fortunate to live here. Most of my neighbors are friendly, and they treat me well. I make an effort to tidy up and leave food for them, and they do the same. We exchange mail and enjoy each other's company. It's nice to have them, and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a sprawl that can feel dehumanizing, but it's the people who make it feel like I haven't wasted my life entirely.",
            "The area where I reside can be categorized as your classic cookie cutter suburbia. The presence of a homeowner's association is quite evident upon entering. The neighborhood is characterized by meticulously maintained single-family homes, which we owe to the HOA. Front yards are all uniform, featuring a small patch of grass, decorative pebbles, and short driveways, with an occasional small tree. Every home boasts a two-car garage. As you drive through the neighborhood, you'll notice recently paved concrete roads in excellent condition, devoid of potholes. Most homes are single-story, though you may occasionally spot two-story dwellings. Mailboxes are community-style, with a large grouping at the end of the street, accessible via key. There are also two large lockers for packages, again, a testament to the HOA's obsession with uniformity. My neighborhood is situated on the outskirts of the city, blending elements of rural and suburban living. Consequently, we have ample space for community pools and walking trails maintained by the HOA. These amenities are accessible to all residents and are perfect for evening strolls or dog walking. The neighborhood is predominantly made up of retirees, fostering a sense of safety and community, with a few middle-aged and young professionals scattered throughout. The city itself is surprisingly populous yet retains a small-town feel. All major amenities are readily available, including a mall that, while not massive, serves its purpose. A 15-minute drive will take you to various shopping options, from high-end grocery stores offering organic produce to bargain outlets with limited staff and selection. In summary, my neighborhood is secure, well-kept, and pretty standard, offering pools, walking trails, and easy access to shopping amenities, albeit requiring a short drive.",
            "I reside in a small Midwestern town that's just on the outskirts of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, situated on the east side, is considered the most economically disadvantaged part of town. Most homes are rented or owned by low-income individuals, but it's not without its charms. My neighbors are usually friendly, greeting me with a smile as I walk down the street. Crime rates are slightly higher than other areas, but mostly non-violent. A few serious incidents, like shootings and a homicide, have occurred within a few blocks of my home over the past decade. Unfortunately, our neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Thankfully, our family hasn't faced direct crime issues, except for some occasional porch item thefts. The opioid epidemic has heavily impacted our town, claiming many lives due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there's community support through addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training for families. The elementary school, where my son attends, has excellent staff and a positive atmosphere, despite his special needs. There's an active PTO organizing events for family engagement and educational progress. Due to over 20% of the town's population living below the poverty line, the school provides free breakfast and lunch for all students. Costs for fees, supplies, and field trips are reasonable, ensuring no child or family feels left out. City improvements, like repaving roads and refurbishing parks, have mainly occurred in the center and west side of town, where shopping areas are located and most traffic passes. The east side, where I live, is often neglected, causing some discontent among residents. Despite these challenges, I enjoy living here. The community is generally friendly, the schools are excellent, and there are enough shopping options for our family's needs. Our home may not be worth much, but it's comfortable and adequate. We've lived here for over 16 years and can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My locale is a treasure trove of culture, situated on a hill and encircled by structures brimming with historical significance. I reside in a towering 7-story apartment block, right next to the historic live theater, and a stone's throw away, you'll find a charming arcade bar that draws various folks on warm summer nights, often with a line stretching around the block. A short distance up the road lies the city's main park, a vast green space that's conveniently located yet still big enough to offer respite from the bustling city life. Surrounding the park are concrete walls and steep steps, which during winter, house neatly arranged tents of homeless individuals, clustered together for warmth and proximity to the only family center within miles, where they can clean up and shower. While the city's architectural marvels are impressive, it is the people who truly make the neighborhood exceptional. Once notorious for gang violence, Hilltop is a testament to resilience and community spirit. Decades later, memories of federal raids and DEA crackdowns linger, but so does the unwavering determination of the residents to keep their city clean and vibrant. The warning to steer clear of Hilltop after dark, often echoed as a caution for whites, seems more like a nod to the past than a call to arms. Perhaps it's my own dark complexion or the fact that I've integrated myself into the community, but I feel a sense of belonging and acceptance here. I've experienced nights where I've been offered coats and even money by people who've seen me as a friend, not a target. It's a place where I feel alive, where kindness and humanity are as prevalent as the stories of the past.",
            "I reside in rural America, nestled in small-town Michigan, where you can switch from farmland to small tourist hubs without a second thought. Big city amenities like shopping malls, Walmart, Target, or even Applebee's are nonexistent. Every destination demands a drive, but that’s what makes it special—it’s surrounded by beautiful water. Lake Michigan graces one side, and Lake Charlevoix the other, offering beaches galore for a quick dip. My neighborhood is a textbook representation of small-town America. Houses are spaced out, not cookie-cutter, but older homes with full basements visible from the road. Aluminum siding colors the houses in a vibrant patchwork. Trampolines, playsets, gardens, and fences dot many yards. Neighbors are friendly, with kids running streets, people walking dogs, and people biking or rollerblading. Lawns are well-maintained, with tidy plants and bushes. It’s not an awe-inspiring neighborhood filled with luxurious homes, but a place where you feel safe and at home. A walk down the road brings you to the county sheriff’s department, the health department, and the city recycling center. Baseball and softball games can be heard nearby, as can the rumbles of small planes from the nearby airport. Ice cream from the local shop is a short walk, and the downtown is within biking distance. Safety, peace, and quiet are the hallmarks of this neighborhood, making it a fantastic place to raise a family."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

Residential areas are scattered amongst commercial zones featuring an array of businesses from offices to stores, restaurants, and entertainment spots.

Just outside the neighborhood, there are numerous ethnic enclaves like Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia, which are only a few miles away. However, navigating ten miles can sometimes take two hours due to traffic, especially during peak hours. Few people walk anywhere in the city, preferring to drive. Recent years have seen substantial construction, with new apartment buildings being added, which while attractive, has led to increased traffic and parking difficulties. My city offers a variety of housing options—single-family homes, duplexes, and smaller apartment buildings are all common.

Most are single-family homes, but there are a few that have been divided into two, still attached to each other. My home has a small front yard and a driveway, just like many others, echoing a simpler time when the American dream was at its peak. But the dream seems to be fading, as the optimism of the past is gone. The yards are not as well-maintained as they once were, but there's still a car or two in every driveway, and children play as if the world revolves around them. The public school, standing tall for nearly nine decades, still influences the younger generation while evoking nostalgia in the elders.

            "Portland, Oregon is a place defined by \"weirdness,\" with the unofficial town motto being \"Keep Portland Weird.\" For some, this is a nod to the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and more affordable, fostering creative and unique subcultures. For others, it's an invitation to embrace the weird, as Portland accepts what is often not accepted elsewhere. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and new condominiums, Portland remains weird. Weirdness isn't always acceptance, but it does embrace the unconventional. Portland has its modern conveniences and battles, like the rest of the country, importing most of its goods from China. There are countless ways to be weird, but Portland has plenty of normal too—yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Weirdness might mean we take all this less seriously. In my neighborhood, like many in Portland, we have colorful houses, home gardens, and free boxes in the summer, containing treasures for the unsuspecting passerby. Free boxes often include clothes and books, sometimes even plastic bags, and the magic of walking through Southeast Portland's neighborhoods is what Portland is all about. To me, it's about the variety of weirdness I encounter, but I'm just one among many. Some neighbors wouldn't dream of picking clothes from the sidewalk. They prefer goat yoga or Timbers matches. Portland is full of dreamers and dream-chasers, sometimes spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem, often due to mental health issues exacerbated by the constant rain and dreary weather. Homelessness is a significant issue, drawing many by better social services but insufficiently addressed. The non-homeless population oscillates between care and disdain, with Portland mirroring the country's general response to this problem. In this, Portland is not weird at all.",

No matter how distracted by work and life I become, they stand firm, unshaken by life's challenges. On days when stress and worry overwhelm me, they demand my attention, and when I turn to them, they offer solace, lending me strength to continue. I first moved here for my undergrad, and the mountains north of campus were what initially captivated me. While the university boasts its own stunning landscapes in buildings, ponds, and trees, it's the mountains that truly hold my heart. The rest of the town is charming, with numerous cafés hosting countless hours of study sessions fueled by caffeine.

            "If you're heading to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, it's no sweat to find - public transportation is super convenient and it's one of NYC's top modes of transit. Bensonhurst is quite urban, so you'll feel right at home in the city. Get ready to see a ton of Asian stores when you visit. Over the past couple of decades, Bensonhurst has welcomed a lot of Asian residents, so you'll find Asian-owned shops on practically every block. Supermarkets and laundromats are the most common, and they're a hit with locals due to their top-notch food, cheaper prices, and convenience. There are at least four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk of each other near me, which makes grocery shopping a breeze. I wouldn't say Bensonhurst is Asian-only, though; it's pretty diverse, with immigrants and their children living there. Most of the big businesses are Asian-owned, and there's also a newly renovated park nearby with a bunch of sports facilities, a playground, and even a water fountain. Since we're in NYC, the park's pretty diverse, with people from all walks of life getting along. There aren't many big corporate buildings here; most are co-ops or condos. Most homes are two-family houses, and most people are friendly, but it can be noisy too. Every day, you'll hear cars blasting music and revving engines. At night, be cautious - while it's generally safe, people can be unpredictable and there's been some petty crime like theft and bullying. I've experienced this myself, but it was a while ago. There's also a bit of a dog waste issue - NYC has fines for not cleaning up, but people don't always follow the rules, so you'll see dog poop on the streets every morning. My biggest beef is stepping on dog waste everywhere. Watch your step and keep your shoes clean!",
            "Where I reside, sidewalks are scarce, and the terrain slopes sharply, with my house perched at the peak of the neighborhood's steepest hill, earning it the moniker \"workout hill\" among joggers. The street is just a road, riddled with potholes and hazardous to drive on, with tangled, weathered electrical and telephone wires crisscrossing overhead. Given our region's rainy and stormy climate, power lines are frequently damaged by falling debris, leaving them looking like a patchwork quilt. Towering evergreen trees dot the landscape, but locals here despise them for blocking the view of the ocean, prompting many homes to be built high up on the hill, boasting glass-fronted second floors for an expansive view of the bay. Sunsets here are breathtaking, with the water seeming to glow from below and the sky turning orange, though it's often overcast and damp, with moss thriving on surfaces. Children are few and far between, replaced by dogs that roam freely, often invading homes with open doors or windows. Rabbits and birds abound, with larger ones being hunted by local cats. A hike to the waterfront offers a few restaurants serving fresh seafood, and the bay, though narrow, offers an enjoyable spot for rock-throwing.",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area of a small southern town in Tennessee. Situated on a street that connects two state highways, our locale experiences a bit more traffic than I'd prefer, though the neighborhood remains generally quiet. The community is stable with minimal turnover, allowing me to become acquainted with most of the residents. The days are filled with neighbors tending to their yards and daily tasks. In winter, we enjoy sledding down the hill on our side street. Our house sits at the corner, giving us a front-row view of the comings and goings throughout the day and familiarizing us with the local vehicles. When an unfamiliar car appears, we take note. Neighbors engage in walks for exercise or to walk their pets. Children play on their bikes, much like any other typical suburban street. We're often home, as we work from our house. Comprising my wife and two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen, we're well-known to our neighbors. We venture outdoors for play, even in the rain, and enjoy grilling on our back deck. The pleasant aroma from the barbecue is a welcome scent. From March through October, the consistent hum of lawn mowers fills the air, as grass grows in abundance. Our neighborhood is shaded by many trees, originally a wooded area, resulting in a yearly task of raking and burning leaves. The smell of burning leaves signals the arrival of fall. Lately, winter has been scarce, making it feel like an extended fall. Our garage is located at the rear of our house, so we use the front door infrequently unless someone knocks, which is a rarity. I enjoy working in the garage on my truck or other projects, and having the garage doors open makes me more attuned to the neighborhood. During holidays, the area is quiet, with exceptions like Thanksgiving when neighborhood families host out-of-town guests, resulting in extra parked cars. Similar scenes occur for Mother's Day and Christmas. Overall, I find our neighborhood pleasant. If it weren't a through street, it would be ideal.",
            "My hood is smack dab in the middle of the high desert, where dirt is the norm, and green lawns are a rare sight. Unless you've been here, you can't grasp the constant brown landscape, and those who have lawns are probably spending a fortune on upkeep. When I first moved here in the 90s, houses were scattered far and wide. Now, they're still spread out, but there are plenty of new additions, making it feel more urban. Most people here are friendly, but like any city, there are good and bad parts. My neighborhood is filled with friendly old folks, which makes it a nice place to live. The stores here are mostly big chains like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want unique food, you'll have to travel, as I rarely see health food stores. The dominant industry here is construction, likely due to the city's underdevelopment and wide-open spaces. I'm a drywall and T-bar installer, which is why I'm so keen on keeping things as they are. The high desert is beautiful, and it's home to various wildlife. My kids love lizards and desert bugs, and I've adapted to living with these critters. If you visit, check out the San Bernardino County Fair while you're here. You can also hit up Wrightwood for some winter sports and learn about the high desert's natural history at the Victor Valley Museum.",
            "Let me tell you about my neighborhood - it's unique, I guess! Unlike the typical neighborhood where people own homes and live independent lives, my neighborhood is the college campus where I live. My dormitory is my community, and the surrounding campus, to a lesser extent, also forms part of my neighborhood. Despite this peculiarity, my college campus shares some similarities with more conventional neighborhoods. Just like a regular neighborhood, it has houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's dive into the houses first. You'll find three types of housing here: apartments, actual houses, and dormitories. In the apartments, there can be 2-4 people per room, with 4-6 rooms on each floor. Most buildings can house around 20 people. Then there are the actual houses, which are usually rented by school affiliates and come with 2-4 bedrooms. These are fewer and less efficient than the others. Lastly, the dorms house hundreds of students, with two people per room most of the time. Moving on to the people, my school prides itself on diversity, which is reflected in the mix of ages and cultures living in my neighborhood. The professional staff often reside in the houses, while newer students live in dorms and older students stay in apartments. My neighborhood is also home to a variety of stores, offering dining options and the school's unique clothing and grocery stores - you can find everything you need within our boundaries! Additionally, there's a park that serves as a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood. It's kept clean and free of crime by the community itself!",
            "Well, having been here for about a decade, I can certainly share some insights. Firstly, moving from Riverdale to Stockbridge was quite an adjustment for me. It wasn’t just a change of location; it meant leaving behind my friends and familiar surroundings. I even cried on our first day, missing the comfort of Riverdale. However, my parents had our best interests at heart, aiming for a better neighborhood, a better school, and a better life overall. Over time, I adapted and made new friends, albeit some also turned into enemies. I got to know our neighbors a bit, especially Mr. Glen and his family, and Dennis for a short while. They’ve been like family to me, and I cherish the times we’ve shared. One memorable moment was attending Mr. Glen’s wedding with my family. It was an enjoyable event, and I even caught the wedding bouquet! Although I missed it, I had a fantastic time with Marsharii, one of his daughters. I hope she’s doing well now.\n\nThe neighborhood has its quirks, like a maze, but with GPS, I can finally explore it more. I’ve spent time with friends like Kason and Curtis, playing video games and making the most of our time. Sometimes, I retreat to the park to find solace in nature. It’s my way of finding inner peace. I’ll also practice my balance with sticks from Home Depot and bring my bokken wooden sword whenever I can. It’s all about enjoying what I love. There’s a basketball and tennis court nearby, though I haven’t used them in a while. My dad and Mr. Graves taught me tennis, and we’d always have fun, even if it was intense training. There are plenty of fun stories from this neighborhood, and I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood, being close to the college I attend, is quite convenient. The area is mainly composed of apartment buildings, but there are also a few restaurants and bars that are affordable and generally enjoyable. One of the bars was recently renamed and, while it’s more expensive, the service and drinks are still decent. The majority of people here are either college students or have lower incomes, as the rent for apartments is quite reasonable. The neighborhood is also home to an elementary school, and there are quite a few children around. Though I don't know my neighbors, I don't mind, especially since they tend to smoke a lot of weed. In response, the management placed an air freshener unit near their doors, which my boyfriend and I found amusing. The buildings in this area are mostly old but often have modern interiors. Nearby, there are newer apartment complexes, but I'm not fond of them as they are cheaply constructed despite high rents, which I find a scam due to their proximity to the campus. There's a budget-friendly restaurant close by that serves food on paper plates and microwaves most of it. Across from it is a gas station, which I've heard is not the best place to work. However, the city recently improved the road with new sidewalks, grassy medians, and better road conditions, making the area nicer. My apartment complex is surrounded by trees, and some have been cut down, leaving stumps, but there are still plenty of trees. Behind my complex is another set of apartments, and I live on 42nd street, just behind which is 43rd street, which isn't as appealing. The sidewalks on 43rd street are in poor condition and the buildings look dilapidated, but there are trees that may be there to hide the buildings' condition. Crime is prevalent in the area, but it's not just limited to the apartments on 43rd street. Apartment complexes across from me also have their fair share of crime and a transient population. Despite all this, I enjoy living here as I can afford it and have easy access to useful amenities, including the university and two bus stops to get to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood is comprised of duplexes randomly scattered on a cul-de-sac, making it appear just like a collection of individual houses. Each is painted yellow, with white porches and green metal roofs, making it feel like stepping back in time. Most neighbors are friendly, and we often stand at the end of the driveway on some evenings, chatting while the kids play with their toys, sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. The surroundings are refreshing in this tech-filled world, with fields, trees, and blue skies with white clouds. However, this season we’ve had tornado warnings, and last night, we heard actual sirens. I found myself huddled in the bathtub with my smallest dog, purse, and a few pillows, while my bigger dog stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road was steaming from the temperature drop from 92°F to 75°F in minutes. The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement. As I looked up, the sun came out, and it started raining, forming a double rainbow. I quickly grabbed my camera and shared the pictures with my Facebook friends and family, who were in awe just like me. The streets remained quiet for an hour before people started returning home. Then it was back to normal, with moms and children outside while dinner cooked. It's a friendly neighborhood, perfect for this gal who recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I love the southern accent. I live in a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, as do most of my neighbors. While the houses look the same on the outside, not all apartments are the same on the inside; some are quite small. I enjoy walking along the biggest field behind my house and heading to the pond that isn't for swimming. I've seen deer, and in the mornings, you can hear a giant bullfrog singing. It's like living in a small community village. There’s even a donkey at a nearby farm that lets us know he’s there with his evening bray. I feel fortunate to have found this gem of a neighborhood, just forty minutes outside Charlotte. Each morning is greeted by the sound of roosters crowing from nearby farms. It's a peaceful, close-knit community.",
            "I made a big move just as I was about to start eighth grade, finding myself in a new neighborhood. It took some time to connect with folks, but eventually, I got friendly with someone two houses down and another chap on my street. They've since left, but the memories remain. The same faces I saw when I first arrived are still here. My neighborhood is a typical American suburban affair, filled with two-story houses. Weekends bring the sound of children playing outside, and most days are peaceful. I've never had any issues with my neighbors. I've ordered online packages without worry, and I feel comfortable asking for help when needed. There's a park nearby where I've played basketball, football, and baseball with neighborhood kids. Some of those games resulted in a broken nose, but the good times outweigh the bad. Now, I go there to spend time with my cousin's younger kids, who still enjoy the swings and slides. The park holds a special place in my heart, evoking nostalgic feelings.\n\nThis neighborhood is diverse, with a mix of cultures and cuisines. In a one-mile radius, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. These days, many people use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for delivery, but it's still easy to find fast food joints and pizza places. The stores are stocked with everything you could need, including dry cleaners, Walgreens, CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store. There's even an Indian-owned shop for those who want to cook or buy ready-made Indian food. All in all, I'm quite content with my neighborhood. Seeing the news and social media stories about other people's experiences with their neighbors makes me appreciate mine even more.",
            "My neighborhood is a charming little town nestled in South Carolina. While it blends in with other towns, Johnston stands out in the agriculture sector. The town is proudly known as the Peach Capital of the World, a moniker displayed on the warm welcome sign. The landscape is dominated by sprawling farmlands, with acres of peach orchards and cattle fields. The houses are scattered, typically two-story structures with metal or gray shingle roofs, providing respite from the scorching summers. Most homes are built away from the road, with front fields utilized for livestock or crops. In the town center, a solitary stoplight hangs at a four-way intersection, where the sole stores reside. You'll find a smorgasbord of fast food options, including a family-run Chinese restaurant called Hong Kong, a Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's burger joint. A beloved, albeit closed-down, pizzeria once operated here. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a cozy family pharmacy, is known for its Cherry Coca-Cola. The priciest grocery store is the Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA. Most locals prefer to shop at the nearby Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for their groceries, while the town's most frequented store is Dollar General. This store offers a wide array of everyday items and is bustling from morning till night. Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a community-loved woman, has been a staple for decades. Attached to it is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, offering various pet services like daycare, boarding, grooming, and more. Medical care is provided by small, well-equipped practices for both humans and animals, located away from the town center. Johnston Elementary School caters to students up to fifth grade, after which they must travel to the next town for middle and high school. The town is currently developing a 2.5-acre recreational area to provide families with more leisure opportunities and attract visitors. However, Johnston lacks many amenities like movie theaters or bowling alleys, but it's a peaceful place to pass through, so small that you might miss it in a blink!",
            "The first time I heard about where I live, it was during a podcast discussing people who'd vanished. It was a bit unexpected. The rent for almost every apartment in the area topped a thousand dollars a month, which none of my friends or I were aware of, possibly due to the struggle. Several of my friends often cry themselves to sleep at night, overwhelmed by the high cost of living. We've become thrifty over time, appreciating the dusty scents of flea market trinkets and mothballed clothes. You tend to smell less as an adult. Some might take up smoking, or they might simply be used to the current state of things. Yet, the flea market remains an attraction, with its smell of dusty magazines stacked on closed pianos that linger in the leather. Here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance, along with a charity thrift, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling, filled with cars and people every morning, but inside the thrift stores, it's eerily quiet. No matter how much traffic there is, the stores remain silent havens. Every year, the city grows denser, a hub for e-commerce and delivery, but it's still feeling the growing pains. It reminds me of New York - everyone's focused on their own goals, and you can be alone without much interference. You can maintain your privacy without anyone prying. It's not like the South, where concern translates to caring. Here, you're left alone as long as you remain quiet. I live in a vast, dehumanizing modernist sprawl, but it's the people like my neighbors who make it feel less isolating. We come together for our needs, celebrate life's milestones, and help each other out. I'm fortunate to live here. Most of my neighbors are friendly, and they treat me well. I make an effort to tidy up and leave food for them, and they do the same. We exchange mail and enjoy each other's company. It's nice to have them, and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a sprawl that can feel dehumanizing, but it's the people who make it feel like I haven't wasted my life entirely.",
            "The area where I reside can be categorized as your classic cookie cutter suburbia. The presence of a homeowner's association is quite evident upon entering. The neighborhood is characterized by meticulously maintained single-family homes, which we owe to the HOA. Front yards are all uniform, featuring a small patch of grass, decorative pebbles, and short driveways, with an occasional small tree. Every home boasts a two-car garage. As you drive through the neighborhood, you'll notice recently paved concrete roads in excellent condition, devoid of potholes. Most homes are single-story, though you may occasionally spot two-story dwellings. Mailboxes are community-style, with a large grouping at the end of the street, accessible via key. There are also two large lockers for packages, again, a testament to the HOA's obsession with uniformity. My neighborhood is situated on the outskirts of the city, blending elements of rural and suburban living. Consequently, we have ample space for community pools and walking trails maintained by the HOA. These amenities are accessible to all residents and are perfect for evening strolls or dog walking. The neighborhood is predominantly made up of retirees, fostering a sense of safety and community, with a few middle-aged and young professionals scattered throughout. The city itself is surprisingly populous yet retains a small-town feel. All major amenities are readily available, including a mall that, while not massive, serves its purpose. A 15-minute drive will take you to various shopping options, from high-end grocery stores offering organic produce to bargain outlets with limited staff and selection. In summary, my neighborhood is secure, well-kept, and pretty standard, offering pools, walking trails, and easy access to shopping amenities, albeit requiring a short drive.",
            "I reside in a small Midwestern town that's just on the outskirts of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, situated on the east side, is considered the most economically disadvantaged part of town. Most homes are rented or owned by low-income individuals, but it's not without its charms. My neighbors are usually friendly, greeting me with a smile as I walk down the street. Crime rates are slightly higher than other areas, but mostly non-violent. A few serious incidents, like shootings and a homicide, have occurred within a few blocks of my home over the past decade. Unfortunately, our neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Thankfully, our family hasn't faced direct crime issues, except for some occasional porch item thefts. The opioid epidemic has heavily impacted our town, claiming many lives due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there's community support through addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training for families. The elementary school, where my son attends, has excellent staff and a positive atmosphere, despite his special needs. There's an active PTO organizing events for family engagement and educational progress. Due to over 20% of the town's population living below the poverty line, the school provides free breakfast and lunch for all students. Costs for fees, supplies, and field trips are reasonable, ensuring no child or family feels left out. City improvements, like repaving roads and refurbishing parks, have mainly occurred in the center and west side of town, where shopping areas are located and most traffic passes. The east side, where I live, is often neglected, causing some discontent among residents. Despite these challenges, I enjoy living here. The community is generally friendly, the schools are excellent, and there are enough shopping options for our family's needs. Our home may not be worth much, but it's comfortable and adequate. We've lived here for over 16 years and can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My locale is a treasure trove of culture, situated on a hill and encircled by structures brimming with historical significance. I reside in a towering 7-story apartment block, right next to the historic live theater, and a stone's throw away, you'll find a charming arcade bar that draws various folks on warm summer nights, often with a line stretching around the block. A short distance up the road lies the city's main park, a vast green space that's conveniently located yet still big enough to offer respite from the bustling city life. Surrounding the park are concrete walls and steep steps, which during winter, house neatly arranged tents of homeless individuals, clustered together for warmth and proximity to the only family center within miles, where they can clean up and shower. While the city's architectural marvels are impressive, it is the people who truly make the neighborhood exceptional. Once notorious for gang violence, Hilltop is a testament to resilience and community spirit. Decades later, memories of federal raids and DEA crackdowns linger, but so does the unwavering determination of the residents to keep their city clean and vibrant. The warning to steer clear of Hilltop after dark, often echoed as a caution for whites, seems more like a nod to the past than a call to arms. Perhaps it's my own dark complexion or the fact that I've integrated myself into the community, but I feel a sense of belonging and acceptance here. I've experienced nights where I've been offered coats and even money by people who've seen me as a friend, not a target. It's a place where I feel alive, where kindness and humanity are as prevalent as the stories of the past.",
            "I reside in rural America, nestled in small-town Michigan, where you can switch from farmland to small tourist hubs without a second thought. Big city amenities like shopping malls, Walmart, Target, or even Applebee's are nonexistent. Every destination demands a drive, but that’s what makes it special—it’s surrounded by beautiful water. Lake Michigan graces one side, and Lake Charlevoix the other, offering beaches galore for a quick dip. My neighborhood is a textbook representation of small-town America. Houses are spaced out, not cookie-cutter, but older homes with full basements visible from the road. Aluminum siding colors the houses in a vibrant patchwork. Trampolines, playsets, gardens, and fences dot many yards. Neighbors are friendly, with kids running streets, people walking dogs, and people biking or rollerblading. Lawns are well-maintained, with tidy plants and bushes. It’s not an awe-inspiring neighborhood filled with luxurious homes, but a place where you feel safe and at home. A walk down the road brings you to the county sheriff’s department, the health department, and the city recycling center. Baseball and softball games can be heard nearby, as can the rumbles of small planes from the nearby airport. Ice cream from the local shop is a short walk, and the downtown is within biking distance. Safety, peace, and quiet are the hallmarks of this neighborhood, making it a fantastic place to raise a family."
