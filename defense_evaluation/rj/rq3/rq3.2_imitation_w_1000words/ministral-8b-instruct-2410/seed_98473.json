            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

My house has a small front yard and a driveway to the left. It, along with many others, brings back a sense of the suburban American dream that was once vibrant but now seems to be fading. The dream still holds, but the optimism that once fueled it is waning. Keeping up with the yards is a chore, and the once-bustling driveways have fewer cars. Kids still play football, oblivious to the world around them, while the public school, standing tall after nearly a century, inspires dreams in the youth and stirs nostalgic memories in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, often empty, but the basketball courts remain full. Each house looks unique but feels the same, echoing a shared history.

Weird doesn't mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that aren't typically accepted. Weird doesn't mean we don't have modern amenities or modern problems.

They greet the sun's journey every morning and evening, unperturbed by the ebb and flow of life. When life's pressures overwhelm me, the mountains remind me to seek solace in their grandeur. I first encountered them when I started my undergrad; they've been a constant companion since. While the university boasts its own stunning landscapes, the mountains hold a special place in my heart. The town itself is a blend of bustling urban energy and serene suburban charm. Its cafés have been the backdrop to countless study sessions fueled by caffeine. A short bus ride or walk takes you to the downtown area, where vintage brick buildings and lively eateries create an atmosphere of vibrancy. This urban energy fades into quiet residential neighborhoods near the library, offering a stark contrast and an invitation to explore. The town is a treasure trove of cherished memories, from late-night chats with friends by the park to movie nights at the university's fancy theater. Yet, it's also remembered for more somber moments, such as late-night reflections by the pond. While watching the pond's inhabitants go about their lives, I've often pondered my own purpose. The mountains, ever-present, have been there to remind me of my resilience. As I walked to a main street, the sun painted the sky with brilliant hues, and I realized I was heading north, towards the mountains. There they were, towering and steadfast, their peaks reaching for the sky. They stirred within me a sense of perseverance, a reminder to keep moving forward, one day at a time.",
            "If you plan on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you won't have any trouble locating it! Public transportation is incredibly accessible and is one of the most popular ways to get around in New York City. Bensonhurt is an urban neighborhood, so you'll still feel like you're in the heart of the city. Expect to see numerous Asian stores during your visit. Over the past couple of decades, Bensonhurt has seen a surge in Asian residents, resulting in an Asian-owned store on nearly every block. Supermarkets and laundromats are particularly common, and they're quite popular among local residents due to their high-quality food, reasonable prices, and convenience. Just around where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes' walk of each other, which makes grocery shopping a breeze! I'm not saying Bensonhurt is exclusively Asian, though; it's quite diverse, with immigrants and their first- and second-generation American children living there. Many of the neighborhood's large and popular businesses are Asian-owned. Additionally, there's a recently renovated park nearby with about ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we're in New York City, the parks are diverse. You'll see people of all backgrounds getting along well. In this neighborhood, there aren't many corporate buildings; instead, you'll find co-op living units or condominium apartments. Most residents live in two-family houses. While most people are friendly, it can be quite noisy. Every day, you'll hear cars blasting music as they drive by, and people often rev their engines loudly, which can wake you up in the morning. If you're visiting at night, be cautious. Bensonhurt is generally safe, but individuals can be unpredictable, and you might encounter people looking for trouble, bullies, or thieves. I've personally experienced physical assault in this neighborhood in the past, but that was many years ago. Recently, there have been incidents of package theft, which is relatively common in this neighborhood. Lastly, while New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, many residents don't follow the rules. Every morning, you'll see dog waste on your way to the train station or supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is finding dog waste everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!",
            "I live in a neighborhood that doesn't have many sidewalks. The terrain is hilly, and my house sits at the peak of the steepest hill in the area. Locals call it the \"workout hill\" because it's a popular spot for joggers. Since there are no sidewalks on my street, everyone walks on the road. The road is a bit rough due to potholes and can be hazardous to drive on. Some of the power lines and telephone wires are quite worn out and look a bit grimy. Our region gets a lot of rain and storms, which often lead to branches and debris falling and damaging the lines. The lines are constantly being repaired, giving them a patchwork appearance. There are numerous tall evergreen trees all around, which people often cut down because they block the view of the ocean. Many of the houses are built high up on the hill with large glass fronted second stories to enjoy the bay view. The sunset is breathtaking when the water seems to glow from below and the sky turns orange. Despite the stunning sunsets, it's often cloudy and damp around here. Moss grows on almost everything it can, including roofs, cars, and railings. I left my car parked in the driveway for a month once, and when I returned, it was covered in moss. It took me three hours to clean it off. There aren't many children around, but there's a school nearby. The neighborhood is mostly made up of older residents, many of whom are retired. Instead of kids, there are a lot of dogs. They often sit in people's lawns or race down the street. If you leave a door or window open, you might find one in your living room like I did. Rabbits are common in the area and can be quite large. They're a nuisance for gardeners because they dig up plant roots and burrow into lawns. My cats love to hunt them, and they've managed to get rid of many of them. We also have a variety of birds, from small sparrows and hummingbirds to the occasional hawk or eagle that gets chased off by the neighborhood crows. There aren't any stores nearby, but if you walk downhill to the waterfront, you can find a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach, but the rocks along the shore are fun to toss into the water. The bay isn't very wide, and you can see the opposite shore clearly through the mist most days.",
            "I live in a classic suburban neighborhood in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so our street sees a bit more traffic than I'd prefer, but other than that, it's a peaceful area. Not many people move in and out, so I'm familiar with most of my neighbors. They keep busy with yard work and other daily tasks. In winter, we enjoy sledding down a hill in our street. Since we live at the front corner of our block, we see neighbors coming and going all day, and we're familiar with the cars in the area. We're cautious about new vehicles. Some neighbors go for walks or walk their dogs, and kids play on their bikes. We're mostly at home as we work from our house. Our family consists of myself, my wife, and our two daughters, ages eleven and fourteen. With us constantly coming and going, everyone is used to our presence. We enjoy playing outside, even in the rain. We sometimes grill on our back deck, which always fills the air with a delicious barbecue scent. Lawn mowers run frequently from March until October. We have many trees, originally a wooded area, providing ample shade and a fall leaf cleanup. The smell of burning leaves indicates the arrival of fall. Lately, winter has been mild, extending our fall season. Our garage is at the back of the house, and we rarely use the front door unless someone knocks, which is uncommon. I enjoy working in the garage on my truck or other projects. With the garage doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays are generally quiet, with Thanksgiving and other holidays seeing some families visiting from out of town, adding extra cars to the area. Overall, I appreciate living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be ideal.",
            "My neighborhood is slap bang in the middle of the high desert, where dirt is king and everything is dusty brown. If you haven't experienced it, you can't grasp the sensation of seeing nothing but dirt, and when we do see a lawn, it's clear that the owner is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first moved here in the 90s, the houses were far and wide, but now it's still the same, with plenty of new additions. It feels like the city is growing bigger every day, but I guess that's the way of the world. The people here are generally friendly, and I'm lucky to have some great neighbors, mostly older folks. The stores around here are mostly chains like Food 4 Less, Smart & Final, and the like. If you're looking for something more upmarket, you'll have to travel a bit. The most common jobs here seem to be in construction, probably because the city is still growing and there's plenty of space to build. That's a bit scary for me, as I came from a big city and I'm not looking to move back. I'm a drywall and T-bar installer myself, so I know the job market firsthand. Our home is a wildlife paradise. We have three kids who love chasing lizards and desert bugs. We've adapted to the wildlife here pretty well. As for attractions, Victorville has its charms. The annual San Bernardino County Fair is definitely worth a visit, and you can't miss the snow-covered mountains in Wrightwood for some winter sports. If you're interested in the natural history and culture, the Victor Valley Museum is a must-see. It houses geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of Victorville's development.",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'd say it's a bit unique. Unlike others who might describe their neighborhood as a residential area with homeowners, mine is more akin to a college campus. The people living in my dormitory, along with the surrounding campus, make up my community and neighborhood. Even though it's not typical, my neighborhood has many similar features to a conventional one. We have houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's start with the houses. My neighborhood has three types: apartments, houses, and dormitories. In apartments, there are usually 2-4 people per room, with 4-6 rooms per floor. On average, each building houses about 20 people. Actual houses are rented by those affiliated with the school, usually alumni, and there are a handful scattered around. Dormitories are the most common housing type, with two people per room and hundreds of students living there. Moving on to the people, my school boasts diversity, and that's reflected in my neighborhood. There are staff members living in houses, new students in dorms, and older students in apartments. We have a mix of cultures and ages here. Lastly, there are plenty of stores and a single park. Stores offer usual dining options and our school's unique merchandise. Anything needed can be found within my neighborhood. Our park is a playground for diverse people, kept clean and safe by the community.",
            "Well, given that I've been living here for about a decade, I reckon I can share some insights. Initially, I was awfully bummed when we moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge. It was a rough transition, and I shed a few tears missing my beloved old neighborhood and friends. But my parents wanted the best for me and my sister, so we made the move to a supposedly \"better\" area with better housing and a more reputable high school. Over time, I adjusted and made new acquaintances, some of whom became friends, and others who turned out to be less so. I never really got to know my neighbors extensively, except for Mr. Glen and his family who live right next door, and Dennis, who’s just a stone's throw away. They've been amazing people to me, almost like extended family, and I truly appreciate their kindness. Remembering Mr. Glen’s wedding, where his new wife, Ms. Veda, tossed the wedding bouquet, and I managed to catch the garter but missed the flowers? It was an unforgettable night, and dancing with Marsharii, one of his daughters, was the cherry on top. I haven’t seen Marsharii since, but I hope she's doing well. Our neighborhood is a bit like a labyrinth, but with a GPS now, I've been exploring more. I've hung out with Kason and Curtis in some parts, and we had tons of fun playing video games and enjoying life. Sometimes, I visit the park to find solace in nature, which really calms my soul. I bring along sticks from Home Depot to practice my balance and my bokken wooden sword if I can. I also enjoy using the basketball and tennis courts, although it’s been a while since I’ve played either sport. My dad taught me and my best friend tennis with Mr. Graves back in the day, and we always had a blast. There’s plenty of fun memories here, and I'm excited about what's to come!",
            "My neighborhood is conveniently close to the college that I attend, which makes living here quite pleasant. The area is predominantly apartment buildings, but there are some restaurants and bars that provide a fun atmosphere without breaking the bank. Recently, one of the bars was renamed, and while it's now a bit pricier, the quality of service and drinks remains good. Most of the people I encounter are either college students or lower-income individuals, as the apartment housing is reasonably priced. An elementary school is nearby, and while I don't know my neighbors, they're generally nice. However, they smoke a lot of weed, so the building management installed an air freshener unit near their door, which my boyfriend and I found amusing. The buildings surrounding me are quite old but may have well-renovated interiors. Down the street, there are new apartments, but I'm not fond of them due to poor construction and high rents. There's a restaurant a few minutes away that serves most food on paper plates and uses a microwave, along with a gas station that's not great for employees. Fortunately, the road has been improved with city funding, adding a nice sidewalk and green spaces. My apartment building is surrounded by trees, and while a few were cut down, there are more than those down the road. Behind my complex is a tree line and another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but the buildings on 43rd street are less appealing due to poor sidewalks and rundown buildings. While the trees hide some of the dilapidated structures, there are criminal incidents at the apartment complex on that street. However, I appreciate my neighborhood because it's affordable and offers plenty of useful amenities, such as the university within walking distance and two bus stops for easy access to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood is filled with duplexes on a cul-de-sac, spaced out like individual homes. Each unit is painted yellow, with white porches and green metal roofs, giving it a distinct look. Most residents are friendly, often gathering at the end of the drive, chatting while kids play with toys, chalk, or fly kites. It's a refreshing change from the modern, tech-filled world. We're bordered by fields and trees, with blue skies and billowing clouds. The only downside? This season, we've been under tornado warnings. Last night, we heard the sirens and had to rush to shelter. I found myself in my bathtub, clutching my little dog, purse, and pillows. My bigger dog stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The storm brought hail, and the road literally steamed after the temperature drop. It was like a scene from a movie—from 92°F to 75°F in minutes. The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement. After the storm, the sun came out, revealing a double rainbow. I quickly grabbed my camera and snapped pictures to share. The neighborhood was quiet until some people returned home. Soon, it was back to normal, with moms and children outside, dinner cooking. It's a friendly community, a huge change from my life back in New Hampshire. I live in a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, like everyone else, but not all apartments are the same inside. Some are quite small. I love walking down the big field behind my house and listening to the giant bullfrog in the morning. It's a small-town vibe with roosters crowing and a nearby farm with a donkey. It's a gem of a neighborhood to be found just outside Charlotte.",
            "When I moved to this neighborhood right before eighth grade, it was a bit of a struggle to make friends at first, but eventually I connected with someone living two houses down and another guy on my street. Neither of them live here anymore, but the memories of those friendships remain. The same folks who lived here when I first arrived are still around. My neighborhood is pretty standard for an American suburban area, filled with two-story houses. On warm weekends, you can hear kids playing outside. Most days, it's quiet. I've never had any issues with my neighbors. They're all quite self-sufficient and helpful when needed. I've ordered numerous packages online without any problems, so I feel secure leaving them on my porch. I trust my neighbors implicitly.\n\nThere's a park just a couple of minutes walk from my house, where I've played basketball, football, and baseball with the neighborhood kids. Some of those games ended with bruises, like the time I got elbowed in the nose while playing football, but the good times outweigh the bad. Now, I visit the park to hang out with my cousin's kids, who love the swings and slides. Seeing them enjoy the park brings back a lot of nostalgia for me.\n\nOur neighborhood is quite diverse, with various cuisines nearby. Within a mile radius, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. Nowadays, many people use food delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get their meals, and fast food joints are easy to find in any suburban area. There are also plenty of pizza places around. The stores here carry everything you need, including multiple dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store. There's even an Indian-owned store if you're feeling adventurous with your cooking or just want some ready-made Indian food.\n\nOverall, I'm quite fond of my neighborhood. Reading about the issues others face with their neighbors on social media and the news makes me grateful for mine.",
            "My neighborhood is a charming little town in South Carolina. It's not too different from others, but it has a notable influence on the agricultural industry. Johnston is famously known as the Peach Capital of the World, a title proudly displayed on the welcoming sign. The town is primarily farmland, with peach orchards and cattle pastures taking center stage. Houses, which are usually two-story with either metal or gray shingle roofs, are spaced out, with many located further back to allow for front fields to be used for farming. In the town center, there's a single stop sign at a four-way intersection where you'll find the only stores. There are three places to grab a meal on the go: Hong Kong, a family-owned Chinese restaurant; Fiesta Mexican Restaurant; and Gary's, a small burger place. A pizzeria used to be there, but it closed down recently. There's also a small family pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug, renowned for their Cherry Coca-Cola. The only grocery store is Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, but many residents prefer to shop at a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for most of their groceries. The most popular store is Dollar General, which is always bustling. Across from the furniture store is a pet grooming business called Clark's Cuts and Kennels, offering services like daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and bathing. Both a doctor's office and a vet clinic are located away from town, though they are well-equipped to serve the town's residents. Johnston Elementary School is the only school in the town, with students attending middle and high school in a nearby town after fifth grade. There are no parks, but the town is working on creating a 2.5-acre recreational area to enhance family activities and attract more visitors. Despite the lack of entertainment options like movie theaters, bowling alleys, or hangout spots, Johnston is a pleasant town, small enough to be passed through quickly!",
            "The first time I heard of this place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a bit unexpected. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. None of my friends had heard about it either. Maybe it's the daily grind. A few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night because of the high cost of living. We've all learned to be thrifty over the years. You start to appreciate the smell of vintage toys and secondhand clothes. You don't notice it as much in adulthood. Some of us take up smoking, or we just get used to it. But the flea market is always present. The scent of adulthood lingers in old magazines piled on a closed piano. It sticks to the leather and won't go away, even after you clean. Here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start from the far end, you can visit two charity thrift shops, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling, with cars and people filling the streets every morning, but it's quiet inside the thrift stores. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store remains silent. It's a tranquil place to spend an afternoon. Each year, the city seems to grow busier. Cars and people flood it constantly. It's a developing city, they say. With one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still growing, showing signs of its struggles. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is focused on their own goals, and no one asks much of you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a bit concerned seems like you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here. You can maintain your distance as long as you want, and the city will keep moving like the waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something happening. In a way, I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl, but it's people like my neighbors who make me feel like I haven't completely ruined my life.",
            "The place I call home is your typical cookie cutter suburbia. The most noticeable thing about my neighborhood is the strict presence of a homeowner's association (HOA). The moment you step in, you're greeted by well-maintained single-family homes—all thanks to the HOA's meticulous upkeep. The front yards are all similar, with a small patch of grass, decorative pebbles, and short driveways. Occasionally, you'll spot a small tree. Every house has a two-car garage. As you drive through, you'll notice newly paved concrete roads in pristine condition, with no potholes in sight. Most houses are single-story, though you'll sometimes see two-story ones. Instead of individual mailboxes in front of each house, we have a communal setup at the end of the street, with large groupings of mailboxes and two larger lockers for packages. This uniformity is another attribute of the HOA's influence. My neighborhood is on the outskirts of the nearby city, making it a blend of rural and suburban living. This means we have plenty of land for various activities. We have multiple community pools, walking trails for dog walks or evening strolls, and no need to visit a park for exercise. Most residents are retired, with a small mix of middle-aged and young professionals. The city itself is surprisingly large in population but retains a small-town feel. We have most of the amenities you'd expect—like a single mall that's not huge but gets the job done. It takes about 15 minutes to drive to significant areas, where you'll find a variety of stores, from high-end grocery stores with organic options to bargain outlets with minimal staff. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have great facilities like pools and walking trails, and while we're not next door to major shopping, a quick car ride gets you there.",
            "I reside in a small Midwestern town, just on the outskirts of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, located on the east side, is the town's most economically disadvantaged area. Most houses here are rented out to or owned by low-income individuals. Despite this, it's not an unpleasant place to live. My neighbors are generally friendly folks who greet you with a smile as you walk down the street. While crime rates are slightly higher than other parts of town, they're still manageable. We've seen a few violent incidents here over the past decade, including a shooting and a homicide within a few blocks of my home. Fortunately, our family hasn't been directly impacted by crime. Our close neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. The opioid epidemic has hit this town hard, with many lives lost due to fentanyl overdoses. However, there are resources available to combat this issue, like addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends. Despite these challenges, the town has many positive aspects. My son's elementary school has excellent staff, and he's thriving despite having special needs. The school's positive atmosphere has prevented any bullying. The PTO organizes multiple events to promote family involvement and educational progress. Since over 20% of the town's population lives below the poverty line, the school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students. No child or family is treated as \"less than\" due to financial constraints. School fees, supplies, and field trip costs are affordable. The City Council has made many improvements to the town's appearance, like repaving roads and refurbishing city parks, but most of these improvements have been focused on the center and the west side, where shopping areas are located. The east side, where I live, tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for us. Nevertheless, I enjoy living here. People are friendly, the schools are great, and there are sufficient shopping options. Our home might not be worth much, but it's comfortable and adequate. Our family has been living here for over 16 years, and we can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is a cultural treasure trove, nestled on a hill, encircled by structures steeped in history. I call home a 7-story apartment building, just across the old live theatre, and a block down, there's a charming arcade bar that attracts all sorts of folks on warm summer evenings. On weekends in June and July, you might witness a line of people eager to enter. A few blocks up, lies the nearest city park, quite spacious for its location. Concrete steps surround the park, and during the harsh winter months, homeless individuals set up their tents in neat rows, close together to keep warm. Though it doesn't snow much, torrential rains in mid-winter make it challenging to stay cozy. They're near enough to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I adore about my city isn't the historical architecture, though it's impressive, but the people. Hilltop, once infamous for gang violence, still echoes with tales of the federal government's and DEA's efforts to clean its streets. Despite being one of the rougher 'hoods' in the city, the people here work hard to keep it tidy and still care deeply about their community. However, there's a lingering air of caution, especially for those who are white, to avoid the Hill after dark. I believe this warning is a remnant of the past, flavored with social conditioning. Perhaps my dark enough appearance allows me to blend in or maybe Hilltop perceives me as one of their own, someone acutely aware of the racial, cultural, and fearful assumptions that cloud our society. Regardless of where I roam, Hilltop will always be home. I feel alive walking its streets at night, receiving kindness from strangers more readily than threats. It's a place where laundry owners extend their hours to help out, and even on the greyest nights, someone might stop to offer a $5, complimenting my beauty and value.",
            "I call my home rural America, nestled in small-town Michigan. We transition from expansive farmlands to picturesque tourist cities, where big city conveniences like Walmart, Target, or Applebee’s are hard to find. Everywhere I need to go requires a drive, but I'm lucky to live in one of the most stunning places on Earth, surrounded by water. Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix flank my city, offering beaches for toe-dipping at every turn. My neighborhood encapsulates the essence of small-town living. Houses aren’t cookie-cutter or stacked, but rather older homes, some updated, some with aluminum siding. Most have full basements visible from the road, with yards featuring trampolines, playsets, gardens, and fences for pets. The houses reflect the hardworking people who call this place home, either raising families or having done so. Kids often play outside, and neighbors walk dogs, bike, or rollerblade. Neighbors recognize each other, and the lawns are well-maintained. It's not a neighborhood for show, but a serene, safe haven, perfect for family life. Essential services like the county sheriff’s department, health department, recycling center, baseball fields, and a small-town airport are nearby. You can hear small planes taking off and landing, and kids riding bikes to the park just eight blocks away. It's a great place to call home."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "Living in a large city, my neighborhood is incredibly diverse. Residential areas are scattered among commercial zones, where a variety of businesses operate. Some are massive corporations, others are quaint stores and restaurants, and there are even places for entertainment. The options for food and shopping are endless, with both big-name brands and small boutiques lining the streets and nearby malls. Within walking distance of these lively areas are parks, which are often filled with young families. The people in my neighborhood are incredibly diverse too, ranging from a strong LGBTQ+ and Orthodox Jewish presence to a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Just a short distance away, I find communities of various ethnicities like Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia. However, distances can be deceiving here, with even a 10-mile drive sometimes taking up to two hours due to heavy traffic. Most people in the city commute by car, and parking can be quite a challenge. Ironically, there has been a lot of construction recently, with new apartment buildings popping up everywhere. While it's a popular destination, many residents are wary of the increased population and traffic. Housing options are varied, from single-family homes and duplexes to smaller apartment buildings and condos. And while my neighborhood is diverse, I'm not very familiar with my neighbors, except for a few friends I grew up with. It's not the tight-knit community it once was, but I have fond memories of playing with my neighbors from my childhood.",
            "My neighborhood is a throwback to simpler times. Most homes are single-family dwellings, but a few have been split into two, still sharing a wall. My house has a small front yard and a driveway to the left. It, along with many others, brings back a sense of the suburban American dream that was once vibrant but now seems to be fading. The dream still holds, but the optimism that once fueled it is waning. Keeping up with the yards is a chore, and the once-bustling driveways have fewer cars. Kids still play football, oblivious to the world around them, while the public school, standing tall after nearly a century, inspires dreams in the youth and stirs nostalgic memories in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, often empty, but the basketball courts remain full. Each house looks unique but feels the same, echoing a shared history. A large supermarket, Super \"A,\" has been owned by a Yemeni family, likely the only Arab in the neighborhood. Most residents are African American, with many having been here for generations. They can share stories of a time when everyone knew everyone. There was once a karate school, but it closed when Hollywood stopped making karate movies, replaced by a pharmacy. A discounted movie theater plays old films, favored by the elders who see it as a cheap night out, sans kids. A single expressway runs through our town, but its exit and entrance are in the neighboring town. There was a petition for an exit in our town, supported by the youth and rejected by the elders, who feared it would spoil our town. A new high school is being built, and we're exploring mascots. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin could be a fitting representation of our town.",
            "You might not notice it at first glance - after all, it's a residential area tucked behind a commercial strip. Most people would assume there's no reason to live there, but if you venture behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk past the hotels, which are only occupied annually, you'll find a thriving community. There, you'll see several apartment complexes lined up like Russian nesting dolls that have been carefully taken apart and placed side by side. The first apartments may not look too appealing, but the ones beside and beyond them are another story, a secret world that most locals know nothing about. Across the street is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings where students shuffle in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 a.m. to start their day. The iron gates groan open to let them in, while commuters honk their horns at the traffic delays. The road intersects with another residential street, leading to a park and a rehabilitation center for those who've had unfortunate accidents. The center's cheerful porch furniture and ceiling fan provide relief from the thick summer air. Kids cartwheel and play in the park across the street, while bees lazily buzz around flower patches. Retired folks walk their dogs along the path, grumbling at teenage skaters and nodding politely to the girls hanging out by the playground equipment. A strip mall beside the park boasts an inexpensive sushi restaurant, a swimming supply store, and a nail salon. You could fill your pool, get a manicure, and enjoy hibachi chicken all in one trip. There's also a DIY frozen yogurt shop where teens can be seen on their skateboards, enjoying cold, sweet treats. This neighborhood is a slice of Americana - a timeless piece of history in the quiet south where change is rare, even time itself seems to slow down.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove past the corn fields that stretched as far as the eye could see. \"This is it!\" I exclaimed, knowing she'd be amazed by the vast open spaces. She was from a town where the grocery store was just a five-minute walk from her house—she'd never seen this much open space before. Taken aback by the endless corn fields, I shared what it was like growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she understood who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you'll come across a quarry filled with water. Just past that, you'll reach the small development where I live. The houses here are mostly made of brick and stucco, each with at least half an acre of land that everyone takes great pride in maintaining. During spring, the yards are filled with flowers and midwestern trees that change with the seasons. The driveways are filled with high-end Mercedes-Benz luxury cars that gleam in the midday sun after a good car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside, with a warm smile. He spends his days mowing his lawn, singing over the hum of his mower, and can be heard from far away. Everyone in the neighborhood finds him amusing, but he's always genuine and has a unique history. He used to be a doctor and now blends in with the grass and his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Finally, you'll reach my home. In the side yard, there are abundant geese that our Terrier chases. Out back is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the sound of the stream, and the occasional \"moo\" from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is a hidden oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was where I spent most of my childhood—building tree forts, 'hunting' animals, and making friends in the neighborhood. The winters in my small town can be extremely harsh, but there's no other place as beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green to an empty wilderness, with the trees becoming barren skeletons. When it snows, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is filled with snow angels made by my little sister and snowmen. My sister and I fought a lot as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our favorite weapon. We'd build massive igloo-like forts to house our arsenal, using branches. In our own little wonderland, we played pretend, lost in a world where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids, carefree and innocent.",
            "The first thing you need to understand about Portland, Oregon is that it's the literal definition of \"weird\". The town's unofficial motto, proudly displayed on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, and, let's just say, a certain type of establishment that skirts the law, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, it's a call to remember the Portland of the 90s and early 2000s, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, fostering unique and creative subcultures. To others, it's a welcoming sign, encouraging you to come to Portland where being weird is actually a compliment. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the constant construction of condos for them, Portland remains weird. Weird doesn't mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that aren't typically accepted. Weird doesn't mean we don't have modern amenities or modern problems. We buy most of our stuff from China, just like everywhere else. There's a million ways to be weird, to not be normal, but Portland is full of normal too. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird just means we take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, like many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers, herbs, and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are basically cardboard boxes filled with stuff someone's getting rid of, but they can also be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a perfect treasure for the person wandering by, surprisingly often. They usually have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about, at least in my opinion. There are countless varieties of weirdness in Portland. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. They'd rather go to goat yoga (yep, yoga with real goats) or Timbers matches (Portland's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. It's full of people who pursue their dreams, or at least dream about pursuing their dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems are often rooted in mental health issues, and the constant rain and gloomy skies don't help. Portland also has a homelessness problem, which is a challenge. The homeless population is drawn by Portland's social services, which are better than most, but our services are insufficient, just like everywhere else. The non-homeless population oscillates between care and hatred. In this, Portland is not weird at all.",
            "The mountains are always present, steadfast and unyielding, standing sentinel in the north. They greet the sun's journey every morning and evening, unperturbed by the ebb and flow of life. When life's pressures overwhelm me, the mountains remind me to seek solace in their grandeur. I first encountered them when I started my undergrad; they've been a constant companion since. While the university boasts its own stunning landscapes, the mountains hold a special place in my heart. The town itself is a blend of bustling urban energy and serene suburban charm. Its cafés have been the backdrop to countless study sessions fueled by caffeine. A short bus ride or walk takes you to the downtown area, where vintage brick buildings and lively eateries create an atmosphere of vibrancy. This urban energy fades into quiet residential neighborhoods near the library, offering a stark contrast and an invitation to explore. The town is a treasure trove of cherished memories, from late-night chats with friends by the park to movie nights at the university's fancy theater. Yet, it's also remembered for more somber moments, such as late-night reflections by the pond. While watching the pond's inhabitants go about their lives, I've often pondered my own purpose. The mountains, ever-present, have been there to remind me of my resilience. As I walked to a main street, the sun painted the sky with brilliant hues, and I realized I was heading north, towards the mountains. There they were, towering and steadfast, their peaks reaching for the sky. They stirred within me a sense of perseverance, a reminder to keep moving forward, one day at a time.",
            "If you plan on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you won't have any trouble locating it! Public transportation is incredibly accessible and is one of the most popular ways to get around in New York City. Bensonhurt is an urban neighborhood, so you'll still feel like you're in the heart of the city. Expect to see numerous Asian stores during your visit. Over the past couple of decades, Bensonhurt has seen a surge in Asian residents, resulting in an Asian-owned store on nearly every block. Supermarkets and laundromats are particularly common, and they're quite popular among local residents due to their high-quality food, reasonable prices, and convenience. Just around where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes' walk of each other, which makes grocery shopping a breeze! I'm not saying Bensonhurt is exclusively Asian, though; it's quite diverse, with immigrants and their first- and second-generation American children living there. Many of the neighborhood's large and popular businesses are Asian-owned. Additionally, there's a recently renovated park nearby with about ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we're in New York City, the parks are diverse. You'll see people of all backgrounds getting along well. In this neighborhood, there aren't many corporate buildings; instead, you'll find co-op living units or condominium apartments. Most residents live in two-family houses. While most people are friendly, it can be quite noisy. Every day, you'll hear cars blasting music as they drive by, and people often rev their engines loudly, which can wake you up in the morning. If you're visiting at night, be cautious. Bensonhurt is generally safe, but individuals can be unpredictable, and you might encounter people looking for trouble, bullies, or thieves. I've personally experienced physical assault in this neighborhood in the past, but that was many years ago. Recently, there have been incidents of package theft, which is relatively common in this neighborhood. Lastly, while New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, many residents don't follow the rules. Every morning, you'll see dog waste on your way to the train station or supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is finding dog waste everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!",
            "I live in a neighborhood that doesn't have many sidewalks. The terrain is hilly, and my house sits at the peak of the steepest hill in the area. Locals call it the \"workout hill\" because it's a popular spot for joggers. Since there are no sidewalks on my street, everyone walks on the road. The road is a bit rough due to potholes and can be hazardous to drive on. Some of the power lines and telephone wires are quite worn out and look a bit grimy. Our region gets a lot of rain and storms, which often lead to branches and debris falling and damaging the lines. The lines are constantly being repaired, giving them a patchwork appearance. There are numerous tall evergreen trees all around, which people often cut down because they block the view of the ocean. Many of the houses are built high up on the hill with large glass fronted second stories to enjoy the bay view. The sunset is breathtaking when the water seems to glow from below and the sky turns orange. Despite the stunning sunsets, it's often cloudy and damp around here. Moss grows on almost everything it can, including roofs, cars, and railings. I left my car parked in the driveway for a month once, and when I returned, it was covered in moss. It took me three hours to clean it off. There aren't many children around, but there's a school nearby. The neighborhood is mostly made up of older residents, many of whom are retired. Instead of kids, there are a lot of dogs. They often sit in people's lawns or race down the street. If you leave a door or window open, you might find one in your living room like I did. Rabbits are common in the area and can be quite large. They're a nuisance for gardeners because they dig up plant roots and burrow into lawns. My cats love to hunt them, and they've managed to get rid of many of them. We also have a variety of birds, from small sparrows and hummingbirds to the occasional hawk or eagle that gets chased off by the neighborhood crows. There aren't any stores nearby, but if you walk downhill to the waterfront, you can find a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach, but the rocks along the shore are fun to toss into the water. The bay isn't very wide, and you can see the opposite shore clearly through the mist most days.",
            "I live in a classic suburban neighborhood in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so our street sees a bit more traffic than I'd prefer, but other than that, it's a peaceful area. Not many people move in and out, so I'm familiar with most of my neighbors. They keep busy with yard work and other daily tasks. In winter, we enjoy sledding down a hill in our street. Since we live at the front corner of our block, we see neighbors coming and going all day, and we're familiar with the cars in the area. We're cautious about new vehicles. Some neighbors go for walks or walk their dogs, and kids play on their bikes. We're mostly at home as we work from our house. Our family consists of myself, my wife, and our two daughters, ages eleven and fourteen. With us constantly coming and going, everyone is used to our presence. We enjoy playing outside, even in the rain. We sometimes grill on our back deck, which always fills the air with a delicious barbecue scent. Lawn mowers run frequently from March until October. We have many trees, originally a wooded area, providing ample shade and a fall leaf cleanup. The smell of burning leaves indicates the arrival of fall. Lately, winter has been mild, extending our fall season. Our garage is at the back of the house, and we rarely use the front door unless someone knocks, which is uncommon. I enjoy working in the garage on my truck or other projects. With the garage doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays are generally quiet, with Thanksgiving and other holidays seeing some families visiting from out of town, adding extra cars to the area. Overall, I appreciate living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be ideal.",
            "My neighborhood is slap bang in the middle of the high desert, where dirt is king and everything is dusty brown. If you haven't experienced it, you can't grasp the sensation of seeing nothing but dirt, and when we do see a lawn, it's clear that the owner is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first moved here in the 90s, the houses were far and wide, but now it's still the same, with plenty of new additions. It feels like the city is growing bigger every day, but I guess that's the way of the world. The people here are generally friendly, and I'm lucky to have some great neighbors, mostly older folks. The stores around here are mostly chains like Food 4 Less, Smart & Final, and the like. If you're looking for something more upmarket, you'll have to travel a bit. The most common jobs here seem to be in construction, probably because the city is still growing and there's plenty of space to build. That's a bit scary for me, as I came from a big city and I'm not looking to move back. I'm a drywall and T-bar installer myself, so I know the job market firsthand. Our home is a wildlife paradise. We have three kids who love chasing lizards and desert bugs. We've adapted to the wildlife here pretty well. As for attractions, Victorville has its charms. The annual San Bernardino County Fair is definitely worth a visit, and you can't miss the snow-covered mountains in Wrightwood for some winter sports. If you're interested in the natural history and culture, the Victor Valley Museum is a must-see. It houses geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of Victorville's development.",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'd say it's a bit unique. Unlike others who might describe their neighborhood as a residential area with homeowners, mine is more akin to a college campus. The people living in my dormitory, along with the surrounding campus, make up my community and neighborhood. Even though it's not typical, my neighborhood has many similar features to a conventional one. We have houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's start with the houses. My neighborhood has three types: apartments, houses, and dormitories. In apartments, there are usually 2-4 people per room, with 4-6 rooms per floor. On average, each building houses about 20 people. Actual houses are rented by those affiliated with the school, usually alumni, and there are a handful scattered around. Dormitories are the most common housing type, with two people per room and hundreds of students living there. Moving on to the people, my school boasts diversity, and that's reflected in my neighborhood. There are staff members living in houses, new students in dorms, and older students in apartments. We have a mix of cultures and ages here. Lastly, there are plenty of stores and a single park. Stores offer usual dining options and our school's unique merchandise. Anything needed can be found within my neighborhood. Our park is a playground for diverse people, kept clean and safe by the community.",
            "Well, given that I've been living here for about a decade, I reckon I can share some insights. Initially, I was awfully bummed when we moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge. It was a rough transition, and I shed a few tears missing my beloved old neighborhood and friends. But my parents wanted the best for me and my sister, so we made the move to a supposedly \"better\" area with better housing and a more reputable high school. Over time, I adjusted and made new acquaintances, some of whom became friends, and others who turned out to be less so. I never really got to know my neighbors extensively, except for Mr. Glen and his family who live right next door, and Dennis, who’s just a stone's throw away. They've been amazing people to me, almost like extended family, and I truly appreciate their kindness. Remembering Mr. Glen’s wedding, where his new wife, Ms. Veda, tossed the wedding bouquet, and I managed to catch the garter but missed the flowers? It was an unforgettable night, and dancing with Marsharii, one of his daughters, was the cherry on top. I haven’t seen Marsharii since, but I hope she's doing well. Our neighborhood is a bit like a labyrinth, but with a GPS now, I've been exploring more. I've hung out with Kason and Curtis in some parts, and we had tons of fun playing video games and enjoying life. Sometimes, I visit the park to find solace in nature, which really calms my soul. I bring along sticks from Home Depot to practice my balance and my bokken wooden sword if I can. I also enjoy using the basketball and tennis courts, although it’s been a while since I’ve played either sport. My dad taught me and my best friend tennis with Mr. Graves back in the day, and we always had a blast. There’s plenty of fun memories here, and I'm excited about what's to come!",
            "My neighborhood is conveniently close to the college that I attend, which makes living here quite pleasant. The area is predominantly apartment buildings, but there are some restaurants and bars that provide a fun atmosphere without breaking the bank. Recently, one of the bars was renamed, and while it's now a bit pricier, the quality of service and drinks remains good. Most of the people I encounter are either college students or lower-income individuals, as the apartment housing is reasonably priced. An elementary school is nearby, and while I don't know my neighbors, they're generally nice. However, they smoke a lot of weed, so the building management installed an air freshener unit near their door, which my boyfriend and I found amusing. The buildings surrounding me are quite old but may have well-renovated interiors. Down the street, there are new apartments, but I'm not fond of them due to poor construction and high rents. There's a restaurant a few minutes away that serves most food on paper plates and uses a microwave, along with a gas station that's not great for employees. Fortunately, the road has been improved with city funding, adding a nice sidewalk and green spaces. My apartment building is surrounded by trees, and while a few were cut down, there are more than those down the road. Behind my complex is a tree line and another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but the buildings on 43rd street are less appealing due to poor sidewalks and rundown buildings. While the trees hide some of the dilapidated structures, there are criminal incidents at the apartment complex on that street. However, I appreciate my neighborhood because it's affordable and offers plenty of useful amenities, such as the university within walking distance and two bus stops for easy access to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood is filled with duplexes on a cul-de-sac, spaced out like individual homes. Each unit is painted yellow, with white porches and green metal roofs, giving it a distinct look. Most residents are friendly, often gathering at the end of the drive, chatting while kids play with toys, chalk, or fly kites. It's a refreshing change from the modern, tech-filled world. We're bordered by fields and trees, with blue skies and billowing clouds. The only downside? This season, we've been under tornado warnings. Last night, we heard the sirens and had to rush to shelter. I found myself in my bathtub, clutching my little dog, purse, and pillows. My bigger dog stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The storm brought hail, and the road literally steamed after the temperature drop. It was like a scene from a movie—from 92°F to 75°F in minutes. The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement. After the storm, the sun came out, revealing a double rainbow. I quickly grabbed my camera and snapped pictures to share. The neighborhood was quiet until some people returned home. Soon, it was back to normal, with moms and children outside, dinner cooking. It's a friendly community, a huge change from my life back in New Hampshire. I live in a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, like everyone else, but not all apartments are the same inside. Some are quite small. I love walking down the big field behind my house and listening to the giant bullfrog in the morning. It's a small-town vibe with roosters crowing and a nearby farm with a donkey. It's a gem of a neighborhood to be found just outside Charlotte.",
            "When I moved to this neighborhood right before eighth grade, it was a bit of a struggle to make friends at first, but eventually I connected with someone living two houses down and another guy on my street. Neither of them live here anymore, but the memories of those friendships remain. The same folks who lived here when I first arrived are still around. My neighborhood is pretty standard for an American suburban area, filled with two-story houses. On warm weekends, you can hear kids playing outside. Most days, it's quiet. I've never had any issues with my neighbors. They're all quite self-sufficient and helpful when needed. I've ordered numerous packages online without any problems, so I feel secure leaving them on my porch. I trust my neighbors implicitly.\n\nThere's a park just a couple of minutes walk from my house, where I've played basketball, football, and baseball with the neighborhood kids. Some of those games ended with bruises, like the time I got elbowed in the nose while playing football, but the good times outweigh the bad. Now, I visit the park to hang out with my cousin's kids, who love the swings and slides. Seeing them enjoy the park brings back a lot of nostalgia for me.\n\nOur neighborhood is quite diverse, with various cuisines nearby. Within a mile radius, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. Nowadays, many people use food delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get their meals, and fast food joints are easy to find in any suburban area. There are also plenty of pizza places around. The stores here carry everything you need, including multiple dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store. There's even an Indian-owned store if you're feeling adventurous with your cooking or just want some ready-made Indian food.\n\nOverall, I'm quite fond of my neighborhood. Reading about the issues others face with their neighbors on social media and the news makes me grateful for mine.",
            "My neighborhood is a charming little town in South Carolina. It's not too different from others, but it has a notable influence on the agricultural industry. Johnston is famously known as the Peach Capital of the World, a title proudly displayed on the welcoming sign. The town is primarily farmland, with peach orchards and cattle pastures taking center stage. Houses, which are usually two-story with either metal or gray shingle roofs, are spaced out, with many located further back to allow for front fields to be used for farming. In the town center, there's a single stop sign at a four-way intersection where you'll find the only stores. There are three places to grab a meal on the go: Hong Kong, a family-owned Chinese restaurant; Fiesta Mexican Restaurant; and Gary's, a small burger place. A pizzeria used to be there, but it closed down recently. There's also a small family pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug, renowned for their Cherry Coca-Cola. The only grocery store is Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, but many residents prefer to shop at a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for most of their groceries. The most popular store is Dollar General, which is always bustling. Across from the furniture store is a pet grooming business called Clark's Cuts and Kennels, offering services like daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and bathing. Both a doctor's office and a vet clinic are located away from town, though they are well-equipped to serve the town's residents. Johnston Elementary School is the only school in the town, with students attending middle and high school in a nearby town after fifth grade. There are no parks, but the town is working on creating a 2.5-acre recreational area to enhance family activities and attract more visitors. Despite the lack of entertainment options like movie theaters, bowling alleys, or hangout spots, Johnston is a pleasant town, small enough to be passed through quickly!",
            "The first time I heard of this place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a bit unexpected. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. None of my friends had heard about it either. Maybe it's the daily grind. A few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night because of the high cost of living. We've all learned to be thrifty over the years. You start to appreciate the smell of vintage toys and secondhand clothes. You don't notice it as much in adulthood. Some of us take up smoking, or we just get used to it. But the flea market is always present. The scent of adulthood lingers in old magazines piled on a closed piano. It sticks to the leather and won't go away, even after you clean. Here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start from the far end, you can visit two charity thrift shops, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling, with cars and people filling the streets every morning, but it's quiet inside the thrift stores. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store remains silent. It's a tranquil place to spend an afternoon. Each year, the city seems to grow busier. Cars and people flood it constantly. It's a developing city, they say. With one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still growing, showing signs of its struggles. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is focused on their own goals, and no one asks much of you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a bit concerned seems like you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here. You can maintain your distance as long as you want, and the city will keep moving like the waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something happening. In a way, I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl, but it's people like my neighbors who make me feel like I haven't completely ruined my life.",
            "The place I call home is your typical cookie cutter suburbia. The most noticeable thing about my neighborhood is the strict presence of a homeowner's association (HOA). The moment you step in, you're greeted by well-maintained single-family homes—all thanks to the HOA's meticulous upkeep. The front yards are all similar, with a small patch of grass, decorative pebbles, and short driveways. Occasionally, you'll spot a small tree. Every house has a two-car garage. As you drive through, you'll notice newly paved concrete roads in pristine condition, with no potholes in sight. Most houses are single-story, though you'll sometimes see two-story ones. Instead of individual mailboxes in front of each house, we have a communal setup at the end of the street, with large groupings of mailboxes and two larger lockers for packages. This uniformity is another attribute of the HOA's influence. My neighborhood is on the outskirts of the nearby city, making it a blend of rural and suburban living. This means we have plenty of land for various activities. We have multiple community pools, walking trails for dog walks or evening strolls, and no need to visit a park for exercise. Most residents are retired, with a small mix of middle-aged and young professionals. The city itself is surprisingly large in population but retains a small-town feel. We have most of the amenities you'd expect—like a single mall that's not huge but gets the job done. It takes about 15 minutes to drive to significant areas, where you'll find a variety of stores, from high-end grocery stores with organic options to bargain outlets with minimal staff. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have great facilities like pools and walking trails, and while we're not next door to major shopping, a quick car ride gets you there.",
            "I reside in a small Midwestern town, just on the outskirts of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, located on the east side, is the town's most economically disadvantaged area. Most houses here are rented out to or owned by low-income individuals. Despite this, it's not an unpleasant place to live. My neighbors are generally friendly folks who greet you with a smile as you walk down the street. While crime rates are slightly higher than other parts of town, they're still manageable. We've seen a few violent incidents here over the past decade, including a shooting and a homicide within a few blocks of my home. Fortunately, our family hasn't been directly impacted by crime. Our close neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. The opioid epidemic has hit this town hard, with many lives lost due to fentanyl overdoses. However, there are resources available to combat this issue, like addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends. Despite these challenges, the town has many positive aspects. My son's elementary school has excellent staff, and he's thriving despite having special needs. The school's positive atmosphere has prevented any bullying. The PTO organizes multiple events to promote family involvement and educational progress. Since over 20% of the town's population lives below the poverty line, the school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students. No child or family is treated as \"less than\" due to financial constraints. School fees, supplies, and field trip costs are affordable. The City Council has made many improvements to the town's appearance, like repaving roads and refurbishing city parks, but most of these improvements have been focused on the center and the west side, where shopping areas are located. The east side, where I live, tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for us. Nevertheless, I enjoy living here. People are friendly, the schools are great, and there are sufficient shopping options. Our home might not be worth much, but it's comfortable and adequate. Our family has been living here for over 16 years, and we can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is a cultural treasure trove, nestled on a hill, encircled by structures steeped in history. I call home a 7-story apartment building, just across the old live theatre, and a block down, there's a charming arcade bar that attracts all sorts of folks on warm summer evenings. On weekends in June and July, you might witness a line of people eager to enter. A few blocks up, lies the nearest city park, quite spacious for its location. Concrete steps surround the park, and during the harsh winter months, homeless individuals set up their tents in neat rows, close together to keep warm. Though it doesn't snow much, torrential rains in mid-winter make it challenging to stay cozy. They're near enough to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I adore about my city isn't the historical architecture, though it's impressive, but the people. Hilltop, once infamous for gang violence, still echoes with tales of the federal government's and DEA's efforts to clean its streets. Despite being one of the rougher 'hoods' in the city, the people here work hard to keep it tidy and still care deeply about their community. However, there's a lingering air of caution, especially for those who are white, to avoid the Hill after dark. I believe this warning is a remnant of the past, flavored with social conditioning. Perhaps my dark enough appearance allows me to blend in or maybe Hilltop perceives me as one of their own, someone acutely aware of the racial, cultural, and fearful assumptions that cloud our society. Regardless of where I roam, Hilltop will always be home. I feel alive walking its streets at night, receiving kindness from strangers more readily than threats. It's a place where laundry owners extend their hours to help out, and even on the greyest nights, someone might stop to offer a $5, complimenting my beauty and value.",
            "I call my home rural America, nestled in small-town Michigan. We transition from expansive farmlands to picturesque tourist cities, where big city conveniences like Walmart, Target, or Applebee’s are hard to find. Everywhere I need to go requires a drive, but I'm lucky to live in one of the most stunning places on Earth, surrounded by water. Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix flank my city, offering beaches for toe-dipping at every turn. My neighborhood encapsulates the essence of small-town living. Houses aren’t cookie-cutter or stacked, but rather older homes, some updated, some with aluminum siding. Most have full basements visible from the road, with yards featuring trampolines, playsets, gardens, and fences for pets. The houses reflect the hardworking people who call this place home, either raising families or having done so. Kids often play outside, and neighbors walk dogs, bike, or rollerblade. Neighbors recognize each other, and the lawns are well-maintained. It's not a neighborhood for show, but a serene, safe haven, perfect for family life. Essential services like the county sheriff’s department, health department, recycling center, baseball fields, and a small-town airport are nearby. You can hear small planes taking off and landing, and kids riding bikes to the park just eight blocks away. It's a great place to call home."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "Living in a large city, my neighborhood is incredibly diverse. Residential areas are scattered among commercial zones, where a variety of businesses operate. Some are massive corporations, others are quaint stores and restaurants, and there are even places for entertainment. The options for food and shopping are endless, with both big-name brands and small boutiques lining the streets and nearby malls. Within walking distance of these lively areas are parks, which are often filled with young families. The people in my neighborhood are incredibly diverse too, ranging from a strong LGBTQ+ and Orthodox Jewish presence to a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Just a short distance away, I find communities of various ethnicities like Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia. However, distances can be deceiving here, with even a 10-mile drive sometimes taking up to two hours due to heavy traffic. Most people in the city commute by car, and parking can be quite a challenge. Ironically, there has been a lot of construction recently, with new apartment buildings popping up everywhere. While it's a popular destination, many residents are wary of the increased population and traffic. Housing options are varied, from single-family homes and duplexes to smaller apartment buildings and condos. And while my neighborhood is diverse, I'm not very familiar with my neighbors, except for a few friends I grew up with. It's not the tight-knit community it once was, but I have fond memories of playing with my neighbors from my childhood.",
            "My neighborhood is a throwback to simpler times. Most homes are single-family dwellings, but a few have been split into two, still sharing a wall. My house has a small front yard and a driveway to the left. It, along with many others, brings back a sense of the suburban American dream that was once vibrant but now seems to be fading. The dream still holds, but the optimism that once fueled it is waning. Keeping up with the yards is a chore, and the once-bustling driveways have fewer cars. Kids still play football, oblivious to the world around them, while the public school, standing tall after nearly a century, inspires dreams in the youth and stirs nostalgic memories in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, often empty, but the basketball courts remain full. Each house looks unique but feels the same, echoing a shared history. A large supermarket, Super \"A,\" has been owned by a Yemeni family, likely the only Arab in the neighborhood. Most residents are African American, with many having been here for generations. They can share stories of a time when everyone knew everyone. There was once a karate school, but it closed when Hollywood stopped making karate movies, replaced by a pharmacy. A discounted movie theater plays old films, favored by the elders who see it as a cheap night out, sans kids. A single expressway runs through our town, but its exit and entrance are in the neighboring town. There was a petition for an exit in our town, supported by the youth and rejected by the elders, who feared it would spoil our town. A new high school is being built, and we're exploring mascots. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin could be a fitting representation of our town.",
            "You might not notice it at first glance - after all, it's a residential area tucked behind a commercial strip. Most people would assume there's no reason to live there, but if you venture behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk past the hotels, which are only occupied annually, you'll find a thriving community. There, you'll see several apartment complexes lined up like Russian nesting dolls that have been carefully taken apart and placed side by side. The first apartments may not look too appealing, but the ones beside and beyond them are another story, a secret world that most locals know nothing about. Across the street is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings where students shuffle in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 a.m. to start their day. The iron gates groan open to let them in, while commuters honk their horns at the traffic delays. The road intersects with another residential street, leading to a park and a rehabilitation center for those who've had unfortunate accidents. The center's cheerful porch furniture and ceiling fan provide relief from the thick summer air. Kids cartwheel and play in the park across the street, while bees lazily buzz around flower patches. Retired folks walk their dogs along the path, grumbling at teenage skaters and nodding politely to the girls hanging out by the playground equipment. A strip mall beside the park boasts an inexpensive sushi restaurant, a swimming supply store, and a nail salon. You could fill your pool, get a manicure, and enjoy hibachi chicken all in one trip. There's also a DIY frozen yogurt shop where teens can be seen on their skateboards, enjoying cold, sweet treats. This neighborhood is a slice of Americana - a timeless piece of history in the quiet south where change is rare, even time itself seems to slow down.",

            "The first thing you need to understand about Portland, Oregon is that it's the literal definition of \"weird\". The town's unofficial motto, proudly displayed on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, and, let's just say, a certain type of establishment that skirts the law, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, it's a call to remember the Portland of the 90s and early 2000s, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, fostering unique and creative subcultures. To others, it's a welcoming sign, encouraging you to come to Portland where being weird is actually a compliment. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the constant construction of condos for them, Portland remains weird. Weird doesn't mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that aren't typically accepted. Weird doesn't mean we don't have modern amenities or modern problems. We buy most of our stuff from China, just like everywhere else. There's a million ways to be weird, to not be normal, but Portland is full of normal too. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird just means we take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, like many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers, herbs, and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are basically cardboard boxes filled with stuff someone's getting rid of, but they can also be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a perfect treasure for the person wandering by, surprisingly often. They usually have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about, at least in my opinion. There are countless varieties of weirdness in Portland. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. They'd rather go to goat yoga (yep, yoga with real goats) or Timbers matches (Portland's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. It's full of people who pursue their dreams, or at least dream about pursuing their dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems are often rooted in mental health issues, and the constant rain and gloomy skies don't help. Portland also has a homelessness problem, which is a challenge. The homeless population is drawn by Portland's social services, which are better than most, but our services are insufficient, just like everywhere else. The non-homeless population oscillates between care and hatred. In this, Portland is not weird at all.",
            "The mountains are always present, steadfast and unyielding, standing sentinel in the north. They greet the sun's journey every morning and evening, unperturbed by the ebb and flow of life. When life's pressures overwhelm me, the mountains remind me to seek solace in their grandeur. I first encountered them when I started my undergrad; they've been a constant companion since. While the university boasts its own stunning landscapes, the mountains hold a special place in my heart. The town itself is a blend of bustling urban energy and serene suburban charm. Its cafés have been the backdrop to countless study sessions fueled by caffeine. A short bus ride or walk takes you to the downtown area, where vintage brick buildings and lively eateries create an atmosphere of vibrancy. This urban energy fades into quiet residential neighborhoods near the library, offering a stark contrast and an invitation to explore. The town is a treasure trove of cherished memories, from late-night chats with friends by the park to movie nights at the university's fancy theater. Yet, it's also remembered for more somber moments, such as late-night reflections by the pond. While watching the pond's inhabitants go about their lives, I've often pondered my own purpose. The mountains, ever-present, have been there to remind me of my resilience. As I walked to a main street, the sun painted the sky with brilliant hues, and I realized I was heading north, towards the mountains. There they were, towering and steadfast, their peaks reaching for the sky. They stirred within me a sense of perseverance, a reminder to keep moving forward, one day at a time.",
            "If you plan on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you won't have any trouble locating it! Public transportation is incredibly accessible and is one of the most popular ways to get around in New York City. Bensonhurt is an urban neighborhood, so you'll still feel like you're in the heart of the city. Expect to see numerous Asian stores during your visit. Over the past couple of decades, Bensonhurt has seen a surge in Asian residents, resulting in an Asian-owned store on nearly every block. Supermarkets and laundromats are particularly common, and they're quite popular among local residents due to their high-quality food, reasonable prices, and convenience. Just around where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes' walk of each other, which makes grocery shopping a breeze! I'm not saying Bensonhurt is exclusively Asian, though; it's quite diverse, with immigrants and their first- and second-generation American children living there. Many of the neighborhood's large and popular businesses are Asian-owned. Additionally, there's a recently renovated park nearby with about ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we're in New York City, the parks are diverse. You'll see people of all backgrounds getting along well. In this neighborhood, there aren't many corporate buildings; instead, you'll find co-op living units or condominium apartments. Most residents live in two-family houses. While most people are friendly, it can be quite noisy. Every day, you'll hear cars blasting music as they drive by, and people often rev their engines loudly, which can wake you up in the morning. If you're visiting at night, be cautious. Bensonhurt is generally safe, but individuals can be unpredictable, and you might encounter people looking for trouble, bullies, or thieves. I've personally experienced physical assault in this neighborhood in the past, but that was many years ago. Recently, there have been incidents of package theft, which is relatively common in this neighborhood. Lastly, while New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, many residents don't follow the rules. Every morning, you'll see dog waste on your way to the train station or supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is finding dog waste everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!",
            "I live in a neighborhood that doesn't have many sidewalks. The terrain is hilly, and my house sits at the peak of the steepest hill in the area. Locals call it the \"workout hill\" because it's a popular spot for joggers. Since there are no sidewalks on my street, everyone walks on the road. The road is a bit rough due to potholes and can be hazardous to drive on. Some of the power lines and telephone wires are quite worn out and look a bit grimy. Our region gets a lot of rain and storms, which often lead to branches and debris falling and damaging the lines. The lines are constantly being repaired, giving them a patchwork appearance. There are numerous tall evergreen trees all around, which people often cut down because they block the view of the ocean. Many of the houses are built high up on the hill with large glass fronted second stories to enjoy the bay view. The sunset is breathtaking when the water seems to glow from below and the sky turns orange. Despite the stunning sunsets, it's often cloudy and damp around here. Moss grows on almost everything it can, including roofs, cars, and railings. I left my car parked in the driveway for a month once, and when I returned, it was covered in moss. It took me three hours to clean it off. There aren't many children around, but there's a school nearby. The neighborhood is mostly made up of older residents, many of whom are retired. Instead of kids, there are a lot of dogs. They often sit in people's lawns or race down the street. If you leave a door or window open, you might find one in your living room like I did. Rabbits are common in the area and can be quite large. They're a nuisance for gardeners because they dig up plant roots and burrow into lawns. My cats love to hunt them, and they've managed to get rid of many of them. We also have a variety of birds, from small sparrows and hummingbirds to the occasional hawk or eagle that gets chased off by the neighborhood crows. There aren't any stores nearby, but if you walk downhill to the waterfront, you can find a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach, but the rocks along the shore are fun to toss into the water. The bay isn't very wide, and you can see the opposite shore clearly through the mist most days.",
            "I live in a classic suburban neighborhood in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so our street sees a bit more traffic than I'd prefer, but other than that, it's a peaceful area. Not many people move in and out, so I'm familiar with most of my neighbors. They keep busy with yard work and other daily tasks. In winter, we enjoy sledding down a hill in our street. Since we live at the front corner of our block, we see neighbors coming and going all day, and we're familiar with the cars in the area. We're cautious about new vehicles. Some neighbors go for walks or walk their dogs, and kids play on their bikes. We're mostly at home as we work from our house. Our family consists of myself, my wife, and our two daughters, ages eleven and fourteen. With us constantly coming and going, everyone is used to our presence. We enjoy playing outside, even in the rain. We sometimes grill on our back deck, which always fills the air with a delicious barbecue scent. Lawn mowers run frequently from March until October. We have many trees, originally a wooded area, providing ample shade and a fall leaf cleanup. The smell of burning leaves indicates the arrival of fall. Lately, winter has been mild, extending our fall season. Our garage is at the back of the house, and we rarely use the front door unless someone knocks, which is uncommon. I enjoy working in the garage on my truck or other projects. With the garage doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays are generally quiet, with Thanksgiving and other holidays seeing some families visiting from out of town, adding extra cars to the area. Overall, I appreciate living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be ideal.",
            "My neighborhood is slap bang in the middle of the high desert, where dirt is king and everything is dusty brown. If you haven't experienced it, you can't grasp the sensation of seeing nothing but dirt, and when we do see a lawn, it's clear that the owner is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first moved here in the 90s, the houses were far and wide, but now it's still the same, with plenty of new additions. It feels like the city is growing bigger every day, but I guess that's the way of the world. The people here are generally friendly, and I'm lucky to have some great neighbors, mostly older folks. The stores around here are mostly chains like Food 4 Less, Smart & Final, and the like. If you're looking for something more upmarket, you'll have to travel a bit. The most common jobs here seem to be in construction, probably because the city is still growing and there's plenty of space to build. That's a bit scary for me, as I came from a big city and I'm not looking to move back. I'm a drywall and T-bar installer myself, so I know the job market firsthand. Our home is a wildlife paradise. We have three kids who love chasing lizards and desert bugs. We've adapted to the wildlife here pretty well. As for attractions, Victorville has its charms. The annual San Bernardino County Fair is definitely worth a visit, and you can't miss the snow-covered mountains in Wrightwood for some winter sports. If you're interested in the natural history and culture, the Victor Valley Museum is a must-see. It houses geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of Victorville's development.",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'd say it's a bit unique. Unlike others who might describe their neighborhood as a residential area with homeowners, mine is more akin to a college campus. The people living in my dormitory, along with the surrounding campus, make up my community and neighborhood. Even though it's not typical, my neighborhood has many similar features to a conventional one. We have houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's start with the houses. My neighborhood has three types: apartments, houses, and dormitories. In apartments, there are usually 2-4 people per room, with 4-6 rooms per floor. On average, each building houses about 20 people. Actual houses are rented by those affiliated with the school, usually alumni, and there are a handful scattered around. Dormitories are the most common housing type, with two people per room and hundreds of students living there. Moving on to the people, my school boasts diversity, and that's reflected in my neighborhood. There are staff members living in houses, new students in dorms, and older students in apartments. We have a mix of cultures and ages here. Lastly, there are plenty of stores and a single park. Stores offer usual dining options and our school's unique merchandise. Anything needed can be found within my neighborhood. Our park is a playground for diverse people, kept clean and safe by the community.",
            "Well, given that I've been living here for about a decade, I reckon I can share some insights. Initially, I was awfully bummed when we moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge. It was a rough transition, and I shed a few tears missing my beloved old neighborhood and friends. But my parents wanted the best for me and my sister, so we made the move to a supposedly \"better\" area with better housing and a more reputable high school. Over time, I adjusted and made new acquaintances, some of whom became friends, and others who turned out to be less so. I never really got to know my neighbors extensively, except for Mr. Glen and his family who live right next door, and Dennis, who’s just a stone's throw away. They've been amazing people to me, almost like extended family, and I truly appreciate their kindness. Remembering Mr. Glen’s wedding, where his new wife, Ms. Veda, tossed the wedding bouquet, and I managed to catch the garter but missed the flowers? It was an unforgettable night, and dancing with Marsharii, one of his daughters, was the cherry on top. I haven’t seen Marsharii since, but I hope she's doing well. Our neighborhood is a bit like a labyrinth, but with a GPS now, I've been exploring more. I've hung out with Kason and Curtis in some parts, and we had tons of fun playing video games and enjoying life. Sometimes, I visit the park to find solace in nature, which really calms my soul. I bring along sticks from Home Depot to practice my balance and my bokken wooden sword if I can. I also enjoy using the basketball and tennis courts, although it’s been a while since I’ve played either sport. My dad taught me and my best friend tennis with Mr. Graves back in the day, and we always had a blast. There’s plenty of fun memories here, and I'm excited about what's to come!",
            "My neighborhood is conveniently close to the college that I attend, which makes living here quite pleasant. The area is predominantly apartment buildings, but there are some restaurants and bars that provide a fun atmosphere without breaking the bank. Recently, one of the bars was renamed, and while it's now a bit pricier, the quality of service and drinks remains good. Most of the people I encounter are either college students or lower-income individuals, as the apartment housing is reasonably priced. An elementary school is nearby, and while I don't know my neighbors, they're generally nice. However, they smoke a lot of weed, so the building management installed an air freshener unit near their door, which my boyfriend and I found amusing. The buildings surrounding me are quite old but may have well-renovated interiors. Down the street, there are new apartments, but I'm not fond of them due to poor construction and high rents. There's a restaurant a few minutes away that serves most food on paper plates and uses a microwave, along with a gas station that's not great for employees. Fortunately, the road has been improved with city funding, adding a nice sidewalk and green spaces. My apartment building is surrounded by trees, and while a few were cut down, there are more than those down the road. Behind my complex is a tree line and another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but the buildings on 43rd street are less appealing due to poor sidewalks and rundown buildings. While the trees hide some of the dilapidated structures, there are criminal incidents at the apartment complex on that street. However, I appreciate my neighborhood because it's affordable and offers plenty of useful amenities, such as the university within walking distance and two bus stops for easy access to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood is filled with duplexes on a cul-de-sac, spaced out like individual homes. Each unit is painted yellow, with white porches and green metal roofs, giving it a distinct look. Most residents are friendly, often gathering at the end of the drive, chatting while kids play with toys, chalk, or fly kites. It's a refreshing change from the modern, tech-filled world. We're bordered by fields and trees, with blue skies and billowing clouds. The only downside? This season, we've been under tornado warnings. Last night, we heard the sirens and had to rush to shelter. I found myself in my bathtub, clutching my little dog, purse, and pillows. My bigger dog stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The storm brought hail, and the road literally steamed after the temperature drop. It was like a scene from a movie—from 92°F to 75°F in minutes. The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement. After the storm, the sun came out, revealing a double rainbow. I quickly grabbed my camera and snapped pictures to share. The neighborhood was quiet until some people returned home. Soon, it was back to normal, with moms and children outside, dinner cooking. It's a friendly community, a huge change from my life back in New Hampshire. I live in a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, like everyone else, but not all apartments are the same inside. Some are quite small. I love walking down the big field behind my house and listening to the giant bullfrog in the morning. It's a small-town vibe with roosters crowing and a nearby farm with a donkey. It's a gem of a neighborhood to be found just outside Charlotte.",
            "When I moved to this neighborhood right before eighth grade, it was a bit of a struggle to make friends at first, but eventually I connected with someone living two houses down and another guy on my street. Neither of them live here anymore, but the memories of those friendships remain. The same folks who lived here when I first arrived are still around. My neighborhood is pretty standard for an American suburban area, filled with two-story houses. On warm weekends, you can hear kids playing outside. Most days, it's quiet. I've never had any issues with my neighbors. They're all quite self-sufficient and helpful when needed. I've ordered numerous packages online without any problems, so I feel secure leaving them on my porch. I trust my neighbors implicitly.\n\nThere's a park just a couple of minutes walk from my house, where I've played basketball, football, and baseball with the neighborhood kids. Some of those games ended with bruises, like the time I got elbowed in the nose while playing football, but the good times outweigh the bad. Now, I visit the park to hang out with my cousin's kids, who love the swings and slides. Seeing them enjoy the park brings back a lot of nostalgia for me.\n\nOur neighborhood is quite diverse, with various cuisines nearby. Within a mile radius, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. Nowadays, many people use food delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get their meals, and fast food joints are easy to find in any suburban area. There are also plenty of pizza places around. The stores here carry everything you need, including multiple dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store. There's even an Indian-owned store if you're feeling adventurous with your cooking or just want some ready-made Indian food.\n\nOverall, I'm quite fond of my neighborhood. Reading about the issues others face with their neighbors on social media and the news makes me grateful for mine.",
            "My neighborhood is a charming little town in South Carolina. It's not too different from others, but it has a notable influence on the agricultural industry. Johnston is famously known as the Peach Capital of the World, a title proudly displayed on the welcoming sign. The town is primarily farmland, with peach orchards and cattle pastures taking center stage. Houses, which are usually two-story with either metal or gray shingle roofs, are spaced out, with many located further back to allow for front fields to be used for farming. In the town center, there's a single stop sign at a four-way intersection where you'll find the only stores. There are three places to grab a meal on the go: Hong Kong, a family-owned Chinese restaurant; Fiesta Mexican Restaurant; and Gary's, a small burger place. A pizzeria used to be there, but it closed down recently. There's also a small family pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug, renowned for their Cherry Coca-Cola. The only grocery store is Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, but many residents prefer to shop at a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for most of their groceries. The most popular store is Dollar General, which is always bustling. Across from the furniture store is a pet grooming business called Clark's Cuts and Kennels, offering services like daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and bathing. Both a doctor's office and a vet clinic are located away from town, though they are well-equipped to serve the town's residents. Johnston Elementary School is the only school in the town, with students attending middle and high school in a nearby town after fifth grade. There are no parks, but the town is working on creating a 2.5-acre recreational area to enhance family activities and attract more visitors. Despite the lack of entertainment options like movie theaters, bowling alleys, or hangout spots, Johnston is a pleasant town, small enough to be passed through quickly!",
            "The first time I heard of this place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a bit unexpected. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. None of my friends had heard about it either. Maybe it's the daily grind. A few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night because of the high cost of living. We've all learned to be thrifty over the years. You start to appreciate the smell of vintage toys and secondhand clothes. You don't notice it as much in adulthood. Some of us take up smoking, or we just get used to it. But the flea market is always present. The scent of adulthood lingers in old magazines piled on a closed piano. It sticks to the leather and won't go away, even after you clean. Here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start from the far end, you can visit two charity thrift shops, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling, with cars and people filling the streets every morning, but it's quiet inside the thrift stores. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store remains silent. It's a tranquil place to spend an afternoon. Each year, the city seems to grow busier. Cars and people flood it constantly. It's a developing city, they say. With one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still growing, showing signs of its struggles. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is focused on their own goals, and no one asks much of you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a bit concerned seems like you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here. You can maintain your distance as long as you want, and the city will keep moving like the waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something happening. In a way, I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl, but it's people like my neighbors who make me feel like I haven't completely ruined my life.",
            "The place I call home is your typical cookie cutter suburbia. The most noticeable thing about my neighborhood is the strict presence of a homeowner's association (HOA). The moment you step in, you're greeted by well-maintained single-family homes—all thanks to the HOA's meticulous upkeep. The front yards are all similar, with a small patch of grass, decorative pebbles, and short driveways. Occasionally, you'll spot a small tree. Every house has a two-car garage. As you drive through, you'll notice newly paved concrete roads in pristine condition, with no potholes in sight. Most houses are single-story, though you'll sometimes see two-story ones. Instead of individual mailboxes in front of each house, we have a communal setup at the end of the street, with large groupings of mailboxes and two larger lockers for packages. This uniformity is another attribute of the HOA's influence. My neighborhood is on the outskirts of the nearby city, making it a blend of rural and suburban living. This means we have plenty of land for various activities. We have multiple community pools, walking trails for dog walks or evening strolls, and no need to visit a park for exercise. Most residents are retired, with a small mix of middle-aged and young professionals. The city itself is surprisingly large in population but retains a small-town feel. We have most of the amenities you'd expect—like a single mall that's not huge but gets the job done. It takes about 15 minutes to drive to significant areas, where you'll find a variety of stores, from high-end grocery stores with organic options to bargain outlets with minimal staff. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have great facilities like pools and walking trails, and while we're not next door to major shopping, a quick car ride gets you there.",
            "I reside in a small Midwestern town, just on the outskirts of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, located on the east side, is the town's most economically disadvantaged area. Most houses here are rented out to or owned by low-income individuals. Despite this, it's not an unpleasant place to live. My neighbors are generally friendly folks who greet you with a smile as you walk down the street. While crime rates are slightly higher than other parts of town, they're still manageable. We've seen a few violent incidents here over the past decade, including a shooting and a homicide within a few blocks of my home. Fortunately, our family hasn't been directly impacted by crime. Our close neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. The opioid epidemic has hit this town hard, with many lives lost due to fentanyl overdoses. However, there are resources available to combat this issue, like addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends. Despite these challenges, the town has many positive aspects. My son's elementary school has excellent staff, and he's thriving despite having special needs. The school's positive atmosphere has prevented any bullying. The PTO organizes multiple events to promote family involvement and educational progress. Since over 20% of the town's population lives below the poverty line, the school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students. No child or family is treated as \"less than\" due to financial constraints. School fees, supplies, and field trip costs are affordable. The City Council has made many improvements to the town's appearance, like repaving roads and refurbishing city parks, but most of these improvements have been focused on the center and the west side, where shopping areas are located. The east side, where I live, tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for us. Nevertheless, I enjoy living here. People are friendly, the schools are great, and there are sufficient shopping options. Our home might not be worth much, but it's comfortable and adequate. Our family has been living here for over 16 years, and we can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is a cultural treasure trove, nestled on a hill, encircled by structures steeped in history. I call home a 7-story apartment building, just across the old live theatre, and a block down, there's a charming arcade bar that attracts all sorts of folks on warm summer evenings. On weekends in June and July, you might witness a line of people eager to enter. A few blocks up, lies the nearest city park, quite spacious for its location. Concrete steps surround the park, and during the harsh winter months, homeless individuals set up their tents in neat rows, close together to keep warm. Though it doesn't snow much, torrential rains in mid-winter make it challenging to stay cozy. They're near enough to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I adore about my city isn't the historical architecture, though it's impressive, but the people. Hilltop, once infamous for gang violence, still echoes with tales of the federal government's and DEA's efforts to clean its streets. Despite being one of the rougher 'hoods' in the city, the people here work hard to keep it tidy and still care deeply about their community. However, there's a lingering air of caution, especially for those who are white, to avoid the Hill after dark. I believe this warning is a remnant of the past, flavored with social conditioning. Perhaps my dark enough appearance allows me to blend in or maybe Hilltop perceives me as one of their own, someone acutely aware of the racial, cultural, and fearful assumptions that cloud our society. Regardless of where I roam, Hilltop will always be home. I feel alive walking its streets at night, receiving kindness from strangers more readily than threats. It's a place where laundry owners extend their hours to help out, and even on the greyest nights, someone might stop to offer a $5, complimenting my beauty and value.",
            "I call my home rural America, nestled in small-town Michigan. We transition from expansive farmlands to picturesque tourist cities, where big city conveniences like Walmart, Target, or Applebee’s are hard to find. Everywhere I need to go requires a drive, but I'm lucky to live in one of the most stunning places on Earth, surrounded by water. Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix flank my city, offering beaches for toe-dipping at every turn. My neighborhood encapsulates the essence of small-town living. Houses aren’t cookie-cutter or stacked, but rather older homes, some updated, some with aluminum siding. Most have full basements visible from the road, with yards featuring trampolines, playsets, gardens, and fences for pets. The houses reflect the hardworking people who call this place home, either raising families or having done so. Kids often play outside, and neighbors walk dogs, bike, or rollerblade. Neighbors recognize each other, and the lawns are well-maintained. It's not a neighborhood for show, but a serene, safe haven, perfect for family life. Essential services like the county sheriff’s department, health department, recycling center, baseball fields, and a small-town airport are nearby. You can hear small planes taking off and landing, and kids riding bikes to the park just eight blocks away. It's a great place to call home."
