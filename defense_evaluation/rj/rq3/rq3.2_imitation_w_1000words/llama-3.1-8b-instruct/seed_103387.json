            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "Lately, I've been living in a bustling city, where the streets are filled with people from all walks of life. My neighborhood is a melting pot, with residential areas scattered among commercial ones. You can find everything from offices to restaurants, stores, and entertainment spots. There are countless new restaurants to try and shops to browse, ranging from big, well-known brands to small, trendy boutiques. These boutiques not only line the malls but also occupy the streets, which are just a short walk from quiet neighborhoods that would otherwise be peaceful. I've noticed that people often visit the nearby parks with their kids, enjoying the fresh air and greenery. The diversity in my neighborhood is quite impressive, with a thriving LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a group of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union all living in the same area. Further afield, there are even more people from different racial and cultural backgrounds, though they often stick together in their own little communities within the city. We have areas like Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia, just a few miles away, but the traffic makes it a pain to get there. Rush hour is especially bad, and it takes a long time to drive short distances. People don't usually walk much in my city, given its size, so the traffic is atrocious, and parking spots are hard to come by. Despite all this, the city is seeing a lot of new construction, with massive apartment buildings going up left and right. While it's great for some, many residents are worried about the added crowds and traffic. My city has a wide range of houses, from single-family homes to apartment buildings and condominiums.

            "As we cruised past the seemingly endless corn fields that stretched as far as the eye could see, she asked, \"Where are we?\" I just smiled knowingly, anticipating the look of shock on her face as she took in the vastness of the open landscape. Coming from a town where the nearby grocery store was just a short 5-minute walk from her front door, she'd never experienced anything like this before. The sheer vastness of the corn fields left her speechless, and I took the opportunity to share with her what it was like growing up in rural Ohio. In that moment, she finally grasped who I was and where I came from.\n\nA two-lane country road led us to a quarry filled with water, followed by the small development where I reside.

Winters in my small town could be harsh, but there was something magical about the transformation. The once lush green yard would turn into an empty wilderness, with bare trees and the occasional snowfall turning it into a winter wonderland overnight. My little sister and I would spend hours making snow angels, building snowmen, and engaging in epic snowball fights. We'd construct massive igloo-like forts, armed with branches, to house our arsenal of snowballs.

            "The starting point for any visitor to Portland, Oregon, is to understand what it means to be \"weird\". A sign on the back of a building that serves as a multifaceted hub - a pizza joint, bar, music venue, and more - proudly displays the town's unofficial slogan: \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this phrase is a nostalgic reminder of the city's past, a time when it was less well-known and less expensive, fostering a unique cultural landscape. To others, it's an invitation to come and experience a place where being considered \"weird\" is a badge of honour. Despite an influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of new condominiums, Portland remains an unconventional city. \"Weird\" does not imply a complete rejection of modernity, but rather a willingness to accept the unconventional and the unusual. Like many cities, we consume many of our goods from China. However, Portland has its own brand of normalcy, with yoga enthusiasts, hipsters, and business professionals coexisting with a more eclectic crowd. Perhaps what makes Portland unique is its carefree attitude towards these contrasts. In my own neighbourhood, as with many in Portland, you'll find vibrant houses, lush home gardens, and in the summertime, free boxes lining the streets. Free boxes can contain anything - clothes, books, or even household items - and they're a treasure trove waiting to be discovered. The magic of stumbling upon a hidden gem in a Southeast Portland neighbourhood is what makes this city so special. To me, that's what Portland is all about, but I'm just one of many individuals who call this city home. Some of my neighbours would never dream of rummaging through a free box for second-hand items. Instead, they might attend goat yoga or a Portland Timbers match. What's remarkable about this city is the diversity of interests and passions that its residents possess. We're a city of dreamers, both those who are actively pursuing their passions and those who are still daydreaming about them, often over a drink at a local bar. Of course, like many cities, Portland struggles with substance abuse issues, which often stem from deeper mental health problems. The city's signature grey skies and constant rain may also contribute to this issue. Additionally, Portland faces a homelessness crisis, which is a challenge that many cities grapple with. While we offer better social services than some other parts of the country, they're still insufficient. The general public is torn between sympathy and frustration towards the homeless population. In this regard, Portland is not so weird after all.",
            "The mountains have always stood tall, a constant presence in the north, silently witnessing the dawn and dusk of each day. Unfazed by the turmoil of life, their steadfastness is a comforting reminder, especially when I'm consumed by stress and anxiety. It's as if they beckon me to come closer, offering a respite for my weary soul. I first laid eyes on them when I started my undergrad, and they've held a special place in my heart ever since. While the university has its own share of breathtaking spots, the mountains are the true crown jewel. The rest of the town has its own charm, with quaint cafes and old buildings that exude an air of history. Yet, it's the mountains that draw me in, their rugged grandeur a stark contrast to the bustling downtown area. The town's duality is a fascinating aspect - from the vibrant high street to the serene library, each area has its unique character. It's this contrast that makes the town so captivating, as if it's inviting me to explore and create memories. Whether it's strolling through the park with friends or racing through the downtown streets to catch the latest movie, every part of town holds a special place in my heart. However, it's also a place where painful memories reside, much like anywhere else in life. The ponds, in particular, have been a sanctuary for me, a place to reflect and cry during the darkest moments. As I watched the turtles and ducks living their lives, I couldn't help but ponder my own purpose and the mysteries of life. I'd walk past the pond, the park, and the houses, until I reached the main street, where the sun would paint the sky with its vibrant hues. And as I looked up at the sunrise, I'd realize I was walking north, drawn to the mountains that stood tall, a constant reminder of my determination.",
            "If you're planning a trip to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, don't worry - you'll have no issue finding it. The area is well-connected to public transportation, which is one of the most popular ways to get around New York City. Bensonhurst itself is an urban neighborhood, offering the hustle and bustle of the city. When exploring, you'll notice a plethora of Asian stores scattered throughout the area. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurst has seen a significant influx of Asian residents, resulting in an abundance of Asian-owned businesses - at least one per block. You'll likely find yourself surrounded by Asian-owned supermarkets and laundromats. These businesses are extremely popular among locals, offering top-notch food, affordable prices, and unparalleled convenience. I'm lucky enough to be close to four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walking distance from each other. This convenience makes accessing grocery shopping a breeze. While Bensonhurst isn't exclusively occupied by Asian residents, the area is culturally diverse, with immigrants and their children from various generations calling it home.\n\nMajority-owned businesses in the area are Asian-owned, but you'll also find a beautifully renovated park nearby, boasting over ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy in the summer. As you're in the heart of New York City, expect to see an array of diversity in the park, with people from all walks of life getting along harmoniously. Unlike other areas in the city, Bensonhurst doesn't have large corporate buildings; instead, you'll find co-op living spaces and condominium apartments. The majority of the living spaces are two-family houses. The locals are generally nice but can be a bit rowdy. Be prepared for loud cars blasting music as you walk by or people flooring their gas in the morning, which might wake you up. If you're planning a nighttime visit, be cautious - the neighborhood is generally safe, but you might encounter people looking for trouble or bullies. I've personally experienced bullying in the past, but it was a long time ago. More recently, there have been incidents of package theft. While it's a common issue elsewhere, package thieves do exist in Bensonhurst. One of my pet peeves is the lack of cleanliness in the neighborhood - specifically, dog waste everywhere. Be mindful of your surroundings, especially in the mornings, and keep your shoes clean!",
            "I live in a place with very limited sidewalks. Our house sits at the top of a steep hill in the neighborhood, which makes it a great spot for joggers to get a good workout. They often refer to it as the \"workout hill.\" Since there are no sidewalks on my street, everyone has to walk on the road, which can be a bit hazardous due to potholes and uneven surfaces. The telephone and electric wires surrounding my neighborhood are often in disrepair, with tattered-looking cables and patchwork repairs from frequent storm damage. We get a lot of rain and storms here, which causes branches and debris to fall on the power lines. \n\nThe area is surrounded by tall evergreen trees, but people around here aren't fans of them. They try to cut them down as much as possible because they block the view of the ocean. As a result, many houses are built high up on the hill with large glass windows to take in the view of the bay. It's beautiful during sunset when the water below is lit up and the sky turns orange. However, most days are overcast and cloudy, making it hard to see the sunlight clearly. Moss grows everywhere, from roofs to cars to railings, due to the constant dampness. I once left my car outside for a month, and when I returned, it was covered in moss and took me hours to clean off. The neighborhood is mostly made up of older residents, with many retirees. We don't have many kids around, but there's a school not far away. Instead of kids, we have a lot of dogs running around. They often sit in front of houses or chase each other down the street. If you leave a door or window open, they might sneak in. I once found one in my living room and had to shoo it out. Rabbits are also common in our area, and they can cause problems for gardeners by digging up plant roots and burrowing into lawns. However, my cats love them and have managed to hunt most of them out of our neighborhood. We also have a variety of birds, including small sparrows, hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle that gets chased off by the neighborhood crows. If you're willing to hike down to the waterfront, there are some restaurants that serve fresh seafood, but the beach itself is small and not very wide. You can still see the opposite shoreline clearly even on misty days.",
            "I live in a typical suburban area in a small town in the southern part of Tennessee. Our street is a connecting route between two state highways, resulting in a moderate amount of traffic, which I don't always enjoy. However, the neighborhood remains relatively quiet, with not too many people moving in and out. I've grown accustomed to the familiar faces that live around here. Most residents spend their days tending to their yards and other daily tasks. In the winter, we enjoy sledding down a nearby hill on our street. Our house, located at the corner of our street, allows us to see everyone passing by and become familiar with the vehicles that frequent our area. Whenever a stranger's car passes by, we tend to take notice. Some of our neighbors go for walks or take their dogs out for exercise. Kids can often be seen riding their bikes and engaging in typical neighborhood activities. Since we work from home, we're often at home, along with my wife and our two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen. As a result, everyone is used to seeing us come and go. We enjoy spending time outside, even on rainy days. Occasionally, we fire up the grill on our back deck, and the delicious smell of barbecue fills the air. The sounds of lawn mowers are a regular occurrence from March to October, when the grass growth slows down. Our neighborhood was originally a wooded area, so we have plenty of trees providing shade, but also a lot of leaves in the fall, which means raking and burning them every year. I enjoy the smell of burning leaves, marking the arrival of fall. Lately, we've been experiencing mild winters, making it feel like an extended fall season. Our garage is located at the back of our house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone knocks, which is a rare occurrence. I like tinkering with my truck or other projects in the garage, and when the doors are open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, the neighborhood is relatively quiet, with some families visiting from out of town during special occasions like Thanksgiving and Christmas. If it weren't a through street, I think our neighborhood would be perfect.",
            "I live in a neighborhood that's smack in the middle of the high desert, where the landscape is dominated by dirt and dust. Unless you've experienced living here, it's hard to grasp the feeling of seeing nothing but brown everywhere you look. It's not until you spot a lawn that you realize the owner must be breaking the bank to keep it looking that way. When I first moved here in the 90s, houses were spread out, but nowadays, it's pretty much the same, with some new additions popping up. The area is slowly transforming into a city, but I suppose that's a trend we see everywhere. On the plus side, the people here are generally friendly, though, just like any city, we have our good and bad sides. I'm surrounded by friendly, older folks, which makes it a nice neighborhood. The shopping scene is pretty basic, with just the usual chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you're looking for something upscale, you'll have to drive a bit. You won't find any Whole Foods or similar stores around here. The main industries in my city seem to be construction, which makes sense, given how undeveloped the area still is, with plenty of open spaces left to build on. That's a bit unsettling, but after living in a big city, I'm not eager to go back. My job is actually in the construction industry – I work as a drywall and T-bar installer. One thing I appreciate about my home is the diverse wildlife. People come to the high desert for its natural beauty, and it's home to unique ecosystems that need protecting. It's essential for human residents to learn about the non-human inhabitants of our environment to live in harmony. My family and I have adapted well to the local wildlife. My three kids are obsessed with lizards and desert bugs, and as I write this, they're outside trying to catch different specimens. As for attractions, we have a few. Victorville is a great place for families to experience the desert, and if you can, plan your visit to coincide with the annual San Bernardino County Fair. The fair offers a great mix of activities and fun in the Victorville style. If you head to nearby Wrightwood, you can see the snow-covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to cap off your visit. If you're interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem, the Victor Valley Museum is a great place to start. It features geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of Victorville's development and industry.",
            "When someone asks me to describe my neighbourhood, I'm pretty sure my answer would be quite unique. Unlike others who might be homeowners with their own life, my situation is a bit different. My neighbourhood is where I'm studying, and the people living in my dorm are like my community. The surrounding campus is part of my neighbourhood as well, but to a lesser extent. Although my neighbourhood is a bit unconventional, it shares some qualities with the typical idea of a neighbourhood. For instance, it has houses, people, shops and parks, just like any normal neighbourhood. Let's start with the \"houses\" that make up my neighbourhood. Before I dive into that, I should clarify the types of houses you can find around here. There are three types: apartments, houses, and dormitory houses. Firstly, the apartments usually have 2-4 people in each room, and there are 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type has about 2 floors, so there are around 20 people living in each building. Next, there are the houses that are available for rent, usually with 2-4 bedrooms. They're mostly occupied by alumni, but there aren't many of them around. Finally, there are the dorm rooms, where you'll find hundreds of students sharing rooms with one other person, except for a few exceptions. It's the most common type of housing in my neighbourhood. Now that we've covered the houses, let's talk about the people. My school values diversity, and it's reflected in my neighbourhood. People from all walks of life and different ages live here. The professional staff live in the houses, while the new students stay in the dorms and the older students in the apartments. Since my school is essentially a self-contained neighbourhood, it has plenty of shops and a single park. The shops offer a mix of food options and the school's own brands of clothing and groceries, so you can get anything you need without leaving. The park is a playground for everyone in the neighbourhood, kept clean and safe by all of us who live here.",
            "Well, after 10 years of living here, I think I can share my experiences with you. When I first moved to this neighborhood, I was pretty sad. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge with my family, and I have to admit, I cried because I missed my old home and friends. But my parents wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for a house, a better high school, and a more comfortable life. As time went by, I started to get used to the new place and made some new friends, but also encountered some not-so-friendly people in school. I didn't really get to know my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his family, and Dennis, who lived right next to us. They're wonderful people whom I consider as a kind of family, and I appreciate them greatly.\n\nI still remember when we went to Mr. Glen's wedding. It was a fun and memorable day, and I'm looking forward to experiencing something similar in the future when I settle down and give my future partner the life they deserve. When Mr. Glen's wife, Ms. Veda, removed her white strap and threw it, I managed to catch it, but unfortunately, I missed catching the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I enjoyed spending time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven't seen her since, but I hope she's doing well and pursuing her dreams.\n\nLiving in this neighborhood can be a bit confusing at times, but with the help of GPS, I've been able to explore it more. I've only ventured out with my friends Kason and Curtis so far, and we used to spend hours playing video games and enjoying life to the fullest. Sometimes I'd visit the park to connect with nature and find some peace. It's amazing how it can calm my mind and soothe my soul. I'd also bring sticks I bought from Home Depot and practice my balance, and sometimes I'd take my wooden sword, the bokken, with me. I love doing what I love and having fun.\n\nWe also have a basketball and tennis court in the neighborhood, although I haven't played tennis or basketball in a while. It's nice to have them available if I ever want to pick up the sport again. My dad taught me and my best friend to play tennis with Mr. Graves, and we always had a great time, even though they made us work hard. But that's what made it so enjoyable. I've had many wonderful experiences in this neighborhood, and there are more stories to share, but these are the ones that stand out to me, and I'm excited to see what the future holds.",
            "My place is literally just a stone's throw away from my college, which is why I'm so fond of living here. I have the luxury of living amidst apartment buildings, some cheap eateries, and a few bars that are fun to hang out at without burning a hole in my pocket. One of the bars just got a new name, and it's a bit pricier, but the quality of service and drinks are decent, and the people there are quite friendly. They're either students or low-income residents, considering the affordable apartment prices. There's a bunch of kids around since the nearby elementary school is within walking distance, but I don't really know my neighbors. They smoke a lot of weed, and the management of my building installed an air freshener right in front of their door, which my boyfriend and I found hilarious - it's almost like they're being mocked. The buildings around me are a bit old-looking, but maybe they've got renovated insides. A bit down the street, there are brand new apartments that look fancy, but I'm not a fan of them. They claim to be high-end but I'm pretty sure they're cheaply built, and the rent is way too steep. I think it's just a rip-off, but I guess since they're close to campus, the management can get away with it. There's a super cheap restaurant just about five minutes from my place that serves paper plates with mostly microwaved food. I also have a gas station right across from it, which, I've heard, isn't a great place to work. However, thanks to some city funds, the road was renovated last summer, and now we have a nice wide sidewalk, decent grass, and a more pleasant atmosphere. My apartment building is pretty shaded with trees, but the management cut a few down, leaving stumps behind. There are way more trees where I live compared to the other side of the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line, and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but just behind it is 43rd street, which isn't as nice. The sidewalks are all crumbled, and the buildings look shabby. There are a lot of trees there too, but I think they're just to hide the state of the buildings. Most of the crime in my area happens at an apartment complex on that street, but I'm not gonna blame just them - it's a problem that affects the whole area. There are apartments across the street from me that have their own share of crime and a rather transient population. Still, I like where I live. It's affordable, and there are plenty of useful amenities nearby, including the university and two bus stops that make it easy for me to get to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighbourhood is a quiet haven, composed of double-storey houses on a cul-de-sac. The homes are spaced out, giving the illusion of being individual houses. However, they all share the same distinct features - a vibrant yellow exterior, crisp white porches, and emerald green metal roofs. While most residents are friendly with one another, not everyone is acquaintances. We often gather at the end of a winding driveway in the evenings, engaging in casual conversations as the neighbourhood kids play with their toys, colour with sidewalk chalk, or fly their kites. It's a refreshing respite from the fast-paced, tech-obsessed world we live in, reminiscent of a bygone era. The scenery is picturesque - rolling fields, towering trees, and a brilliant blue sky dotted with puffy white clouds. Yet, Mother Nature can be unpredictable. This season, we've been plagued by tornado warnings, and for the first time, we heard the eerie sound of actual tornado sirens last night, prompting us to seek shelter. I found myself taking refuge in my bathtub, clutching my smallest dog and essentials, while my bigger dog remained in the living room, anxious and barking. The neighbourhood was eerily quiet, except for the deafening sound of large hail pounding the ground. As the storm passed, the temperature plummeted from 92 to 75 degrees in a matter of minutes. The hail instantly melted upon hitting the scorching pavement. As the skies cleared, the sun peeked through, and a double rainbow appeared. I quickly grabbed my camera to capture the breathtaking scene, eager to share it with my friends and family on Facebook. They, like me, were amazed by the spectacle. The streets remained deserted for another hour before people began returning home from wherever they were when the storm struck. Once again, life returned to normal - dinner was cooking, and mothers and children were outside enjoying the evening. As a transplant from New Hampshire to North Carolina, I've grown fond of the region's distinct southern drawl. My two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment, like everyone else's, may look identical from the outside, but each has its unique character inside. Some are surprisingly compact, leaving me perplexed. I cherish strolling through the expansive field behind my home, making my way to the pond, which, unfortunately, isn't suitable for swimming. I've spotted deer and, in the mornings, I'm serenaded by the deep, melodic song of the giant bullfrog. It's a fantastic place to call home, situated just 40 minutes from the bustling city of Charlotte. Each morning begins with the cheerful sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms, giving our neighbourhood a village-like atmosphere. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that brays in the evening, letting us know he's still there. I feel fortunate to have discovered this hidden gem of a neighbourhood.",
            "It was during my 8th grade year when I moved into this neighbourhood. It took me a while to make friends, but I eventually became close with two guys, one who lives just two houses down and another on the same street. Although neither of them lives here anymore, the memories we made together still linger. The people who were here when I first arrived are still here, for the most part. My neighbourhood is pretty much like any other American suburb. There are plenty of two-storey houses, and on warm days, I can hear the kids playing outside every weekend. Most days are quiet, but you're never left on your own unless you need help. I've ordered several packages online without any issues, and my neighbours are trustworthy. Just a minute or two away from my house is a park where I've spent many happy times. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there with my friends, and it's also where I got one of my worst injuries - a nasty elbow to the nose while playing football. However, the good memories far outweigh the bad. These days, I visit the park with my cousin's kids. They're still young and love playing on the swings and slides. The thought of going to the park always brings back a flood of memories. The neighbourhood is quite diverse, and you can find all sorts of food nearby. Within a one-mile radius, there are Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants, although many people now prefer ordering food through apps like GrubHub and DoorDash. The most popular places are fast food shops, but you can find those just about anywhere. There are also many pizza places. The stores here have everything you could ever need, including multiple dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is a staple in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even run by Indians, catering to those who want to cook homemade Indian food or buy ready-made dishes. All in all, I'm a big fan of my neighbourhood. Seeing the horror stories on social media and news about people's experiences with their neighbours makes me grateful for the ones I have.",
            "My hometown of Johnston is a charming little place that doesn't stand out from the rest of the towns in South Carolina, but it holds a significant influence in the agricultural sector. It proudly claims to be the Peach Capital of the World, a title showcased on the welcoming sign at the town's entrance. The landscape is mainly dominated by vast farmlands of either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't situated in the town center are spaced out, with most being two-story homes featuring metal roofs to combat the scorching summer heat or gray shingles. These homes are often situated away from the main road, allowing for the front fields to be used for farming. In the town center, there's only one traffic light at a four-way intersection. It's here that you'll find the town's few stores. There are three options for quick bites: Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. A pizzeria used to be in operation, but it closed down a while ago. Maxwell and Halford Drug is a small family-owned pharmacy that's surprisingly famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola. Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA for short, is a small and pricey grocery store that's the town's only option. While it's the main grocery store, many residents prefer to travel to the Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville to buy most of their groceries. The most popular store in town, though, is Dollar General, which sells a wide variety of everyday essentials and is always bustling from opening to closing. There's also a small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind community figure who employs two movers to deliver purchased items. Right next door is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a small pet grooming service that offers various services like daycare, boarding, grooming, and more. Both the doctor's office and veterinary clinic are located outside the town center, but they're well-equipped to serve the town's residents. We have a single elementary school, Johnston Elementary School, which serves students up to fifth grade. After that, students move on to middle and high school in the neighboring town. Although there aren't any parks within the town, a new 2.5-acre recreational area is currently under construction to provide families with more opportunities for outings and attract new visitors or residents. Despite its limited attractions, Johnston is a nice place that's so small you could drive right by without even noticing it.",
            "The first time I heard about my place, it was while listening to a podcast about people who went missing. It left a surprising impression on me. Almost every apartment in the area was renting for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story before, and my friends hadn't either. It made me think about the struggles we all face. I know some of my friends struggle to sleep at night because of the costs. Things are expensive, but over time, we've learned to be thrifty. You start to accept the dusty smell of flea market items and worn-out clothes. You notice you smell less in adulthood. You might start smoking or become accustomed to the way things are. However, the flea market always manages to assert itself. The smell of adulthood is the musty smell of old magazines on an old piano, which even washing the piano can't remove. Here, there're three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can visit two charity stores, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curio shop. Downtown is crowded, with cars and people filling the streets every morning, but inside the thrift stores, you'll find silence. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store remains quiet. It's a nice place to spend an afternoon. Every year, the area gets busier, with more cars and people flooding the streets. It's a developing city, they say. As one of the largest e-commerce and delivery empires is headquartered here, it's still dealing with growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone's focused on their goals, and nobody really asks for much. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's different from the South, where showing a little concern means you care. You don't pry into people's lives here; you can keep your shell as long as you like, and the city will move along like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. There's always something going on, whether it's the pianist next door or the two amateur singers upstairs. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. I feel fortunate to live here. I quite like my neighbors, and they treat me well. I try to keep my apartment clean and leave food for them, and they do the same for me. I bring their mail, and they bring mine. It's nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my presence just as much as I do theirs. Despite living in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl, it's my neighbors who make me feel like I haven't ruined my life completely.",
            "My neighborhood is a pretty standard suburban area, with a strong presence of a homeowner's association that maintains the look and feel of the place. As soon as you step in, you'll notice the neatly kept single-family homes, all thanks to the HOA. Every house has a similar front yard with a patch of grass, decorative pebbles, and short driveways. Small trees are scattered around, and everyone has a two-car garage. The roads are also well-maintained, with newly paved concrete and no potholes in sight. The houses are mostly one story, but some have two stories as well. Instead of individual mailboxes, we have a system of shared mailboxes at the end of the street, which requires a key to access. There are also two large lockers for packages - another testament to the HOA's focus on uniformity. Our neighborhood is situated on the outskirts of the nearby city, giving us a mix of rural and suburban vibes. We have plenty of land for everything, including multiple community pools that are well-maintained and gated, and walking trails where you can take your dog or enjoy a peaceful evening stroll. Since most of the community is made up of retired folks, it's a very safe area where everyone looks out for each other. We also have a smaller number of middle-aged and young professionals living here. The nearby city is surprisingly large in terms of population, but it feels like a small town. We have all the amenities you'd expect, including a mall that's not too big but gets the job done. It takes around 15 minutes to drive to significant places, but once you get there, you'll find a variety of stores to choose from, ranging from high-end grocery stores to bargain outlets. Overall, my neighborhood is a safe, well-maintained, and pretty standard place to live, with plenty of nice features like pools and walking trails.",
            "Yesterday, I thought to myself, I really love my little Midwestern town, nestled just outside a bustling city. It's not fancy, but it's home. Our neighborhood on the east side is indeed the most economically challenged area in town, with property values being relatively low. People own or rent houses here, but that's just the way it is. Don't get me wrong, it's not ugly or unpleasant. Everyone in my neighborhood is super friendly. They greet me warmly when I stroll down the street, and we all have a good time chatting. Of course, there's a slightly higher crime rate compared to other parts of town, but we've been lucky so far. I mean, there have been some instances of violence in the past decade, but fortunately, we haven't been directly affected. Our neighbors' son lost his life in a shooting near the local watering hole last year, but we've been fortunate enough to avoid any serious issues like that. The only time we've been affected by crime was when we forgot to bring something inside, and it went missing from our porch. Our town is one of those places that has been hit hard by the opioid epidemic that's sweeping across America. Sadly, many lives have been lost to fentanyl overdoses, but we're fortunate to have plenty of resources to help combat this issue. There are several addiction rehab centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those struggling with addiction.\n\nDespite all this, our town has its bright spots. My son's elementary school is top-notch, with amazing staff from the principal to the teachers and support staff. He's got special needs, but he's never been bullied due to the incredibly positive vibe at school. He loves going there. We have a very active PTO that organizes loads of events throughout the year to get families involved and promote educational progress. Since over 20% of our town's population lives below the poverty line, the school offers free breakfast and lunch to every student, so no child ever goes hungry. No one is looked down upon because they can't pay, and school fees, supplies, and field trips are super reasonable. The City Council and staff have made some great improvements to our town, like fixing roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these upgrades have happened in the center of town and on the west side, where the shopping areas are and most of the traffic passes through. Our side of town tends to get a bit neglected, which is a point of contention for us.\n\nAll in all, I really enjoy living here. People are friendly, the schools are great, and there are plenty of shopping options to meet our needs. Our home might not be worth much, but it's cozy and comfortable. We've been living here for over 16 years, and we can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is a melting pot of diverse cultures, nestled on a hill overlooking a tapestry of historic buildings. I reside in a 7-story apartment complex directly opposite the old theater, with a vibrant arcade bar a short stroll away. This popular hotspot draws in people from all walks of life on warm summer evenings, with long queues forming outside on weekends in June and July. Just a few blocks away lies the local city park, a significant green oasis in the midst of our bustling town. The park is encircled by concrete walls with stairs carved into the structure, providing a cozy abode for the homeless during the cold winter months. They huddle together in neat rows, sheltered from the rain and wind, yet still within walking distance of the local family center where they can access basic amenities like showers and bathing facilities.\n\nWhat I cherish about my neighborhood, however, isn't the grand architecture or the historic charm – it's the people themselves. You see, Hilltop was once notorious for gang violence, and the scars still linger. Even decades later, whispers of federal intervention and DEA crackdowns still circulate among the locals. The community has worked tirelessly to maintain their neighborhood's cleanliness, despite its reputation as one of the rougher areas in the city. They care deeply about their community and its well-being, passing down stories of the past to newcomers like me. A warning often shared among outsiders is that it's not safe to walk the Hill at night if you're white, a stigma that still lingers from the past. I believe this cautionary tale is a product of social conditioning, tainted with the bitter taste of racism and ignorance. Perhaps it's because I've grown accustomed to navigating these complexities, or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of their own – someone who understands the lingering remnants of societal prejudice. Whatever the reason, I know one thing: the Hilltop will always be my home. I feel most alive walking its streets at night, surrounded by people who've offered me kindness and compassion, rather than malice. It's a place where laundromat owners stay open late to help a lost soul, where strangers offer you a jacket on a cold night, and where you're reminded of your worth and beauty in a world that often tries to erase it.",
            "I'm living in Rural America, in the heart of a small town in Michigan. My place is surrounded by farmland and quaint tourist spots, with no massive city malls or big-name stores like Wal-mart, Target, or Applebee's. You need a car to get around here. Despite that, I'm blessed to live in one of the most beautiful spots on earth, flanked by the stunning Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. My hometown is literally surrounded by water, with beaches waiting to be explored. The neighborhood I live in reflects the charm of small-town life. Houses aren't stacked on top of each other like skyscrapers; they're unique, older homes that have been lovingly updated or remodeled over the years. Many of them have basements that can be seen from the road, giving them a cozy, welcoming feel. My neighborhood is a rainbow of colors, with houses sporting every hue imaginable, each one standing out in its own way. Most of these homes have spacious yards, complete with trampolines, playsets, and sometimes even gardens and animal enclosures. It's a quintessential Middle America feel, where families work hard to make a living and raise their kids. On any given day, you'll see kids running up and down the streets, people strolling with their dogs, biking, or rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors, and you can easily spot who fits in and who's a new face. You might catch someone grilling in their yard and wave, or see someone walking their dog from a few blocks away and smile in greeting. The lawns are well-maintained, with neatly trimmed grass and tidy gardens. It's not a picturesque neighborhood that'll leave you awestruck, but it's a place where you'd feel comfortable raising a family. It's quiet, peaceful, and safe. Within walking distance, you'll find the county sheriff's department and jail, the health department, and the local recycling center. We even have baseball and softball fields nearby, where you can hear the announcers calling out the scores and player names. The small-town airport is just a stone's throw away, and you can hear the rumble of small planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream at the local parlor or bike to the nearby park, which is just a short 8 blocks away. It's a fantastic place to call home."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "Lately, I've been living in a bustling city, where the streets are filled with people from all walks of life. My neighborhood is a melting pot, with residential areas scattered among commercial ones. You can find everything from offices to restaurants, stores, and entertainment spots. There are countless new restaurants to try and shops to browse, ranging from big, well-known brands to small, trendy boutiques. These boutiques not only line the malls but also occupy the streets, which are just a short walk from quiet neighborhoods that would otherwise be peaceful. I've noticed that people often visit the nearby parks with their kids, enjoying the fresh air and greenery. The diversity in my neighborhood is quite impressive, with a thriving LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a group of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union all living in the same area. Further afield, there are even more people from different racial and cultural backgrounds, though they often stick together in their own little communities within the city. We have areas like Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia, just a few miles away, but the traffic makes it a pain to get there. Rush hour is especially bad, and it takes a long time to drive short distances. People don't usually walk much in my city, given its size, so the traffic is atrocious, and parking spots are hard to come by. Despite all this, the city is seeing a lot of new construction, with massive apartment buildings going up left and right. While it's great for some, many residents are worried about the added crowds and traffic. My city has a wide range of houses, from single-family homes to apartment buildings and condominiums. It's not all about high-rise apartments; some people prefer to live in smaller, more intimate settings. Even in my own neighborhood, I see a mix of different housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of all ages, and I'm not really familiar with most of my neighbors. It's not the kind of close-knit community it used to be, but I do have fond memories of playing with my next-door neighbor and a few friends from back in the day.",
            "You know, my neighborhood's got a lot of character. Most of the houses are single-family homes, but there are a few that have been split into two, still connected in some way. My place has a tiny front yard and a small driveway to the left, pretty typical of the others. It's like stepping back in time, you know? People used to think that living in the suburbs was the ultimate dream, but now it's not as appealing as it used to be. Yet, my neighborhood's still here, still holding onto that dream, and it's like it's calling out to us, reminding us that it's still alive. The people around here aren't as optimistic as they used to be, the yards aren't as well-maintained as they once were, but you still see a car or two in every driveway, and the kids are still playing like the world revolves around them. The old public school that's been here for almost 90 years is still standing, still giving the kids hope for the future, and it's like a blast from the past for the older folks.

            "You might overlook it at first glance, but look closer and you'll discover a whole other world behind the rows of shops and hotels. It's not exactly the kind of place you'd expect to find a community, let alone one that's thriving. But if you venture behind the old Whole Foods, which has long been abandoned, and walk down the road behind the hotels that are only occupied for a short time each summer, you'll stumble upon a bustling neighborhood. Amidst this community are several apartment complexes, situated side by side like a string of carefully placed Russian nesting dolls. The first complex you'll come across has had its fair share of controversy, so we'll skip over that. However, the ones nearby are a different story altogether - a world that remains a secret to most people living in this area.\n\nAcross from these complexes stands a community college's satellite campus, a quiet, sleepy group of buildings that seem to stand guard over the road.

The iron gates creak open to let them in one by one, while commuters in their cars shake their fists at the traffic congestion caused by the increased attendance on certain days.

The treatment center boasts cheerful outdoor furniture and a lazily spinning ceiling fan that circulates the warm summer air.

            "As we cruised past the seemingly endless corn fields that stretched as far as the eye could see, she asked, \"Where are we?\" I just smiled knowingly, anticipating the look of shock on her face as she took in the vastness of the open landscape. Coming from a town where the nearby grocery store was just a short 5-minute walk from her front door, she'd never experienced anything like this before. The sheer vastness of the corn fields left her speechless, and I took the opportunity to share with her what it was like growing up in rural Ohio. In that moment, she finally grasped who I was and where I came from.\n\nA two-lane country road led us to a quarry filled with water, followed by the small development where I reside. The houses here are a mix of brick and stucco, each with at least half an acre of land that everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, the area is a kaleidoscope of colors, thanks to the annual flowers and midwestern trees that change with the seasons. You'll also notice the driveways lined with sleek, high-end Mercedes-Benz luxury cars that glisten in the sun after a refreshing wash. As we continued down the road, my neighbor, a friendly Korean man, was out mowing his lawn, singing along to the hum of his John Deere Zero Turn mower. His daily routine brings a smile to everyone's face, and it's not just his cheerful demeanor that makes him special – he's also got a fascinating story to tell.\n\nAs we approached my home, you'd notice the abundance of geese in the side yard, chased by our energetic Terrier. The sound of the nearby stream, bullfrogs, and the occasional moo from the nearby farms created a soothing background melody. Across the handmade wooden bridge lay an untouched oasis, teeming with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was where I spent most of my childhood, building tree forts, 'hunting' animals (which mostly involved chasing them), and making lifelong friends with the other neighborhood kids. Winters in my small town could be harsh, but there was something magical about the transformation. The once lush green yard would turn into an empty wilderness, with bare trees and the occasional snowfall turning it into a winter wonderland overnight. My little sister and I would spend hours making snow angels, building snowmen, and engaging in epic snowball fights. We'd construct massive igloo-like forts, armed with branches, to house our arsenal of snowballs. In that winter wonderland, we were carefree kids, with nothing but the joy of childhood to worry about.",
            "The starting point for any visitor to Portland, Oregon, is to understand what it means to be \"weird\". A sign on the back of a building that serves as a multifaceted hub - a pizza joint, bar, music venue, and more - proudly displays the town's unofficial slogan: \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this phrase is a nostalgic reminder of the city's past, a time when it was less well-known and less expensive, fostering a unique cultural landscape. To others, it's an invitation to come and experience a place where being considered \"weird\" is a badge of honour. Despite an influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of new condominiums, Portland remains an unconventional city. \"Weird\" does not imply a complete rejection of modernity, but rather a willingness to accept the unconventional and the unusual. Like many cities, we consume many of our goods from China. However, Portland has its own brand of normalcy, with yoga enthusiasts, hipsters, and business professionals coexisting with a more eclectic crowd. Perhaps what makes Portland unique is its carefree attitude towards these contrasts. In my own neighbourhood, as with many in Portland, you'll find vibrant houses, lush home gardens, and in the summertime, free boxes lining the streets. Free boxes can contain anything - clothes, books, or even household items - and they're a treasure trove waiting to be discovered. The magic of stumbling upon a hidden gem in a Southeast Portland neighbourhood is what makes this city so special. To me, that's what Portland is all about, but I'm just one of many individuals who call this city home. Some of my neighbours would never dream of rummaging through a free box for second-hand items. Instead, they might attend goat yoga or a Portland Timbers match. What's remarkable about this city is the diversity of interests and passions that its residents possess. We're a city of dreamers, both those who are actively pursuing their passions and those who are still daydreaming about them, often over a drink at a local bar. Of course, like many cities, Portland struggles with substance abuse issues, which often stem from deeper mental health problems. The city's signature grey skies and constant rain may also contribute to this issue. Additionally, Portland faces a homelessness crisis, which is a challenge that many cities grapple with. While we offer better social services than some other parts of the country, they're still insufficient. The general public is torn between sympathy and frustration towards the homeless population. In this regard, Portland is not so weird after all.",
            "The mountains have always stood tall, a constant presence in the north, silently witnessing the dawn and dusk of each day. Unfazed by the turmoil of life, their steadfastness is a comforting reminder, especially when I'm consumed by stress and anxiety. It's as if they beckon me to come closer, offering a respite for my weary soul. I first laid eyes on them when I started my undergrad, and they've held a special place in my heart ever since. While the university has its own share of breathtaking spots, the mountains are the true crown jewel. The rest of the town has its own charm, with quaint cafes and old buildings that exude an air of history. Yet, it's the mountains that draw me in, their rugged grandeur a stark contrast to the bustling downtown area. The town's duality is a fascinating aspect - from the vibrant high street to the serene library, each area has its unique character. It's this contrast that makes the town so captivating, as if it's inviting me to explore and create memories. Whether it's strolling through the park with friends or racing through the downtown streets to catch the latest movie, every part of town holds a special place in my heart. However, it's also a place where painful memories reside, much like anywhere else in life. The ponds, in particular, have been a sanctuary for me, a place to reflect and cry during the darkest moments. As I watched the turtles and ducks living their lives, I couldn't help but ponder my own purpose and the mysteries of life. I'd walk past the pond, the park, and the houses, until I reached the main street, where the sun would paint the sky with its vibrant hues. And as I looked up at the sunrise, I'd realize I was walking north, drawn to the mountains that stood tall, a constant reminder of my determination.",
            "If you're planning a trip to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, don't worry - you'll have no issue finding it. The area is well-connected to public transportation, which is one of the most popular ways to get around New York City. Bensonhurst itself is an urban neighborhood, offering the hustle and bustle of the city. When exploring, you'll notice a plethora of Asian stores scattered throughout the area. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurst has seen a significant influx of Asian residents, resulting in an abundance of Asian-owned businesses - at least one per block. You'll likely find yourself surrounded by Asian-owned supermarkets and laundromats. These businesses are extremely popular among locals, offering top-notch food, affordable prices, and unparalleled convenience. I'm lucky enough to be close to four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walking distance from each other. This convenience makes accessing grocery shopping a breeze. While Bensonhurst isn't exclusively occupied by Asian residents, the area is culturally diverse, with immigrants and their children from various generations calling it home.\n\nMajority-owned businesses in the area are Asian-owned, but you'll also find a beautifully renovated park nearby, boasting over ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy in the summer. As you're in the heart of New York City, expect to see an array of diversity in the park, with people from all walks of life getting along harmoniously. Unlike other areas in the city, Bensonhurst doesn't have large corporate buildings; instead, you'll find co-op living spaces and condominium apartments. The majority of the living spaces are two-family houses. The locals are generally nice but can be a bit rowdy. Be prepared for loud cars blasting music as you walk by or people flooring their gas in the morning, which might wake you up. If you're planning a nighttime visit, be cautious - the neighborhood is generally safe, but you might encounter people looking for trouble or bullies. I've personally experienced bullying in the past, but it was a long time ago. More recently, there have been incidents of package theft. While it's a common issue elsewhere, package thieves do exist in Bensonhurst. One of my pet peeves is the lack of cleanliness in the neighborhood - specifically, dog waste everywhere. Be mindful of your surroundings, especially in the mornings, and keep your shoes clean!",
            "I live in a place with very limited sidewalks. Our house sits at the top of a steep hill in the neighborhood, which makes it a great spot for joggers to get a good workout. They often refer to it as the \"workout hill.\" Since there are no sidewalks on my street, everyone has to walk on the road, which can be a bit hazardous due to potholes and uneven surfaces. The telephone and electric wires surrounding my neighborhood are often in disrepair, with tattered-looking cables and patchwork repairs from frequent storm damage. We get a lot of rain and storms here, which causes branches and debris to fall on the power lines. \n\nThe area is surrounded by tall evergreen trees, but people around here aren't fans of them. They try to cut them down as much as possible because they block the view of the ocean. As a result, many houses are built high up on the hill with large glass windows to take in the view of the bay. It's beautiful during sunset when the water below is lit up and the sky turns orange. However, most days are overcast and cloudy, making it hard to see the sunlight clearly. Moss grows everywhere, from roofs to cars to railings, due to the constant dampness. I once left my car outside for a month, and when I returned, it was covered in moss and took me hours to clean off. The neighborhood is mostly made up of older residents, with many retirees. We don't have many kids around, but there's a school not far away. Instead of kids, we have a lot of dogs running around. They often sit in front of houses or chase each other down the street. If you leave a door or window open, they might sneak in. I once found one in my living room and had to shoo it out. Rabbits are also common in our area, and they can cause problems for gardeners by digging up plant roots and burrowing into lawns. However, my cats love them and have managed to hunt most of them out of our neighborhood. We also have a variety of birds, including small sparrows, hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle that gets chased off by the neighborhood crows. If you're willing to hike down to the waterfront, there are some restaurants that serve fresh seafood, but the beach itself is small and not very wide. You can still see the opposite shoreline clearly even on misty days.",
            "I live in a typical suburban area in a small town in the southern part of Tennessee. Our street is a connecting route between two state highways, resulting in a moderate amount of traffic, which I don't always enjoy. However, the neighborhood remains relatively quiet, with not too many people moving in and out. I've grown accustomed to the familiar faces that live around here. Most residents spend their days tending to their yards and other daily tasks. In the winter, we enjoy sledding down a nearby hill on our street. Our house, located at the corner of our street, allows us to see everyone passing by and become familiar with the vehicles that frequent our area. Whenever a stranger's car passes by, we tend to take notice. Some of our neighbors go for walks or take their dogs out for exercise. Kids can often be seen riding their bikes and engaging in typical neighborhood activities. Since we work from home, we're often at home, along with my wife and our two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen. As a result, everyone is used to seeing us come and go. We enjoy spending time outside, even on rainy days. Occasionally, we fire up the grill on our back deck, and the delicious smell of barbecue fills the air. The sounds of lawn mowers are a regular occurrence from March to October, when the grass growth slows down. Our neighborhood was originally a wooded area, so we have plenty of trees providing shade, but also a lot of leaves in the fall, which means raking and burning them every year. I enjoy the smell of burning leaves, marking the arrival of fall. Lately, we've been experiencing mild winters, making it feel like an extended fall season. Our garage is located at the back of our house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone knocks, which is a rare occurrence. I like tinkering with my truck or other projects in the garage, and when the doors are open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, the neighborhood is relatively quiet, with some families visiting from out of town during special occasions like Thanksgiving and Christmas. If it weren't a through street, I think our neighborhood would be perfect.",
            "I live in a neighborhood that's smack in the middle of the high desert, where the landscape is dominated by dirt and dust. Unless you've experienced living here, it's hard to grasp the feeling of seeing nothing but brown everywhere you look. It's not until you spot a lawn that you realize the owner must be breaking the bank to keep it looking that way. When I first moved here in the 90s, houses were spread out, but nowadays, it's pretty much the same, with some new additions popping up. The area is slowly transforming into a city, but I suppose that's a trend we see everywhere. On the plus side, the people here are generally friendly, though, just like any city, we have our good and bad sides. I'm surrounded by friendly, older folks, which makes it a nice neighborhood. The shopping scene is pretty basic, with just the usual chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you're looking for something upscale, you'll have to drive a bit. You won't find any Whole Foods or similar stores around here. The main industries in my city seem to be construction, which makes sense, given how undeveloped the area still is, with plenty of open spaces left to build on. That's a bit unsettling, but after living in a big city, I'm not eager to go back. My job is actually in the construction industry – I work as a drywall and T-bar installer. One thing I appreciate about my home is the diverse wildlife. People come to the high desert for its natural beauty, and it's home to unique ecosystems that need protecting. It's essential for human residents to learn about the non-human inhabitants of our environment to live in harmony. My family and I have adapted well to the local wildlife. My three kids are obsessed with lizards and desert bugs, and as I write this, they're outside trying to catch different specimens. As for attractions, we have a few. Victorville is a great place for families to experience the desert, and if you can, plan your visit to coincide with the annual San Bernardino County Fair. The fair offers a great mix of activities and fun in the Victorville style. If you head to nearby Wrightwood, you can see the snow-covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to cap off your visit. If you're interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem, the Victor Valley Museum is a great place to start. It features geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of Victorville's development and industry.",
            "When someone asks me to describe my neighbourhood, I'm pretty sure my answer would be quite unique. Unlike others who might be homeowners with their own life, my situation is a bit different. My neighbourhood is where I'm studying, and the people living in my dorm are like my community. The surrounding campus is part of my neighbourhood as well, but to a lesser extent. Although my neighbourhood is a bit unconventional, it shares some qualities with the typical idea of a neighbourhood. For instance, it has houses, people, shops and parks, just like any normal neighbourhood. Let's start with the \"houses\" that make up my neighbourhood. Before I dive into that, I should clarify the types of houses you can find around here. There are three types: apartments, houses, and dormitory houses. Firstly, the apartments usually have 2-4 people in each room, and there are 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type has about 2 floors, so there are around 20 people living in each building. Next, there are the houses that are available for rent, usually with 2-4 bedrooms. They're mostly occupied by alumni, but there aren't many of them around. Finally, there are the dorm rooms, where you'll find hundreds of students sharing rooms with one other person, except for a few exceptions. It's the most common type of housing in my neighbourhood. Now that we've covered the houses, let's talk about the people. My school values diversity, and it's reflected in my neighbourhood. People from all walks of life and different ages live here. The professional staff live in the houses, while the new students stay in the dorms and the older students in the apartments. Since my school is essentially a self-contained neighbourhood, it has plenty of shops and a single park. The shops offer a mix of food options and the school's own brands of clothing and groceries, so you can get anything you need without leaving. The park is a playground for everyone in the neighbourhood, kept clean and safe by all of us who live here.",
            "Well, after 10 years of living here, I think I can share my experiences with you. When I first moved to this neighborhood, I was pretty sad. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge with my family, and I have to admit, I cried because I missed my old home and friends. But my parents wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for a house, a better high school, and a more comfortable life. As time went by, I started to get used to the new place and made some new friends, but also encountered some not-so-friendly people in school. I didn't really get to know my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his family, and Dennis, who lived right next to us. They're wonderful people whom I consider as a kind of family, and I appreciate them greatly.\n\nI still remember when we went to Mr. Glen's wedding. It was a fun and memorable day, and I'm looking forward to experiencing something similar in the future when I settle down and give my future partner the life they deserve. When Mr. Glen's wife, Ms. Veda, removed her white strap and threw it, I managed to catch it, but unfortunately, I missed catching the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I enjoyed spending time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven't seen her since, but I hope she's doing well and pursuing her dreams.\n\nLiving in this neighborhood can be a bit confusing at times, but with the help of GPS, I've been able to explore it more. I've only ventured out with my friends Kason and Curtis so far, and we used to spend hours playing video games and enjoying life to the fullest. Sometimes I'd visit the park to connect with nature and find some peace. It's amazing how it can calm my mind and soothe my soul. I'd also bring sticks I bought from Home Depot and practice my balance, and sometimes I'd take my wooden sword, the bokken, with me. I love doing what I love and having fun.\n\nWe also have a basketball and tennis court in the neighborhood, although I haven't played tennis or basketball in a while. It's nice to have them available if I ever want to pick up the sport again. My dad taught me and my best friend to play tennis with Mr. Graves, and we always had a great time, even though they made us work hard. But that's what made it so enjoyable. I've had many wonderful experiences in this neighborhood, and there are more stories to share, but these are the ones that stand out to me, and I'm excited to see what the future holds.",
            "My place is literally just a stone's throw away from my college, which is why I'm so fond of living here. I have the luxury of living amidst apartment buildings, some cheap eateries, and a few bars that are fun to hang out at without burning a hole in my pocket. One of the bars just got a new name, and it's a bit pricier, but the quality of service and drinks are decent, and the people there are quite friendly. They're either students or low-income residents, considering the affordable apartment prices. There's a bunch of kids around since the nearby elementary school is within walking distance, but I don't really know my neighbors. They smoke a lot of weed, and the management of my building installed an air freshener right in front of their door, which my boyfriend and I found hilarious - it's almost like they're being mocked. The buildings around me are a bit old-looking, but maybe they've got renovated insides. A bit down the street, there are brand new apartments that look fancy, but I'm not a fan of them. They claim to be high-end but I'm pretty sure they're cheaply built, and the rent is way too steep. I think it's just a rip-off, but I guess since they're close to campus, the management can get away with it. There's a super cheap restaurant just about five minutes from my place that serves paper plates with mostly microwaved food. I also have a gas station right across from it, which, I've heard, isn't a great place to work. However, thanks to some city funds, the road was renovated last summer, and now we have a nice wide sidewalk, decent grass, and a more pleasant atmosphere. My apartment building is pretty shaded with trees, but the management cut a few down, leaving stumps behind. There are way more trees where I live compared to the other side of the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line, and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but just behind it is 43rd street, which isn't as nice. The sidewalks are all crumbled, and the buildings look shabby. There are a lot of trees there too, but I think they're just to hide the state of the buildings. Most of the crime in my area happens at an apartment complex on that street, but I'm not gonna blame just them - it's a problem that affects the whole area. There are apartments across the street from me that have their own share of crime and a rather transient population. Still, I like where I live. It's affordable, and there are plenty of useful amenities nearby, including the university and two bus stops that make it easy for me to get to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighbourhood is a quiet haven, composed of double-storey houses on a cul-de-sac. The homes are spaced out, giving the illusion of being individual houses. However, they all share the same distinct features - a vibrant yellow exterior, crisp white porches, and emerald green metal roofs. While most residents are friendly with one another, not everyone is acquaintances. We often gather at the end of a winding driveway in the evenings, engaging in casual conversations as the neighbourhood kids play with their toys, colour with sidewalk chalk, or fly their kites. It's a refreshing respite from the fast-paced, tech-obsessed world we live in, reminiscent of a bygone era. The scenery is picturesque - rolling fields, towering trees, and a brilliant blue sky dotted with puffy white clouds. Yet, Mother Nature can be unpredictable. This season, we've been plagued by tornado warnings, and for the first time, we heard the eerie sound of actual tornado sirens last night, prompting us to seek shelter. I found myself taking refuge in my bathtub, clutching my smallest dog and essentials, while my bigger dog remained in the living room, anxious and barking. The neighbourhood was eerily quiet, except for the deafening sound of large hail pounding the ground. As the storm passed, the temperature plummeted from 92 to 75 degrees in a matter of minutes. The hail instantly melted upon hitting the scorching pavement. As the skies cleared, the sun peeked through, and a double rainbow appeared. I quickly grabbed my camera to capture the breathtaking scene, eager to share it with my friends and family on Facebook. They, like me, were amazed by the spectacle. The streets remained deserted for another hour before people began returning home from wherever they were when the storm struck. Once again, life returned to normal - dinner was cooking, and mothers and children were outside enjoying the evening. As a transplant from New Hampshire to North Carolina, I've grown fond of the region's distinct southern drawl. My two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment, like everyone else's, may look identical from the outside, but each has its unique character inside. Some are surprisingly compact, leaving me perplexed. I cherish strolling through the expansive field behind my home, making my way to the pond, which, unfortunately, isn't suitable for swimming. I've spotted deer and, in the mornings, I'm serenaded by the deep, melodic song of the giant bullfrog. It's a fantastic place to call home, situated just 40 minutes from the bustling city of Charlotte. Each morning begins with the cheerful sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms, giving our neighbourhood a village-like atmosphere. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that brays in the evening, letting us know he's still there. I feel fortunate to have discovered this hidden gem of a neighbourhood.",
            "It was during my 8th grade year when I moved into this neighbourhood. It took me a while to make friends, but I eventually became close with two guys, one who lives just two houses down and another on the same street. Although neither of them lives here anymore, the memories we made together still linger. The people who were here when I first arrived are still here, for the most part. My neighbourhood is pretty much like any other American suburb. There are plenty of two-storey houses, and on warm days, I can hear the kids playing outside every weekend. Most days are quiet, but you're never left on your own unless you need help. I've ordered several packages online without any issues, and my neighbours are trustworthy. Just a minute or two away from my house is a park where I've spent many happy times. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there with my friends, and it's also where I got one of my worst injuries - a nasty elbow to the nose while playing football. However, the good memories far outweigh the bad. These days, I visit the park with my cousin's kids. They're still young and love playing on the swings and slides. The thought of going to the park always brings back a flood of memories. The neighbourhood is quite diverse, and you can find all sorts of food nearby. Within a one-mile radius, there are Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants, although many people now prefer ordering food through apps like GrubHub and DoorDash. The most popular places are fast food shops, but you can find those just about anywhere. There are also many pizza places. The stores here have everything you could ever need, including multiple dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is a staple in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even run by Indians, catering to those who want to cook homemade Indian food or buy ready-made dishes. All in all, I'm a big fan of my neighbourhood. Seeing the horror stories on social media and news about people's experiences with their neighbours makes me grateful for the ones I have.",
            "My hometown of Johnston is a charming little place that doesn't stand out from the rest of the towns in South Carolina, but it holds a significant influence in the agricultural sector. It proudly claims to be the Peach Capital of the World, a title showcased on the welcoming sign at the town's entrance. The landscape is mainly dominated by vast farmlands of either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't situated in the town center are spaced out, with most being two-story homes featuring metal roofs to combat the scorching summer heat or gray shingles. These homes are often situated away from the main road, allowing for the front fields to be used for farming. In the town center, there's only one traffic light at a four-way intersection. It's here that you'll find the town's few stores. There are three options for quick bites: Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. A pizzeria used to be in operation, but it closed down a while ago. Maxwell and Halford Drug is a small family-owned pharmacy that's surprisingly famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola. Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA for short, is a small and pricey grocery store that's the town's only option. While it's the main grocery store, many residents prefer to travel to the Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville to buy most of their groceries. The most popular store in town, though, is Dollar General, which sells a wide variety of everyday essentials and is always bustling from opening to closing. There's also a small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind community figure who employs two movers to deliver purchased items. Right next door is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a small pet grooming service that offers various services like daycare, boarding, grooming, and more. Both the doctor's office and veterinary clinic are located outside the town center, but they're well-equipped to serve the town's residents. We have a single elementary school, Johnston Elementary School, which serves students up to fifth grade. After that, students move on to middle and high school in the neighboring town. Although there aren't any parks within the town, a new 2.5-acre recreational area is currently under construction to provide families with more opportunities for outings and attract new visitors or residents. Despite its limited attractions, Johnston is a nice place that's so small you could drive right by without even noticing it.",
            "The first time I heard about my place, it was while listening to a podcast about people who went missing. It left a surprising impression on me. Almost every apartment in the area was renting for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story before, and my friends hadn't either. It made me think about the struggles we all face. I know some of my friends struggle to sleep at night because of the costs. Things are expensive, but over time, we've learned to be thrifty. You start to accept the dusty smell of flea market items and worn-out clothes. You notice you smell less in adulthood. You might start smoking or become accustomed to the way things are. However, the flea market always manages to assert itself. The smell of adulthood is the musty smell of old magazines on an old piano, which even washing the piano can't remove. Here, there're three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can visit two charity stores, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curio shop. Downtown is crowded, with cars and people filling the streets every morning, but inside the thrift stores, you'll find silence. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store remains quiet. It's a nice place to spend an afternoon. Every year, the area gets busier, with more cars and people flooding the streets. It's a developing city, they say. As one of the largest e-commerce and delivery empires is headquartered here, it's still dealing with growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone's focused on their goals, and nobody really asks for much. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's different from the South, where showing a little concern means you care. You don't pry into people's lives here; you can keep your shell as long as you like, and the city will move along like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. There's always something going on, whether it's the pianist next door or the two amateur singers upstairs. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. I feel fortunate to live here. I quite like my neighbors, and they treat me well. I try to keep my apartment clean and leave food for them, and they do the same for me. I bring their mail, and they bring mine. It's nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my presence just as much as I do theirs. Despite living in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl, it's my neighbors who make me feel like I haven't ruined my life completely.",
            "My neighborhood is a pretty standard suburban area, with a strong presence of a homeowner's association that maintains the look and feel of the place. As soon as you step in, you'll notice the neatly kept single-family homes, all thanks to the HOA. Every house has a similar front yard with a patch of grass, decorative pebbles, and short driveways. Small trees are scattered around, and everyone has a two-car garage. The roads are also well-maintained, with newly paved concrete and no potholes in sight. The houses are mostly one story, but some have two stories as well. Instead of individual mailboxes, we have a system of shared mailboxes at the end of the street, which requires a key to access. There are also two large lockers for packages - another testament to the HOA's focus on uniformity. Our neighborhood is situated on the outskirts of the nearby city, giving us a mix of rural and suburban vibes. We have plenty of land for everything, including multiple community pools that are well-maintained and gated, and walking trails where you can take your dog or enjoy a peaceful evening stroll. Since most of the community is made up of retired folks, it's a very safe area where everyone looks out for each other. We also have a smaller number of middle-aged and young professionals living here. The nearby city is surprisingly large in terms of population, but it feels like a small town. We have all the amenities you'd expect, including a mall that's not too big but gets the job done. It takes around 15 minutes to drive to significant places, but once you get there, you'll find a variety of stores to choose from, ranging from high-end grocery stores to bargain outlets. Overall, my neighborhood is a safe, well-maintained, and pretty standard place to live, with plenty of nice features like pools and walking trails.",
            "Yesterday, I thought to myself, I really love my little Midwestern town, nestled just outside a bustling city. It's not fancy, but it's home. Our neighborhood on the east side is indeed the most economically challenged area in town, with property values being relatively low. People own or rent houses here, but that's just the way it is. Don't get me wrong, it's not ugly or unpleasant. Everyone in my neighborhood is super friendly. They greet me warmly when I stroll down the street, and we all have a good time chatting. Of course, there's a slightly higher crime rate compared to other parts of town, but we've been lucky so far. I mean, there have been some instances of violence in the past decade, but fortunately, we haven't been directly affected. Our neighbors' son lost his life in a shooting near the local watering hole last year, but we've been fortunate enough to avoid any serious issues like that. The only time we've been affected by crime was when we forgot to bring something inside, and it went missing from our porch. Our town is one of those places that has been hit hard by the opioid epidemic that's sweeping across America. Sadly, many lives have been lost to fentanyl overdoses, but we're fortunate to have plenty of resources to help combat this issue. There are several addiction rehab centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those struggling with addiction.\n\nDespite all this, our town has its bright spots. My son's elementary school is top-notch, with amazing staff from the principal to the teachers and support staff. He's got special needs, but he's never been bullied due to the incredibly positive vibe at school. He loves going there. We have a very active PTO that organizes loads of events throughout the year to get families involved and promote educational progress. Since over 20% of our town's population lives below the poverty line, the school offers free breakfast and lunch to every student, so no child ever goes hungry. No one is looked down upon because they can't pay, and school fees, supplies, and field trips are super reasonable. The City Council and staff have made some great improvements to our town, like fixing roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these upgrades have happened in the center of town and on the west side, where the shopping areas are and most of the traffic passes through. Our side of town tends to get a bit neglected, which is a point of contention for us.\n\nAll in all, I really enjoy living here. People are friendly, the schools are great, and there are plenty of shopping options to meet our needs. Our home might not be worth much, but it's cozy and comfortable. We've been living here for over 16 years, and we can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is a melting pot of diverse cultures, nestled on a hill overlooking a tapestry of historic buildings. I reside in a 7-story apartment complex directly opposite the old theater, with a vibrant arcade bar a short stroll away. This popular hotspot draws in people from all walks of life on warm summer evenings, with long queues forming outside on weekends in June and July. Just a few blocks away lies the local city park, a significant green oasis in the midst of our bustling town. The park is encircled by concrete walls with stairs carved into the structure, providing a cozy abode for the homeless during the cold winter months. They huddle together in neat rows, sheltered from the rain and wind, yet still within walking distance of the local family center where they can access basic amenities like showers and bathing facilities.\n\nWhat I cherish about my neighborhood, however, isn't the grand architecture or the historic charm – it's the people themselves. You see, Hilltop was once notorious for gang violence, and the scars still linger. Even decades later, whispers of federal intervention and DEA crackdowns still circulate among the locals. The community has worked tirelessly to maintain their neighborhood's cleanliness, despite its reputation as one of the rougher areas in the city. They care deeply about their community and its well-being, passing down stories of the past to newcomers like me. A warning often shared among outsiders is that it's not safe to walk the Hill at night if you're white, a stigma that still lingers from the past. I believe this cautionary tale is a product of social conditioning, tainted with the bitter taste of racism and ignorance. Perhaps it's because I've grown accustomed to navigating these complexities, or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of their own – someone who understands the lingering remnants of societal prejudice. Whatever the reason, I know one thing: the Hilltop will always be my home. I feel most alive walking its streets at night, surrounded by people who've offered me kindness and compassion, rather than malice. It's a place where laundromat owners stay open late to help a lost soul, where strangers offer you a jacket on a cold night, and where you're reminded of your worth and beauty in a world that often tries to erase it.",
            "I'm living in Rural America, in the heart of a small town in Michigan. My place is surrounded by farmland and quaint tourist spots, with no massive city malls or big-name stores like Wal-mart, Target, or Applebee's. You need a car to get around here. Despite that, I'm blessed to live in one of the most beautiful spots on earth, flanked by the stunning Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. My hometown is literally surrounded by water, with beaches waiting to be explored. The neighborhood I live in reflects the charm of small-town life. Houses aren't stacked on top of each other like skyscrapers; they're unique, older homes that have been lovingly updated or remodeled over the years. Many of them have basements that can be seen from the road, giving them a cozy, welcoming feel. My neighborhood is a rainbow of colors, with houses sporting every hue imaginable, each one standing out in its own way. Most of these homes have spacious yards, complete with trampolines, playsets, and sometimes even gardens and animal enclosures. It's a quintessential Middle America feel, where families work hard to make a living and raise their kids. On any given day, you'll see kids running up and down the streets, people strolling with their dogs, biking, or rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors, and you can easily spot who fits in and who's a new face. You might catch someone grilling in their yard and wave, or see someone walking their dog from a few blocks away and smile in greeting. The lawns are well-maintained, with neatly trimmed grass and tidy gardens. It's not a picturesque neighborhood that'll leave you awestruck, but it's a place where you'd feel comfortable raising a family. It's quiet, peaceful, and safe. Within walking distance, you'll find the county sheriff's department and jail, the health department, and the local recycling center. We even have baseball and softball fields nearby, where you can hear the announcers calling out the scores and player names. The small-town airport is just a stone's throw away, and you can hear the rumble of small planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream at the local parlor or bike to the nearby park, which is just a short 8 blocks away. It's a fantastic place to call home."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "Lately, I've been living in a bustling city, where the streets are filled with people from all walks of life. My neighborhood is a melting pot, with residential areas scattered among commercial ones. You can find everything from offices to restaurants, stores, and entertainment spots. There are countless new restaurants to try and shops to browse, ranging from big, well-known brands to small, trendy boutiques. These boutiques not only line the malls but also occupy the streets, which are just a short walk from quiet neighborhoods that would otherwise be peaceful. I've noticed that people often visit the nearby parks with their kids, enjoying the fresh air and greenery. The diversity in my neighborhood is quite impressive, with a thriving LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a group of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union all living in the same area. Further afield, there are even more people from different racial and cultural backgrounds, though they often stick together in their own little communities within the city. We have areas like Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia, just a few miles away, but the traffic makes it a pain to get there. Rush hour is especially bad, and it takes a long time to drive short distances. People don't usually walk much in my city, given its size, so the traffic is atrocious, and parking spots are hard to come by. Despite all this, the city is seeing a lot of new construction, with massive apartment buildings going up left and right. While it's great for some, many residents are worried about the added crowds and traffic. My city has a wide range of houses, from single-family homes to apartment buildings and condominiums. It's not all about high-rise apartments; some people prefer to live in smaller, more intimate settings. Even in my own neighborhood, I see a mix of different housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of all ages, and I'm not really familiar with most of my neighbors.

My place has a tiny front yard and a small driveway to the left, pretty typical of the others. It's like stepping back in time, you know? People used to think that living in the suburbs was the ultimate dream, but now it's not as appealing as it used to be. Yet, my neighborhood's still here, still holding onto that dream, and it's like it's calling out to us, reminding us that it's still alive.

            "You might overlook it at first glance, but look closer and you'll discover a whole other world behind the rows of shops and hotels. It's not exactly the kind of place you'd expect to find a community, let alone one that's thriving. But if you venture behind the old Whole Foods, which has long been abandoned, and walk down the road behind the hotels that are only occupied for a short time each summer, you'll stumble upon a bustling neighborhood. Amidst this community are several apartment complexes, situated side by side like a string of carefully placed Russian nesting dolls. The first complex you'll come across has had its fair share of controversy, so we'll skip over that.

The road forks into another residential street, lined with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center on the other, where people recover from unfortunate accidents. The treatment center boasts cheerful outdoor furniture and a lazily spinning ceiling fan that circulates the warm summer air. Children run around in the park, playing tag and cartwheeling in the grass, while bees lazily flit between the flowers by the road. You'll see retirees walking their dogs, scowling at the skateboarders and nodding politely at the teenage girls gossiping by the playground equipment. There's a sushi place in a nearby strip mall with affordable food but always seems to be quiet, alongside a swimming supply store and a nail salon in between. You can fill up your pool for the season while getting a manicure and enjoying some hibachi chicken - the convenience of a strip mall. There's also a frozen yogurt shop where you can add your own toppings, and you often see teenagers in the park clutching cold, sweaty cups of frozen yogurt as they skateboard and vape. This neighborhood is a quintessential slice of Americana, a piece of history in the quiet south where time seems to stand still, unchanged.",
            "As we cruised past the seemingly endless corn fields that stretched as far as the eye could see, she asked, \"Where are we?\" I just smiled knowingly, anticipating the look of shock on her face as she took in the vastness of the open landscape. Coming from a town where the nearby grocery store was just a short 5-minute walk from her front door, she'd never experienced anything like this before. The sheer vastness of the corn fields left her speechless, and I took the opportunity to share with her what it was like growing up in rural Ohio. In that moment, she finally grasped who I was and where I came from.\n\nA two-lane country road led us to a quarry filled with water, followed by the small development where I reside. The houses here are a mix of brick and stucco, each with at least half an acre of land that everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, the area is a kaleidoscope of colors, thanks to the annual flowers and midwestern trees that change with the seasons. You'll also notice the driveways lined with sleek, high-end Mercedes-Benz luxury cars that glisten in the sun after a refreshing wash. As we continued down the road, my neighbor, a friendly Korean man, was out mowing his lawn, singing along to the hum of his John Deere Zero Turn mower. His daily routine brings a smile to everyone's face, and it's not just his cheerful demeanor that makes him special – he's also got a fascinating story to tell.\n\nAs we approached my home, you'd notice the abundance of geese in the side yard, chased by our energetic Terrier. The sound of the nearby stream, bullfrogs, and the occasional moo from the nearby farms created a soothing background melody. Across the handmade wooden bridge lay an untouched oasis, teeming with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was where I spent most of my childhood, building tree forts, 'hunting' animals (which mostly involved chasing them), and making lifelong friends with the other neighborhood kids. Winters in my small town could be harsh, but there was something magical about the transformation. The once lush green yard would turn into an empty wilderness, with bare trees and the occasional snowfall turning it into a winter wonderland overnight. My little sister and I would spend hours making snow angels, building snowmen, and engaging in epic snowball fights. We'd construct massive igloo-like forts, armed with branches, to house our arsenal of snowballs. In that winter wonderland, we were carefree kids, with nothing but the joy of childhood to worry about.",
            "The starting point for any visitor to Portland, Oregon, is to understand what it means to be \"weird\". A sign on the back of a building that serves as a multifaceted hub - a pizza joint, bar, music venue, and more - proudly displays the town's unofficial slogan: \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this phrase is a nostalgic reminder of the city's past, a time when it was less well-known and less expensive, fostering a unique cultural landscape. To others, it's an invitation to come and experience a place where being considered \"weird\" is a badge of honour. Despite an influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of new condominiums, Portland remains an unconventional city. \"Weird\" does not imply a complete rejection of modernity, but rather a willingness to accept the unconventional and the unusual. Like many cities, we consume many of our goods from China. However, Portland has its own brand of normalcy, with yoga enthusiasts, hipsters, and business professionals coexisting with a more eclectic crowd. Perhaps what makes Portland unique is its carefree attitude towards these contrasts. In my own neighbourhood, as with many in Portland, you'll find vibrant houses, lush home gardens, and in the summertime, free boxes lining the streets. Free boxes can contain anything - clothes, books, or even household items - and they're a treasure trove waiting to be discovered. The magic of stumbling upon a hidden gem in a Southeast Portland neighbourhood is what makes this city so special. To me, that's what Portland is all about, but I'm just one of many individuals who call this city home. Some of my neighbours would never dream of rummaging through a free box for second-hand items. Instead, they might attend goat yoga or a Portland Timbers match. What's remarkable about this city is the diversity of interests and passions that its residents possess. We're a city of dreamers, both those who are actively pursuing their passions and those who are still daydreaming about them, often over a drink at a local bar. Of course, like many cities, Portland struggles with substance abuse issues, which often stem from deeper mental health problems. The city's signature grey skies and constant rain may also contribute to this issue. Additionally, Portland faces a homelessness crisis, which is a challenge that many cities grapple with. While we offer better social services than some other parts of the country, they're still insufficient. The general public is torn between sympathy and frustration towards the homeless population. In this regard, Portland is not so weird after all.",
            "The mountains have always stood tall, a constant presence in the north, silently witnessing the dawn and dusk of each day. Unfazed by the turmoil of life, their steadfastness is a comforting reminder, especially when I'm consumed by stress and anxiety. It's as if they beckon me to come closer, offering a respite for my weary soul. I first laid eyes on them when I started my undergrad, and they've held a special place in my heart ever since. While the university has its own share of breathtaking spots, the mountains are the true crown jewel. The rest of the town has its own charm, with quaint cafes and old buildings that exude an air of history. Yet, it's the mountains that draw me in, their rugged grandeur a stark contrast to the bustling downtown area. The town's duality is a fascinating aspect - from the vibrant high street to the serene library, each area has its unique character. It's this contrast that makes the town so captivating, as if it's inviting me to explore and create memories. Whether it's strolling through the park with friends or racing through the downtown streets to catch the latest movie, every part of town holds a special place in my heart. However, it's also a place where painful memories reside, much like anywhere else in life. The ponds, in particular, have been a sanctuary for me, a place to reflect and cry during the darkest moments. As I watched the turtles and ducks living their lives, I couldn't help but ponder my own purpose and the mysteries of life. I'd walk past the pond, the park, and the houses, until I reached the main street, where the sun would paint the sky with its vibrant hues. And as I looked up at the sunrise, I'd realize I was walking north, drawn to the mountains that stood tall, a constant reminder of my determination.",
            "If you're planning a trip to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, don't worry - you'll have no issue finding it. The area is well-connected to public transportation, which is one of the most popular ways to get around New York City. Bensonhurst itself is an urban neighborhood, offering the hustle and bustle of the city. When exploring, you'll notice a plethora of Asian stores scattered throughout the area. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurst has seen a significant influx of Asian residents, resulting in an abundance of Asian-owned businesses - at least one per block. You'll likely find yourself surrounded by Asian-owned supermarkets and laundromats. These businesses are extremely popular among locals, offering top-notch food, affordable prices, and unparalleled convenience. I'm lucky enough to be close to four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walking distance from each other. This convenience makes accessing grocery shopping a breeze. While Bensonhurst isn't exclusively occupied by Asian residents, the area is culturally diverse, with immigrants and their children from various generations calling it home.\n\nMajority-owned businesses in the area are Asian-owned, but you'll also find a beautifully renovated park nearby, boasting over ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy in the summer. As you're in the heart of New York City, expect to see an array of diversity in the park, with people from all walks of life getting along harmoniously. Unlike other areas in the city, Bensonhurst doesn't have large corporate buildings; instead, you'll find co-op living spaces and condominium apartments. The majority of the living spaces are two-family houses. The locals are generally nice but can be a bit rowdy. Be prepared for loud cars blasting music as you walk by or people flooring their gas in the morning, which might wake you up. If you're planning a nighttime visit, be cautious - the neighborhood is generally safe, but you might encounter people looking for trouble or bullies. I've personally experienced bullying in the past, but it was a long time ago. More recently, there have been incidents of package theft. While it's a common issue elsewhere, package thieves do exist in Bensonhurst. One of my pet peeves is the lack of cleanliness in the neighborhood - specifically, dog waste everywhere. Be mindful of your surroundings, especially in the mornings, and keep your shoes clean!",
            "I live in a place with very limited sidewalks. Our house sits at the top of a steep hill in the neighborhood, which makes it a great spot for joggers to get a good workout. They often refer to it as the \"workout hill.\" Since there are no sidewalks on my street, everyone has to walk on the road, which can be a bit hazardous due to potholes and uneven surfaces. The telephone and electric wires surrounding my neighborhood are often in disrepair, with tattered-looking cables and patchwork repairs from frequent storm damage. We get a lot of rain and storms here, which causes branches and debris to fall on the power lines. \n\nThe area is surrounded by tall evergreen trees, but people around here aren't fans of them. They try to cut them down as much as possible because they block the view of the ocean. As a result, many houses are built high up on the hill with large glass windows to take in the view of the bay. It's beautiful during sunset when the water below is lit up and the sky turns orange. However, most days are overcast and cloudy, making it hard to see the sunlight clearly. Moss grows everywhere, from roofs to cars to railings, due to the constant dampness. I once left my car outside for a month, and when I returned, it was covered in moss and took me hours to clean off. The neighborhood is mostly made up of older residents, with many retirees. We don't have many kids around, but there's a school not far away. Instead of kids, we have a lot of dogs running around. They often sit in front of houses or chase each other down the street. If you leave a door or window open, they might sneak in. I once found one in my living room and had to shoo it out. Rabbits are also common in our area, and they can cause problems for gardeners by digging up plant roots and burrowing into lawns. However, my cats love them and have managed to hunt most of them out of our neighborhood. We also have a variety of birds, including small sparrows, hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle that gets chased off by the neighborhood crows. If you're willing to hike down to the waterfront, there are some restaurants that serve fresh seafood, but the beach itself is small and not very wide. You can still see the opposite shoreline clearly even on misty days.",
            "I live in a typical suburban area in a small town in the southern part of Tennessee. Our street is a connecting route between two state highways, resulting in a moderate amount of traffic, which I don't always enjoy. However, the neighborhood remains relatively quiet, with not too many people moving in and out. I've grown accustomed to the familiar faces that live around here. Most residents spend their days tending to their yards and other daily tasks. In the winter, we enjoy sledding down a nearby hill on our street. Our house, located at the corner of our street, allows us to see everyone passing by and become familiar with the vehicles that frequent our area. Whenever a stranger's car passes by, we tend to take notice. Some of our neighbors go for walks or take their dogs out for exercise. Kids can often be seen riding their bikes and engaging in typical neighborhood activities. Since we work from home, we're often at home, along with my wife and our two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen. As a result, everyone is used to seeing us come and go. We enjoy spending time outside, even on rainy days. Occasionally, we fire up the grill on our back deck, and the delicious smell of barbecue fills the air. The sounds of lawn mowers are a regular occurrence from March to October, when the grass growth slows down. Our neighborhood was originally a wooded area, so we have plenty of trees providing shade, but also a lot of leaves in the fall, which means raking and burning them every year. I enjoy the smell of burning leaves, marking the arrival of fall. Lately, we've been experiencing mild winters, making it feel like an extended fall season. Our garage is located at the back of our house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone knocks, which is a rare occurrence. I like tinkering with my truck or other projects in the garage, and when the doors are open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, the neighborhood is relatively quiet, with some families visiting from out of town during special occasions like Thanksgiving and Christmas. If it weren't a through street, I think our neighborhood would be perfect.",
            "I live in a neighborhood that's smack in the middle of the high desert, where the landscape is dominated by dirt and dust. Unless you've experienced living here, it's hard to grasp the feeling of seeing nothing but brown everywhere you look. It's not until you spot a lawn that you realize the owner must be breaking the bank to keep it looking that way. When I first moved here in the 90s, houses were spread out, but nowadays, it's pretty much the same, with some new additions popping up. The area is slowly transforming into a city, but I suppose that's a trend we see everywhere. On the plus side, the people here are generally friendly, though, just like any city, we have our good and bad sides. I'm surrounded by friendly, older folks, which makes it a nice neighborhood. The shopping scene is pretty basic, with just the usual chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you're looking for something upscale, you'll have to drive a bit. You won't find any Whole Foods or similar stores around here. The main industries in my city seem to be construction, which makes sense, given how undeveloped the area still is, with plenty of open spaces left to build on. That's a bit unsettling, but after living in a big city, I'm not eager to go back. My job is actually in the construction industry – I work as a drywall and T-bar installer. One thing I appreciate about my home is the diverse wildlife. People come to the high desert for its natural beauty, and it's home to unique ecosystems that need protecting. It's essential for human residents to learn about the non-human inhabitants of our environment to live in harmony. My family and I have adapted well to the local wildlife. My three kids are obsessed with lizards and desert bugs, and as I write this, they're outside trying to catch different specimens. As for attractions, we have a few. Victorville is a great place for families to experience the desert, and if you can, plan your visit to coincide with the annual San Bernardino County Fair. The fair offers a great mix of activities and fun in the Victorville style. If you head to nearby Wrightwood, you can see the snow-covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to cap off your visit. If you're interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem, the Victor Valley Museum is a great place to start. It features geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of Victorville's development and industry.",
            "When someone asks me to describe my neighbourhood, I'm pretty sure my answer would be quite unique. Unlike others who might be homeowners with their own life, my situation is a bit different. My neighbourhood is where I'm studying, and the people living in my dorm are like my community. The surrounding campus is part of my neighbourhood as well, but to a lesser extent. Although my neighbourhood is a bit unconventional, it shares some qualities with the typical idea of a neighbourhood. For instance, it has houses, people, shops and parks, just like any normal neighbourhood. Let's start with the \"houses\" that make up my neighbourhood. Before I dive into that, I should clarify the types of houses you can find around here. There are three types: apartments, houses, and dormitory houses. Firstly, the apartments usually have 2-4 people in each room, and there are 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type has about 2 floors, so there are around 20 people living in each building. Next, there are the houses that are available for rent, usually with 2-4 bedrooms. They're mostly occupied by alumni, but there aren't many of them around. Finally, there are the dorm rooms, where you'll find hundreds of students sharing rooms with one other person, except for a few exceptions. It's the most common type of housing in my neighbourhood. Now that we've covered the houses, let's talk about the people. My school values diversity, and it's reflected in my neighbourhood. People from all walks of life and different ages live here. The professional staff live in the houses, while the new students stay in the dorms and the older students in the apartments. Since my school is essentially a self-contained neighbourhood, it has plenty of shops and a single park. The shops offer a mix of food options and the school's own brands of clothing and groceries, so you can get anything you need without leaving. The park is a playground for everyone in the neighbourhood, kept clean and safe by all of us who live here.",
            "Well, after 10 years of living here, I think I can share my experiences with you. When I first moved to this neighborhood, I was pretty sad. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge with my family, and I have to admit, I cried because I missed my old home and friends. But my parents wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for a house, a better high school, and a more comfortable life. As time went by, I started to get used to the new place and made some new friends, but also encountered some not-so-friendly people in school. I didn't really get to know my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his family, and Dennis, who lived right next to us. They're wonderful people whom I consider as a kind of family, and I appreciate them greatly.\n\nI still remember when we went to Mr. Glen's wedding. It was a fun and memorable day, and I'm looking forward to experiencing something similar in the future when I settle down and give my future partner the life they deserve. When Mr. Glen's wife, Ms. Veda, removed her white strap and threw it, I managed to catch it, but unfortunately, I missed catching the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I enjoyed spending time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven't seen her since, but I hope she's doing well and pursuing her dreams.\n\nLiving in this neighborhood can be a bit confusing at times, but with the help of GPS, I've been able to explore it more. I've only ventured out with my friends Kason and Curtis so far, and we used to spend hours playing video games and enjoying life to the fullest. Sometimes I'd visit the park to connect with nature and find some peace. It's amazing how it can calm my mind and soothe my soul. I'd also bring sticks I bought from Home Depot and practice my balance, and sometimes I'd take my wooden sword, the bokken, with me. I love doing what I love and having fun.\n\nWe also have a basketball and tennis court in the neighborhood, although I haven't played tennis or basketball in a while. It's nice to have them available if I ever want to pick up the sport again. My dad taught me and my best friend to play tennis with Mr. Graves, and we always had a great time, even though they made us work hard. But that's what made it so enjoyable. I've had many wonderful experiences in this neighborhood, and there are more stories to share, but these are the ones that stand out to me, and I'm excited to see what the future holds.",
            "My place is literally just a stone's throw away from my college, which is why I'm so fond of living here. I have the luxury of living amidst apartment buildings, some cheap eateries, and a few bars that are fun to hang out at without burning a hole in my pocket. One of the bars just got a new name, and it's a bit pricier, but the quality of service and drinks are decent, and the people there are quite friendly. They're either students or low-income residents, considering the affordable apartment prices. There's a bunch of kids around since the nearby elementary school is within walking distance, but I don't really know my neighbors. They smoke a lot of weed, and the management of my building installed an air freshener right in front of their door, which my boyfriend and I found hilarious - it's almost like they're being mocked. The buildings around me are a bit old-looking, but maybe they've got renovated insides. A bit down the street, there are brand new apartments that look fancy, but I'm not a fan of them. They claim to be high-end but I'm pretty sure they're cheaply built, and the rent is way too steep. I think it's just a rip-off, but I guess since they're close to campus, the management can get away with it. There's a super cheap restaurant just about five minutes from my place that serves paper plates with mostly microwaved food. I also have a gas station right across from it, which, I've heard, isn't a great place to work. However, thanks to some city funds, the road was renovated last summer, and now we have a nice wide sidewalk, decent grass, and a more pleasant atmosphere. My apartment building is pretty shaded with trees, but the management cut a few down, leaving stumps behind. There are way more trees where I live compared to the other side of the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line, and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but just behind it is 43rd street, which isn't as nice. The sidewalks are all crumbled, and the buildings look shabby. There are a lot of trees there too, but I think they're just to hide the state of the buildings. Most of the crime in my area happens at an apartment complex on that street, but I'm not gonna blame just them - it's a problem that affects the whole area. There are apartments across the street from me that have their own share of crime and a rather transient population. Still, I like where I live. It's affordable, and there are plenty of useful amenities nearby, including the university and two bus stops that make it easy for me to get to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighbourhood is a quiet haven, composed of double-storey houses on a cul-de-sac. The homes are spaced out, giving the illusion of being individual houses. However, they all share the same distinct features - a vibrant yellow exterior, crisp white porches, and emerald green metal roofs. While most residents are friendly with one another, not everyone is acquaintances. We often gather at the end of a winding driveway in the evenings, engaging in casual conversations as the neighbourhood kids play with their toys, colour with sidewalk chalk, or fly their kites. It's a refreshing respite from the fast-paced, tech-obsessed world we live in, reminiscent of a bygone era. The scenery is picturesque - rolling fields, towering trees, and a brilliant blue sky dotted with puffy white clouds. Yet, Mother Nature can be unpredictable. This season, we've been plagued by tornado warnings, and for the first time, we heard the eerie sound of actual tornado sirens last night, prompting us to seek shelter. I found myself taking refuge in my bathtub, clutching my smallest dog and essentials, while my bigger dog remained in the living room, anxious and barking. The neighbourhood was eerily quiet, except for the deafening sound of large hail pounding the ground. As the storm passed, the temperature plummeted from 92 to 75 degrees in a matter of minutes. The hail instantly melted upon hitting the scorching pavement. As the skies cleared, the sun peeked through, and a double rainbow appeared. I quickly grabbed my camera to capture the breathtaking scene, eager to share it with my friends and family on Facebook. They, like me, were amazed by the spectacle. The streets remained deserted for another hour before people began returning home from wherever they were when the storm struck. Once again, life returned to normal - dinner was cooking, and mothers and children were outside enjoying the evening. As a transplant from New Hampshire to North Carolina, I've grown fond of the region's distinct southern drawl. My two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment, like everyone else's, may look identical from the outside, but each has its unique character inside. Some are surprisingly compact, leaving me perplexed. I cherish strolling through the expansive field behind my home, making my way to the pond, which, unfortunately, isn't suitable for swimming. I've spotted deer and, in the mornings, I'm serenaded by the deep, melodic song of the giant bullfrog. It's a fantastic place to call home, situated just 40 minutes from the bustling city of Charlotte. Each morning begins with the cheerful sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms, giving our neighbourhood a village-like atmosphere. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that brays in the evening, letting us know he's still there. I feel fortunate to have discovered this hidden gem of a neighbourhood.",
            "It was during my 8th grade year when I moved into this neighbourhood. It took me a while to make friends, but I eventually became close with two guys, one who lives just two houses down and another on the same street. Although neither of them lives here anymore, the memories we made together still linger. The people who were here when I first arrived are still here, for the most part. My neighbourhood is pretty much like any other American suburb. There are plenty of two-storey houses, and on warm days, I can hear the kids playing outside every weekend. Most days are quiet, but you're never left on your own unless you need help. I've ordered several packages online without any issues, and my neighbours are trustworthy. Just a minute or two away from my house is a park where I've spent many happy times. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there with my friends, and it's also where I got one of my worst injuries - a nasty elbow to the nose while playing football. However, the good memories far outweigh the bad. These days, I visit the park with my cousin's kids. They're still young and love playing on the swings and slides. The thought of going to the park always brings back a flood of memories. The neighbourhood is quite diverse, and you can find all sorts of food nearby. Within a one-mile radius, there are Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants, although many people now prefer ordering food through apps like GrubHub and DoorDash. The most popular places are fast food shops, but you can find those just about anywhere. There are also many pizza places. The stores here have everything you could ever need, including multiple dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is a staple in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even run by Indians, catering to those who want to cook homemade Indian food or buy ready-made dishes. All in all, I'm a big fan of my neighbourhood. Seeing the horror stories on social media and news about people's experiences with their neighbours makes me grateful for the ones I have.",
            "My hometown of Johnston is a charming little place that doesn't stand out from the rest of the towns in South Carolina, but it holds a significant influence in the agricultural sector. It proudly claims to be the Peach Capital of the World, a title showcased on the welcoming sign at the town's entrance. The landscape is mainly dominated by vast farmlands of either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't situated in the town center are spaced out, with most being two-story homes featuring metal roofs to combat the scorching summer heat or gray shingles. These homes are often situated away from the main road, allowing for the front fields to be used for farming. In the town center, there's only one traffic light at a four-way intersection. It's here that you'll find the town's few stores. There are three options for quick bites: Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. A pizzeria used to be in operation, but it closed down a while ago. Maxwell and Halford Drug is a small family-owned pharmacy that's surprisingly famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola. Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA for short, is a small and pricey grocery store that's the town's only option. While it's the main grocery store, many residents prefer to travel to the Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville to buy most of their groceries. The most popular store in town, though, is Dollar General, which sells a wide variety of everyday essentials and is always bustling from opening to closing. There's also a small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind community figure who employs two movers to deliver purchased items. Right next door is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a small pet grooming service that offers various services like daycare, boarding, grooming, and more. Both the doctor's office and veterinary clinic are located outside the town center, but they're well-equipped to serve the town's residents. We have a single elementary school, Johnston Elementary School, which serves students up to fifth grade. After that, students move on to middle and high school in the neighboring town. Although there aren't any parks within the town, a new 2.5-acre recreational area is currently under construction to provide families with more opportunities for outings and attract new visitors or residents. Despite its limited attractions, Johnston is a nice place that's so small you could drive right by without even noticing it.",
            "The first time I heard about my place, it was while listening to a podcast about people who went missing. It left a surprising impression on me. Almost every apartment in the area was renting for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story before, and my friends hadn't either. It made me think about the struggles we all face. I know some of my friends struggle to sleep at night because of the costs. Things are expensive, but over time, we've learned to be thrifty. You start to accept the dusty smell of flea market items and worn-out clothes. You notice you smell less in adulthood. You might start smoking or become accustomed to the way things are. However, the flea market always manages to assert itself. The smell of adulthood is the musty smell of old magazines on an old piano, which even washing the piano can't remove. Here, there're three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can visit two charity stores, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curio shop. Downtown is crowded, with cars and people filling the streets every morning, but inside the thrift stores, you'll find silence. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store remains quiet. It's a nice place to spend an afternoon. Every year, the area gets busier, with more cars and people flooding the streets. It's a developing city, they say. As one of the largest e-commerce and delivery empires is headquartered here, it's still dealing with growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone's focused on their goals, and nobody really asks for much. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's different from the South, where showing a little concern means you care. You don't pry into people's lives here; you can keep your shell as long as you like, and the city will move along like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. There's always something going on, whether it's the pianist next door or the two amateur singers upstairs. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. I feel fortunate to live here. I quite like my neighbors, and they treat me well. I try to keep my apartment clean and leave food for them, and they do the same for me. I bring their mail, and they bring mine. It's nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my presence just as much as I do theirs. Despite living in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl, it's my neighbors who make me feel like I haven't ruined my life completely.",
            "My neighborhood is a pretty standard suburban area, with a strong presence of a homeowner's association that maintains the look and feel of the place. As soon as you step in, you'll notice the neatly kept single-family homes, all thanks to the HOA. Every house has a similar front yard with a patch of grass, decorative pebbles, and short driveways. Small trees are scattered around, and everyone has a two-car garage. The roads are also well-maintained, with newly paved concrete and no potholes in sight. The houses are mostly one story, but some have two stories as well. Instead of individual mailboxes, we have a system of shared mailboxes at the end of the street, which requires a key to access. There are also two large lockers for packages - another testament to the HOA's focus on uniformity. Our neighborhood is situated on the outskirts of the nearby city, giving us a mix of rural and suburban vibes. We have plenty of land for everything, including multiple community pools that are well-maintained and gated, and walking trails where you can take your dog or enjoy a peaceful evening stroll. Since most of the community is made up of retired folks, it's a very safe area where everyone looks out for each other. We also have a smaller number of middle-aged and young professionals living here. The nearby city is surprisingly large in terms of population, but it feels like a small town. We have all the amenities you'd expect, including a mall that's not too big but gets the job done. It takes around 15 minutes to drive to significant places, but once you get there, you'll find a variety of stores to choose from, ranging from high-end grocery stores to bargain outlets. Overall, my neighborhood is a safe, well-maintained, and pretty standard place to live, with plenty of nice features like pools and walking trails.",
            "Yesterday, I thought to myself, I really love my little Midwestern town, nestled just outside a bustling city. It's not fancy, but it's home. Our neighborhood on the east side is indeed the most economically challenged area in town, with property values being relatively low. People own or rent houses here, but that's just the way it is. Don't get me wrong, it's not ugly or unpleasant. Everyone in my neighborhood is super friendly. They greet me warmly when I stroll down the street, and we all have a good time chatting. Of course, there's a slightly higher crime rate compared to other parts of town, but we've been lucky so far. I mean, there have been some instances of violence in the past decade, but fortunately, we haven't been directly affected. Our neighbors' son lost his life in a shooting near the local watering hole last year, but we've been fortunate enough to avoid any serious issues like that. The only time we've been affected by crime was when we forgot to bring something inside, and it went missing from our porch. Our town is one of those places that has been hit hard by the opioid epidemic that's sweeping across America. Sadly, many lives have been lost to fentanyl overdoses, but we're fortunate to have plenty of resources to help combat this issue. There are several addiction rehab centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those struggling with addiction.\n\nDespite all this, our town has its bright spots. My son's elementary school is top-notch, with amazing staff from the principal to the teachers and support staff. He's got special needs, but he's never been bullied due to the incredibly positive vibe at school. He loves going there. We have a very active PTO that organizes loads of events throughout the year to get families involved and promote educational progress. Since over 20% of our town's population lives below the poverty line, the school offers free breakfast and lunch to every student, so no child ever goes hungry. No one is looked down upon because they can't pay, and school fees, supplies, and field trips are super reasonable. The City Council and staff have made some great improvements to our town, like fixing roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these upgrades have happened in the center of town and on the west side, where the shopping areas are and most of the traffic passes through. Our side of town tends to get a bit neglected, which is a point of contention for us.\n\nAll in all, I really enjoy living here. People are friendly, the schools are great, and there are plenty of shopping options to meet our needs. Our home might not be worth much, but it's cozy and comfortable. We've been living here for over 16 years, and we can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is a melting pot of diverse cultures, nestled on a hill overlooking a tapestry of historic buildings. I reside in a 7-story apartment complex directly opposite the old theater, with a vibrant arcade bar a short stroll away. This popular hotspot draws in people from all walks of life on warm summer evenings, with long queues forming outside on weekends in June and July. Just a few blocks away lies the local city park, a significant green oasis in the midst of our bustling town. The park is encircled by concrete walls with stairs carved into the structure, providing a cozy abode for the homeless during the cold winter months. They huddle together in neat rows, sheltered from the rain and wind, yet still within walking distance of the local family center where they can access basic amenities like showers and bathing facilities.\n\nWhat I cherish about my neighborhood, however, isn't the grand architecture or the historic charm – it's the people themselves. You see, Hilltop was once notorious for gang violence, and the scars still linger. Even decades later, whispers of federal intervention and DEA crackdowns still circulate among the locals. The community has worked tirelessly to maintain their neighborhood's cleanliness, despite its reputation as one of the rougher areas in the city. They care deeply about their community and its well-being, passing down stories of the past to newcomers like me. A warning often shared among outsiders is that it's not safe to walk the Hill at night if you're white, a stigma that still lingers from the past. I believe this cautionary tale is a product of social conditioning, tainted with the bitter taste of racism and ignorance. Perhaps it's because I've grown accustomed to navigating these complexities, or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of their own – someone who understands the lingering remnants of societal prejudice. Whatever the reason, I know one thing: the Hilltop will always be my home. I feel most alive walking its streets at night, surrounded by people who've offered me kindness and compassion, rather than malice. It's a place where laundromat owners stay open late to help a lost soul, where strangers offer you a jacket on a cold night, and where you're reminded of your worth and beauty in a world that often tries to erase it.",
            "I'm living in Rural America, in the heart of a small town in Michigan. My place is surrounded by farmland and quaint tourist spots, with no massive city malls or big-name stores like Wal-mart, Target, or Applebee's. You need a car to get around here. Despite that, I'm blessed to live in one of the most beautiful spots on earth, flanked by the stunning Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. My hometown is literally surrounded by water, with beaches waiting to be explored. The neighborhood I live in reflects the charm of small-town life. Houses aren't stacked on top of each other like skyscrapers; they're unique, older homes that have been lovingly updated or remodeled over the years. Many of them have basements that can be seen from the road, giving them a cozy, welcoming feel. My neighborhood is a rainbow of colors, with houses sporting every hue imaginable, each one standing out in its own way. Most of these homes have spacious yards, complete with trampolines, playsets, and sometimes even gardens and animal enclosures. It's a quintessential Middle America feel, where families work hard to make a living and raise their kids. On any given day, you'll see kids running up and down the streets, people strolling with their dogs, biking, or rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors, and you can easily spot who fits in and who's a new face. You might catch someone grilling in their yard and wave, or see someone walking their dog from a few blocks away and smile in greeting. The lawns are well-maintained, with neatly trimmed grass and tidy gardens. It's not a picturesque neighborhood that'll leave you awestruck, but it's a place where you'd feel comfortable raising a family. It's quiet, peaceful, and safe. Within walking distance, you'll find the county sheriff's department and jail, the health department, and the local recycling center. We even have baseball and softball fields nearby, where you can hear the announcers calling out the scores and player names. The small-town airport is just a stone's throw away, and you can hear the rumble of small planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream at the local parlor or bike to the nearby park, which is just a short 8 blocks away. It's a fantastic place to call home."
