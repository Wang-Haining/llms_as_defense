            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

Most of the homes here are single-family dwellings, but there are a few that have been divided into two separate units, while still sharing a common wall.

It's a nostalgic sight, reminiscent of a time not so long ago when the suburbs were the epitome of the American dream. Although that dream has lost its allure for some, my neighborhood remains a testament to its enduring appeal. The people here don't radiate the same optimism they once did, and the upkeep of the lawns has suffered, but there are still cars parked in every driveway, and the youth still play with abandon, as if nothing's changed.

            "At first glance, this place may not seem like much - a residential area behind a shopping strip that's easy to overlook. It's not the kind of place that jumps out at you as having much to offer. But, if you take a walk behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and head back behind the hotels that are only occupied for part of the year, you'll stumble upon a thriving community. The streets here are lined with a row of apartment complexes, each one carefully situated next to the others like a series of connected puzzle pieces.

The iron gates creak open to let them in, while commuters behind the wheel mutter and shake their fists in frustration when they get stuck behind them. Further down the road, another residential street intersects, lined with a park and a rehabilitation center for people with broken bones. The treatment center has a cheerful, welcoming atmosphere, with a lazy ceiling fan spinning gently above and a porch full of furniture.

            "As we cruised down the winding road lined with endless cornfields, my friend gazed out at the seemingly endless landscape. \"Where are we?\" she asked, taken aback by the vast open spaces. I smiled knowingly, anticipating her shock at the stark difference from the bustling town she was used to, where the grocery store was just a stone's throw away from her doorstep. Growing up in a small town in rural Ohio, I was familiar with this kind of scenery, and I shared my own experiences with her. In that moment, she finally grasped who I was and where I came from.\n\nAs we continued down the two-lane road, a tranquil quarry came into view, its calm waters reflecting the sky above. Just beyond it lay the quaint development where I lived, a collection of brick and stucco homes that each boasted a generous half-acre plot, lovingly tended by their owners. During spring, vibrant flowers bloomed alongside the region's iconic midwestern trees, their changing leaves a constant reminder of the passing seasons. The driveways were a sight to behold, lined with sleek Mercedes-Benz luxury cars that glistened in the sunlight after a refreshing wash. My friendly Korean neighbor, a constant presence in our community, could often be found tending to his lawn, his cheerful humming a stark contrast to the whirring of his John Deere mower.\n\nAs we approached my home, a grey stucco house nestled among the trees, the sounds of the outdoors grew louder – the occasional honk of a goose, the chirping of birds, and the soothing hum of the nearby stream. The Terrier, ever vigilant, chased after the geese in the side yard, while the bullfrogs and the occasional \"moo\" from the nearby farms added to the symphony of sounds. A handmade wooden bridge spanned the small stream, leading to a hidden oasis teeming with wildflowers, herbs, and naturally growing trees – a sanctuary where I spent countless hours as a child. From building tree forts to \"hunting\" animals (which mostly involved chasing them), there was never a dull moment, and I was always surrounded by friends from the neighborhood.\n\nIn the harsh winters, our small town transformed into a winter wonderland. The once-vibrant trees stood bare, their branches etched against the grey sky like skeletal fingers. But when snow fell, the backyard was transformed into a magical landscape of snow angels and snowmen, crafted by my mischievous little sister and me. We'd engage in fierce snowball fights, our arsenal of branches and sticks at the ready, and construct elaborate forts to house our winter wonderland. In those carefree days, nothing else mattered – just the joy of childhood, untainted by the complexities of adulthood.",
            "You gotta understand what being \"weird\" means in Portland, Oregon. The unofficial town motto, scribbled on a building that's a pizza joint, bar, music venue, and strip club all rolled into one, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, it's a nostalgic call to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a time when the city was less known, less expensive, and birthed unique subcultures. Others see it as a welcoming invitation - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but this time as a compliment. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the never-ending construction of new condos to house them, Portland remains weird. Being weird doesn't mean we're always accepting, but it does mean we're open to things that others might not be. We're not a place without modern conveniences or modern problems - we buy most of our stuff from China, just like everyone else. Being weird can mean a million different things, but in Portland, there's also plenty of normalcy. We have yoga, hipsters, and suits, just like any other city. Maybe weird just means we don't take ourselves too seriously. In my neighborhood, it's not uncommon to see colorful houses, home gardens overflowing with flowers, herbs, and veggies, and free boxes lining the streets in the summer. Free boxes contain all sorts of treasures - clothes, books, or anything else someone's getting rid of. Sometimes, they're magical, containing just the thing you need. That's what Portland is all about to me - the thrill of discovering something amazing on a random walk through a Southeast Portland neighborhood. Of course, I'm just one of the many weirdos who call this city home. Some of my neighbors would never be caught dead rummaging through a free box on the sidewalk. They'd rather go to goat yoga or catch a Timbers game (that's the city's soccer team). Portland's full of people who love all sorts of things, from unusual hobbies to wild ambitions. We're a city of dreamers, and dreamers who spend way too much time at the bar. Yes, we have problems with substance abuse, which often stem from deeper mental health issues. And yeah, the constant rain and grey skies don't exactly help. We also have a homelessness problem, which no one seems to know how to tackle. The homeless population is drawn by the social services we offer, but they're just not enough. Our non-homeless residents are torn between sympathy and frustration. In this, we're not so weird after all.",
            "The mountains have been steadfast companions, silently bearing witness to the sun's daily rituals of dawn and dusk. Unchanging and unwavering, they remain unaffected by life's turmoil and tribulations. On days when I'm overwhelmed and stressed, they beckon me to pause and take in their serene beauty, lending me the strength to carry on, one day at a time. I first fell under their spell when I began my university journey, and the mountains north of campus have held a special place in my heart ever since. While the university grounds have their own charms, from the striking buildings to the picturesque ponds and trees, it's the mountains that truly command my affection. The rest of the town is equally captivating, with its numerous cafes that have been the backdrop for countless hours of late-night studying fueled by caffeine. I cherish the memories of strolling or taking the bus to downtown, surrounded by the faded grandeur of old buildings, which blends seamlessly with the vibrant energy of the urban city. Yet, it's easy to retreat from the bustle and return to the tranquil atmosphere of the small town by simply walking past the library. This juxtaposition of contrasting atmospheres has created a unique sense of wonder, as if the town is constantly inviting me to explore its depths. Every memory I've created, whether it's sharing laughter with friends under the rusted swings in the park or rushing through downtown to catch a movie, is tied to a specific part of town. The ponds, however, hold a special significance - they've been a sanctuary for reflection and, at times, a cry for help during my darkest nights of self-doubt. As I sit by the water, watching the turtles, ducks, and insects go about their lives, I'm reminded of my own search for purpose and meaning. I often find myself lost in thought, pondering the mysteries of life, but as I walk past the pond, the park, and the houses, I reach the main street, where the sun's radiance paints the sky with hues of yellow and blue. And there, I'm reminded of the mountains, always present, yet often overlooked. They stand tall, their grandeur a source of inspiration, urging me to persevere.",
            "If you're planning a trip to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you won't have a hard time finding it. The public transportation in New York City is great, making it super easy to get around. Bensonhurst is a pretty urban area, so you'll still get that quintessential New York City vibe during your visit. As you walk around, keep an eye out for the numerous Asian stores that dot the neighborhood. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurst has seen a significant influx of Asian residents, which is reflected in the abundance of Asian-owned stores on almost every block. You'll likely find Asian supermarkets and laundromats in abundance, and the locals love them for their great food quality, affordable prices, and convenience. Just a block away from me, there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk of each other, making grocery shopping a breeze. Of course, Bensonhurst isn't exclusively Asian - it's a melting pot of cultures, with immigrants and their American-born kids calling the neighborhood home. Many of the big businesses in the area are Asian-owned, but you'll also find a beautiful, recently renovated park nearby with plenty of facilities like basketball courts, a soccer/baseball field, handball courts, a playground, and even a water feature for kids to enjoy during the summer. As you'd expect in New York City, the park is a vibrant hub of activity, showcasing the area's diversity in the best possible light. One thing you won't find in abundance in Bensonhurst is corporate skyscrapers - co-op living buildings and condominium apartments are the norm, with many residents living in two-family homes. The people here are generally nice, but be warned: the noise levels can get pretty high, with cars blasting music and speeding down the streets. If you're planning a nighttime visit, be mindful of your surroundings - while the neighborhood is safe, you can never be too careful. I've had my share of run-ins with troublemakers in the past, including a physical altercation and a package theft incident. While it's a common problem, package theft is a concern in this area. One more thing to watch out for: dog owners who don't clean up after their pets. Every morning, you'll likely spot dog waste on the sidewalk or near the train station or supermarket. My pet peeve? Dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be sure to keep your shoes clean!",
            "Lately, I've been noticing that my neighborhood lacks sidewalks, and my house happens to be situated at the top of the steepest hill in the area. Locals have nicknamed it the \"workout hill\" since joggers often use it as part of their daily routine. Due to the absence of sidewalks on my street, everyone walks on the road, which can be hazardous, especially with potholes scattered here and there. The telephone and electric wires around the block appear tattered, and constant storms cause branches and debris to knock down the power lines, necessitating frequent repairs. It's a common sight to see patchwork repairs on these wires. The landscape is dominated by tall evergreen trees, but residents tend to cut them down to preserve the ocean view. Many houses are built with large glass-fronted second stories to take in the breathtaking view of the bay. Watching the sunset is a treat, with the water getting lit up from below, and the sky turning orange. However, most days are overcast, resulting in a damp atmosphere and a lot of haze. Moss grows profusely on everything, including roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked for a month, and when I returned, it was a green, moss-covered mess that took three hours to clean off. Our neighborhood is relatively quiet, with not many children around, except for a school a short distance away. Mostly retired people reside in our area, and instead of kids, you often see dogs roaming the streets or racing each other. They're quite common in our neighborhood, and if you leave a door or window open, you risk having them sneak into your house. I once found one in my living room and had to shoo it out the front door. Rabbits are also abundant in the area, and while they can be a nuisance to gardeners as they dig up plant roots and burrow into lawns, my cats enjoy hunting them. We also have our fair share of birds, including small sparrows, hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle that swoops by before being chased away by crows. If you're willing to hike downhill to the waterfront, you can find a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. The shoreline isn't extensive, but the rocks along the shore are fun to throw into the water. The bay is relatively narrow, and on most days, you can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist.",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area in a small town in Tennessee, surrounded by state highways that bring a moderate amount of traffic to our quiet street. Our neighborhood is generally stable, with not many new residents moving in, so I've gotten accustomed to knowing most of my neighbors. Daily life revolves around yard work and daily routines. In winter, we enjoy sledding down the hill on our side street, and since our house is located at the front of our street, we have a clear view of everyone passing by. We're always on the lookout for unfamiliar vehicles. Some neighbors take walks for exercise or to walk their dogs, while kids can be seen riding their bikes. We spend most of our time at home working from our house, with my wife and our two daughters – aged eleven and fourteen – keeping me company. As a result, everyone in the neighborhood is familiar with our coming and going. We're not ones to shy away from spending time outdoors, even on rainy days. Occasionally, we fire up the barbecue on our back deck, filling the air with a pleasant smell. The sound of lawn mowers is a regular occurrence from March to October, a reminder that our neighborhood was once a wooded area and still retains its lush tree cover. This brings a lot of shade, but also a lot of leaves in the fall, requiring us to rake and burn them annually. I must admit, I enjoy the smell of burning leaves, a sure sign that fall has arrived. Lately, the lack of winter has made the season feel like a prolonged fall. Our garage, located at the back of our house, sees minimal use, except when I'm working on my truck or other projects, which allows me to stay connected to the neighborhood. Holidays are generally quiet, with occasional visits from out-of-town family members during Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, and Christmas, resulting in an influx of cars on our street. Overall, I'm content with living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be an ideal neighborhood.",
            "My home is situated smack in the middle of a high desert landscape, where dirt and dust seem to rule supreme. Anyone who hasn't experienced living here wouldn't grasp the perpetual sight of brown hues and the sense of awe when spotting a lawn, which is usually a result of extensive maintenance. When I first moved here in the 90s, houses were scattered far and wide, giving it a more secluded feel. Although it's not much different now, with new developments sprouting up, our neighborhood is slowly transforming into a bustling urban area, just like many other places. The people here are generally friendly, but, like any city, it has its share of good and not-so-good aspects. I've been fortunate to be surrounded by kind-hearted elderly folks, making my neighborhood a more pleasant place to live. Our local stores are mostly chains, such as Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you're craving fresh produce, you'll have to venture out. The dominant industries in my city appear to be construction, as there's still plenty of open space left to be developed. This prospect unsettles me a bit, as I prefer things as they are. I left behind the hustle and bustle of a big city and don't want to go back. Speaking of construction, my job as a drywall and T-bar installer is located in this very field. What I appreciate about my home is the diverse wildlife. The high desert is a magnet for visitors, not just for its breathtaking beauty but also for the unique ecosystems it supports. It's essential for human residents to learn about the non-human inhabitants of this environment to coexist peacefully and responsibly. My family and I have grown accustomed to the local wildlife, and my kids are particularly fond of lizards and desert insects. As I write this, they're outside trying to catch various specimens. When it comes to attractions, we have a few notable ones. Victorville is an excellent destination for families looking to experience the desert. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with the San Bernardino County Fair, which offers an unforgettable experience with a mix of activities and fun. Visit nearby Wrightwood to witness the snow-capped mountains and take part in winter sports to cap off your visit. For those interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem, the Victor Valley Museum is a must-visit, featuring geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of Victorville's development and growth.",
            "When people ask me to describe my neighborhood, I give answers that are, in a way, quite distinct. You see, my neighbors aren't just the folks who live next door, but the people I share my college campus with. The dormitory I stay in is my community, and the surrounding campus is my neighborhood too, albeit to a lesser degree. Now, you might think my situation's a bit unusual, but my neighborhood still shares some common traits with what you'd expect from a typical neighborhood. It's got houses, people, stores, and parks – the basics, really. Let's start with the \"houses\" in my neighborhood, although they're a bit different from what you'd find elsewhere. In my neck of the woods, we've got three types of housing: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory houses. First off, the apartments usually have 2-4 people sharing a room, with 4-6 rooms per floor, and about 20 people living in each building on average. Then there are the actual houses, which are mostly 2-4 bedroom setups rented by alumni, but there aren't many of those around. Last but not least, we've got the dorm rooms, which are the most common type of housing here, with two people sharing a room, except in some cases. With housing covered, let's move on to the people. My school's all about being diverse, and that's reflected in my neighborhood's makeup. We've got people from all walks of life and cultures living here, with the professional staff in the houses, new students in the dorms, and older students in the apartments. Talking about the people here would take too long, so let's skip to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. As my school is basically a self-contained neighborhood, we've got plenty of stores and a single park. The stores offer a mix of regular dining options and the school's own brand of clothing and grocery stores, so you can find everything you need within our neighborhood boundaries. Our park is a playground for all the diverse folks in my neighborhood, kept clean and safe thanks to everyone's efforts.",
            "I've been living in this neighborhood for about 10 years now, so I guess I can share some of my experiences. When I first moved here from Riverdale to Stockbridge, I was really down in the dumps. I cried because I missed my old place and the people there, but my parents wanted the best for my little sister and me, so we had to move to a better area with a nicer house and a better school. Looking back, it was a tough transition, but I slowly got used to it and made some new friends and acquaintances in school. I didn't really get to know my neighbors that well, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis, who lived right next door. They've been like family to me over the years, and I'm grateful for their presence in my life. I still remember the time I went to Mr. Glen's wedding - it was a blast, and I'm looking forward to having a similar celebration when I get married someday and can give my future wife the life she deserves. At the wedding, I was lucky enough to catch the little strap that Ms. Veda threw off her leg, but unfortunately, I missed the flowers. I had a great time dancing with Marsharii, Mr. Glen's daughter, but I haven't seen her since. I hope she's doing well and achieving her goals. This neighborhood can be confusing, but with the help of GPS, I've been able to explore it more. I've hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis, and we used to spend hours playing video games and just enjoying life. Sometimes I'd go to the park and connect with nature, which helps calm me down and brings me a sense of peace. I also like to visit the park and practice my balance with sticks I bought from Home Depot, and I sometimes bring my bokken wooden sword along. I enjoy doing what I love. There are also a basketball and tennis court nearby, although I haven't played in a while, it's nice to know they're there in case I want to pick it up again. My dad used to take me and my best friend to play tennis with Mr. Graves, and we always had a great time, even though they pushed us hard. I've had a lot of fun in this neighborhood, and there are plenty of stories to share, but these are the ones that really stand out to me. I'm excited to see what the future holds.",
            "Living in my neighborhood is pretty ideal for me because it's just a short walk to the college I attend. Most of the apartments around me are decently priced, and there are some affordable bars and restaurants nearby that I enjoy going to. However, one of the bars just got a new name and seems to be priced a bit higher, but the quality of service and drinks is still good. The crowd is generally nice, consisting of college students and low-income residents. The area is also quite family-friendly, with an elementary school nearby that's within walking distance. I don't really know my neighbors, but I'm a bit amused by how they often smoke weed - the management even installed an air freshener unit in front of their door, which my boyfriend and I found quite funny. It's almost like they're being mocked. The buildings in my area are mostly old but have been renovated inside. Down the street, there are some brand new apartments, but I'm not a fan because I heard the construction wasn't great and the rent is still quite high. I think it's a scam, but since they're close to campus, the management gets away with it. There's a super cheap restaurant nearby that serves food on paper plates and microwaves most of their dishes. Across from it is a gas station that's not exactly a great place to work. Thanks to some city funding, the road was repaved last summer, making it look a bit nicer with a big sidewalk and lots of grass. However, my apartment building is surrounded by a lot of trees, which I think is nice. They've cut down a few, but there are still plenty more than in the surrounding areas. Behind my building is a tree line and another apartment complex. The street behind mine is 43rd, and it's not as nice as 42nd where I live. The sidewalks are in bad shape, and most of the buildings look run-down. The street is lined with trees, but it's probably just to hide the state of the buildings. There have been some issues with crime in the area, particularly at an apartment complex on 43rd, but I don't think it's entirely their fault. There are other apartments across from me with similar problems and a transient population. Despite this, I like living here because it's affordable and convenient, with the university nearby and two bus stops for easy access to the store and downtown.",
            "I live in a neighborhood with a unique charm. It's made up of identical-looking duplexes on a cul-de-sac, each painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. The friendly vibe is palpable, with most neighbors getting along and even chatting with each other on their driveways in the evenings. It's a refreshing escape from the digital world we're often immersed in, like stepping back in time. We're surrounded by lush fields, trees, and the vast blue sky with puffy white clouds, creating a serene atmosphere. However, this season brought some unexpected challenges – tornado warnings and actual sirens that forced us to seek shelter. I was right there in my bathtub, clutching my little dog and my purse, while my bigger dog stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The neighborhood was eerily quiet, except for the sound of hail pounding the ground. As the storm passed, the temperature dropped drastically, causing the road to steam up. The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement, and as I looked up, a beautiful double rainbow appeared in the sky. I quickly grabbed my camera and snapped some amazing shots to share with my friends and family on Facebook. They were just as amazed as I was. The streets remained quiet for a while until people returned home, and then it was back to normal – kids playing outside while their parents cooked dinner. I'm so grateful to have found this lovely neighborhood, especially after moving from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I adore the Southern accent and the friendly people. My two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment might look the same as the others on the outside, but each one has its unique interior. Some are surprisingly small, and I'm still trying to figure out why. I love taking long walks through the big field behind my home and strolling down to the pond, where I often spot deer and listen to the enchanting song of the bullfrog. It's a great place to live, just 40 minutes outside Charlotte. Every morning starts with the sweet sound of roosters crowing from the nearby farms, giving me a sense of living in a small village community. Even the nearby farm has a lovable donkey that brays in the evening to remind us he's there. I feel so lucky to have found this gem of a neighborhood.",
            "My family and I moved into this neighborhood a little while before I started eighth grade. It took some time for me to adjust and make friends, but I ended up becoming close to two neighbours, one of whom lives just two doors down from me and the other on the same street. Unfortunately, they're no longer living here now, but the memories we made are still vivid. The people who've been here since I first moved in are still around, which is nice. My neighbourhood is pretty typical, with rows of two-story houses, and every weekend when the weather's warm, you can hear kids playing outside. It's usually pretty quiet here most weekdays, though. I've never had any issues with my neighbours, and I feel comfortable trusting them. I've ordered plenty of packages online and never had one go missing from my porch. There's a park about a minute's walk from my house, where I have lots of fond memories. I used to play basketball, football, and baseball with the other guys in the neighbourhood, but one of my worst memories is also from there – I got elbowed in the nose while playing football! Despite that, the good times far outweigh the bad. Nowadays, when I visit the park, it's usually to spend time with my cousin's younger kids. They love playing on the swings and slides, and it brings a smile to my face seeing them have so much fun. The park holds a special place in my heart, and every time I go there, I'm filled with nostalgia. \n\nMy neighbourhood is pretty diverse, with loads of different food options nearby. Within a one-mile radius, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, with the rise of food delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash, many people just order in instead of going out. The most popular spots are usually the fast food chains, which are common in most suburban neighbourhoods. There are plenty of pizza places too. The local stores have everything you could need, including multiple dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store – a popular chain in the Midwest. Some of the stores even cater to specific tastes, like an Indian-owned shop where you can buy ingredients for homemade Indian dishes or ready-made food. Overall, I'm really happy with my neighbourhood. When I see the horror stories on social media and the news about people's experiences with their neighbours, I feel grateful for mine.",
            "My neighborhood is a humble little town in South Carolina. It may not stand out, but it has a significant impact on the region's agriculture. Johnston proudly claims to be the Peach Capital of the World, and this pride is reflected on the town's welcoming sign. The town is mainly composed of farmland with peach trees and cattle dominating the landscape. Houses are scattered, with most being two-story homes featuring either metal or gray roofs to combat the scorching summer heat. Those situated outside the main part of town are often farther back from the road, allowing for the front fields to be used for animals and crops. The main part of town is marked by a single four-way stop light, where you'll find the town's only stores. For those craving convenience food, there's Hong Kong, a family-run Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, but it sadly closed down not too long ago. You'll also find Maxwell and Halford Drug, a small family-owned pharmacy famous for their Cherry Coca-Cola. A small, but pricey grocery store called IGA is the town's only supermarket, but many residents prefer to visit the Walmart in nearby Batesburg-Leesville for their grocery needs. The most popular store in town, however, is Dollar General, which sells a wide range of everyday essentials and is always bustling from opening to closing time. There's also Possibilities Furniture & More, a cozy furniture store run by a well-known local woman who hires movers to deliver purchased items. Next door to the furniture store is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a small pet groomers offering various services like daycare, boarding, and grooming. Both the doctor's and veterinary practice are situated outside the main part of town, but they're both well-equipped to serve the community. Johnston Elementary School is the town's only school, and students attend middle and high school in the neighboring town after completing fifth grade. Although there aren't many parks or entertainment options, the town is currently developing a 2.5-acre recreational area to provide families with more opportunities for outdoor activities and attract new residents. Despite its simplicity, Johnston is a charming town that can easily go unnoticed in the blink of an eye.",
            "The first time I heard about my area, I was tuning into a podcast about people who had vanished. It caught me off guard, as almost every apartment in the neighborhood was being sold for over $1000 a month. I had never heard anything about it, nor had any of my friends. I guess that's what happens when you're struggling. I know a few of my friends have trouble sleeping at night because things are just so expensive. But we've learned to be frugal over the years. You start to get used to the smell of flea market toys and old clothes that have been tucked away for a while. You smell less in adulthood, and you might even start smoking or just get used to things being a certain way. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty old magazines stacked on an old piano, and it gets stuck in the leather even after you wash it. Our neighborhood has three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start from the far side, you can visit two charity shops, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curio shop. Downtown is crowded, with cars and people everywhere in the morning, but you wouldn't know it in the thrift stores. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the stores are always quiet. It's a great place to waste an afternoon. Every year, there are more and more cars and people flooding the city. It's developing, they say. One of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery calls it home, and it's still showing signs of growth. It reminds me of New York. Everyone's got their own goals, and nobody really bothers you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep your shell as long as you want, and the city will just roll with it. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have more of a community of friends than a bunch of strangers living in an apartment. We come together for birthdays, funerals, and when we need each other. In some ways, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors, and they treat me pretty well. I try to keep my apartment clean and leave them food, and they do the same for me. We exchange mail and it's nice to see them. I think they enjoy my presence just as much as I do theirs. Despite living in a massive, impersonal modernist sprawl, it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't completely mess up my life.",
            "My neighborhood is a classic example of cookie cutter suburbia. I live in an area where the presence of a homeowner's association is strongly felt. As soon as you step in, you'll notice rows of perfectly maintained single-family homes, thanks to the HOA. The front yards are surprisingly uniform, with a small patch of grass, decorative pebbles, and short driveways. Every now and then, you'll spot a small tree or two. It's also common to see two-car garages on most homes. The roads are immaculate, with newly paved concrete and no potholes in sight. While the majority of houses are single-story, a few have two stories. One thing that stands out is the unique mailbox system. Instead of having individual mailboxes in front of each house, we have a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street, which requires a key to access your specific box. There are also two larger lockers for packages, all thanks to the HOA's emphasis on uniformity. Our neighborhood is situated on the outskirts of the nearby city, making it a mix of rural and suburban living. As a result, we have plenty of space for various amenities. There are multiple community pools, all well-maintained and gated, where anyone living here can swim. We also have walking trails where you can take your dog for a walk or enjoy an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get some exercise; simply running around the neighborhood will suffice.\n\nThe community is predominantly made up of retirees, who make up a significant portion of the residents. It's an extremely safe area, with everyone looking out for one another. Mixed in with the retirees are a few middle-aged and young professionals. Our city is surprisingly large in terms of population but has a small-town feel. We have all the amenities you'd expect, including a single mall that may not be huge but gets the job done. It takes me around 15 minutes to drive to any major destination, but once I arrive, I'm greeted with a variety of stores to choose from. We have high-end grocery stores with organic options to bargain outlets with limited selection and minimal staff to keep costs low. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have many nice amenities like pools and walking trails, and while we're not right next door to shopping, it's just a short drive to get to any major chain store.",
            "I reside in a small Midwestern town just on the outskirts of a major city, nestled in the suburbs. My neighborhood, situated on the east side, is considered one of the economically disadvantaged areas of the town. The property values are relatively low, with many houses being rented or owned by families with lower incomes. Yet, it's not an uninviting place. My neighbors are generally friendly folks who greet me with a smile when I walk down the street. Although the crime rates are slightly higher than in other parts of town, they're still manageable. Over the past decade, there have been some violent incidents, including a few shootings and a homicide, within a few blocks of my home. I recall our next-door neighbors losing their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Thankfully, our family hasn't been directly affected by crime, except for the occasional missing item from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. Our town has been significantly impacted by the \"opioid epidemic\" that has affected many parts of the United States. However, there are various resources available to combat this issue, including rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those struggling with addiction. Despite these challenges, our town has many appealing qualities. My son's elementary school boasts an excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. He has not faced any bullying, thanks to the positive atmosphere of the school, and he genuinely enjoys attending. We have an active PTO that organizes numerous events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Given that over 20% of our town's population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. No child or family is treated as inferior due to financial constraints, and the costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are relatively low. The City Council and staff have made efforts to improve our town's appearance, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side, where I reside, tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for my neighbors and me. Overall, I appreciate living in this town. People are generally kind, the schools are excellent, there are sufficient shopping options to meet our needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it's comfortable and suitable. We've lived here for over 16 years, and it's hard to imagine calling anywhere else home.",
            "My neighborhood is a melting pot of culture, perched on a hill amidst a cluster of buildings steeped in history. I reside in a 7-story apartment building, directly opposite the old theater, and just a block away is this charming arcade bar that attracts a diverse crowd on warm summer evenings. On weekends in June and July, a long queue often forms outside its doors. Just a few blocks up is the city's nearest park, a sprawling green space considering its location in this part of town. The park is surrounded by concrete, with tall stairs carved into the wall. During the harsh winter months, homeless people set up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and the wide steps. This strategic placement keeps them relatively warmer, despite the lack of snow, and allows them easy access to the nearby family center, where they can bathe and shower. What I cherish about my city, though, isn't its historic architecture or the grand buildings that dot the hillsides. It's the community that truly makes it special. You see, Hilltop was once notorious for gang violence on the West Coast. Even decades later, stories of the federal government and DEA swooping in to clean up the streets still circulate. The people haven't forgotten. These stories are passed down through generations, from the original residents to newcomers like me, as a reminder of the neighborhood's rough past. Despite its reputation, the community works hard to maintain its cleanliness and care about what goes on in their city and on their block. They even caution outsiders not to venture out after dark, a warning that still carries the weight of its troubled history. As a 'not-quite-white' girl, I feel a connection to this community. Perhaps it's because I'm dark enough to blend in, or maybe Hilltop has accepted me as one of their own, someone who's aware of the ingrained racism and biases that plague our society. I know one thing: Hilltop will always be my home. I feel alive strolling through the streets at night, surrounded by people who've shown me kindness and empathy more often than not. It's a place where laundromats stay open late to let me charge my phone when I'm caught in the rain, and where strangers have handed me money and told me I'm beautiful and valuable, even when I felt invisible.",
            "I live in the heart of Rural America, nestled in the quaint town of Michigan. My home is surrounded by the picturesque beauty of farmland and charming tourist cities. Life here is simple, with no big city malls, chain stores like Wal-mart or Target, or restaurants like Applebee's within reach. You have to drive to get anywhere, but the journey is worth it, as I'm blessed to live in one of the most breathtaking places on earth, surrounded by two magnificent lakes - Lake Michigan to the one side and Lake Charlevoix to the other. Every corner of our small town offers a serene beach to dip your toes in, making it a haven for those seeking tranquility. My neighborhood is a classic example of small-town living, with houses that reflect the essence of Middle America. These aren't cookie-cutter homes, but rather unique, older residences that have been lovingly updated and remodeled over the years. Many of these homes boast basements, some of which are fully-fledged and open to the eye from the street. The neighborhood is a kaleidoscope of colors, with houses painted in every hue imaginable. Most homes have spacious yards, complete with trampolines, playsets, gardens, and fences for pets. Our community is comprised of hardworking individuals who strive to make a living and raise their families. On any given day, you'll see kids playing in the streets, people strolling their dogs, biking, or rollerblading. Neighbors know one another, and it's not uncommon to see a friendly wave or a smile from a passerby. The lawns are meticulously maintained, with green grass and well-trimmed plants adding to the neighborhood's charm. While it may not be the most stunning neighborhood you've ever seen, it's one that exudes a sense of belonging and a promise of a safe haven. Within walking distance, you'll find the county sheriff's department, the health department, and the recycling center, all of which serve our community. Our small town is also home to baseball and softball fields, where you can hear the excitement of the game, and a nearby airport where small planes take off and land. You can stroll to the local ice cream parlor, and if you're feeling adventurous, take a short walk downtown. The best part? My kids can ride their bikes to the nearby park, just 8 blocks away. It's a wonderful place to call home."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "Living in a big city like mine, I've got a pretty diverse neighborhood. House areas are scattered around commercial areas, which are filled with various shops, offices, restaurants, and entertainment spots. You can easily find new places to eat or shop at, with a mix of big brands and small boutiques popping up everywhere. Some boutiques line the streets, often just a short walk away from quiet neighborhoods that would be peaceful if not for all the things to see and do. We've also got a few parks nearby, and I've noticed that people often take their kids there. As for the people, my neighborhood has its fair share of diversity. There's even a small area with a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a group of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. If you venture a bit further out, you'll find even more people of different races and origins, often grouped together in their own mini-communities within the city. Places like Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia are just a few miles away, but getting there can take a while due to the crazy traffic. It's a big city, and most people prefer not to walk anywhere - only a few miles can turn into a two-hour drive during rush hour. To make matters worse, we've got some of the worst traffic in the world, and parking spots are hard to come by. On top of that, there's been a lot of construction lately, with new apartment buildings springing up everywhere. Some people are happy about the growth, but many are worried about the extra crowds and traffic. As for housing, we've got a mix of big apartment buildings, houses of all sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condos. Some properties have single-family homes, while others have duplexes. Even in my immediate neighborhood, you can find all sorts of housing options. The same goes for the people living here - we've got a wide range of ages, and I don't even know most of my neighbors. It's not as tight-knit a community as it used to be when I was a kid, but I do have some fond memories of playing with my next-door neighbor and a few other friends from back in the day.",
            "My neighborhood is a sight to behold. Most of the homes here are single-family dwellings, but there are a few that have been divided into two separate units, while still sharing a common wall. My house has a small front yard and a driveway to the left, just like most of the others. It's a nostalgic sight, reminiscent of a time not so long ago when the suburbs were the epitome of the American dream. Although that dream has lost its allure for some, my neighborhood remains a testament to its enduring appeal. The people here don't radiate the same optimism they once did, and the upkeep of the lawns has suffered, but there are still cars parked in every driveway, and the youth still play with abandon, as if nothing's changed. The local public school, which has been around for almost 90 years, still stands tall, giving the kids a glimpse of the future, while transporting the older residents back to a bygone era. The churches are few and far between, but the basketball courts are still bustling with activity. Despite the varying appearances of the homes, they all feel the same. There's a large supermarket called Super \"A\", owned by a Yemeni family, who are possibly the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The majority of residents, however, are African American. The streets are wide and spacious, and the kids usually play football, giving way to passing cars. Most people in my neighborhood have lived here for generations, and they can recall a time when everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school, but when the karate kid movies fell out of favor, the kids lost interest, so it's now a pharmacy, as everyone seems to think that medication can cure anything. There's also a small movie theater that shows old movies at a discounted price, which seems to please the older folks, who think it's a small price to pay for an evening out, minus the kids, of course. Our town is connected to the next one by a single expressway, but the entrance and exit are actually in the adjacent town. There was once a petition to get an exit in our town, but the youth supported it, while the older residents opposed it, fearing that the expressway would ruin our town. They managed to persuade the city council to reject the proposal. We're currently building a new high school, and we're still deciding on a mascot for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the perfect representation of our town.",
            "At first glance, this place may not seem like much - a residential area behind a shopping strip that's easy to overlook. It's not the kind of place that jumps out at you as having much to offer. But, if you take a walk behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and head back behind the hotels that are only occupied for part of the year, you'll stumble upon a thriving community. The streets here are lined with a row of apartment complexes, each one carefully situated next to the others like a series of connected puzzle pieces. These aren't the kind of places you'd expect to find in an area like this, but they're actually a world unto themselves that most people who live here don't even know about. Across the street from these complexes is a community college campus - a set of quiet, sleepy buildings that seem almost out of place alongside the bustling road. Students shuffle in, yawning and clutching their coffee, on their way to start their day at 7 am. The iron gates creak open to let them in, while commuters behind the wheel mutter and shake their fists in frustration when they get stuck behind them. Further down the road, another residential street intersects, lined with a park and a rehabilitation center for people with broken bones. The treatment center has a cheerful, welcoming atmosphere, with a lazy ceiling fan spinning gently above and a porch full of furniture. Children play in the park across the street, laughing and running through the grass while bees flit lazily around the flowers. Retirees walk their dogs on the walking path, shaking their heads at the teenagers on skateboards but smiling at the teenage girls gossiping by the playground equipment. A sushi place in a strip mall near the park has affordable food but never seems to be busy, while a swimming supply store and nail salon are right next door. You could fill your pool for the season, get a manicure, and enjoy some hibachi chicken all in one go - the kind of convenience that's hard to find. There's even a frozen yogurt shop where you can grab a treat while watching the teens do tricks on their skateboards and vape. This neighborhood is a slice of quintessential America, a piece of history in the sleepy south where time itself seems to stand still.",
            "As we cruised down the winding road lined with endless cornfields, my friend gazed out at the seemingly endless landscape. \"Where are we?\" she asked, taken aback by the vast open spaces. I smiled knowingly, anticipating her shock at the stark difference from the bustling town she was used to, where the grocery store was just a stone's throw away from her doorstep. Growing up in a small town in rural Ohio, I was familiar with this kind of scenery, and I shared my own experiences with her. In that moment, she finally grasped who I was and where I came from.\n\nAs we continued down the two-lane road, a tranquil quarry came into view, its calm waters reflecting the sky above. Just beyond it lay the quaint development where I lived, a collection of brick and stucco homes that each boasted a generous half-acre plot, lovingly tended by their owners. During spring, vibrant flowers bloomed alongside the region's iconic midwestern trees, their changing leaves a constant reminder of the passing seasons. The driveways were a sight to behold, lined with sleek Mercedes-Benz luxury cars that glistened in the sunlight after a refreshing wash. My friendly Korean neighbor, a constant presence in our community, could often be found tending to his lawn, his cheerful humming a stark contrast to the whirring of his John Deere mower.\n\nAs we approached my home, a grey stucco house nestled among the trees, the sounds of the outdoors grew louder – the occasional honk of a goose, the chirping of birds, and the soothing hum of the nearby stream. The Terrier, ever vigilant, chased after the geese in the side yard, while the bullfrogs and the occasional \"moo\" from the nearby farms added to the symphony of sounds. A handmade wooden bridge spanned the small stream, leading to a hidden oasis teeming with wildflowers, herbs, and naturally growing trees – a sanctuary where I spent countless hours as a child. From building tree forts to \"hunting\" animals (which mostly involved chasing them), there was never a dull moment, and I was always surrounded by friends from the neighborhood.\n\nIn the harsh winters, our small town transformed into a winter wonderland. The once-vibrant trees stood bare, their branches etched against the grey sky like skeletal fingers. But when snow fell, the backyard was transformed into a magical landscape of snow angels and snowmen, crafted by my mischievous little sister and me. We'd engage in fierce snowball fights, our arsenal of branches and sticks at the ready, and construct elaborate forts to house our winter wonderland. In those carefree days, nothing else mattered – just the joy of childhood, untainted by the complexities of adulthood.",
            "You gotta understand what being \"weird\" means in Portland, Oregon. The unofficial town motto, scribbled on a building that's a pizza joint, bar, music venue, and strip club all rolled into one, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, it's a nostalgic call to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a time when the city was less known, less expensive, and birthed unique subcultures. Others see it as a welcoming invitation - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but this time as a compliment. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the never-ending construction of new condos to house them, Portland remains weird. Being weird doesn't mean we're always accepting, but it does mean we're open to things that others might not be. We're not a place without modern conveniences or modern problems - we buy most of our stuff from China, just like everyone else. Being weird can mean a million different things, but in Portland, there's also plenty of normalcy. We have yoga, hipsters, and suits, just like any other city. Maybe weird just means we don't take ourselves too seriously. In my neighborhood, it's not uncommon to see colorful houses, home gardens overflowing with flowers, herbs, and veggies, and free boxes lining the streets in the summer. Free boxes contain all sorts of treasures - clothes, books, or anything else someone's getting rid of. Sometimes, they're magical, containing just the thing you need. That's what Portland is all about to me - the thrill of discovering something amazing on a random walk through a Southeast Portland neighborhood. Of course, I'm just one of the many weirdos who call this city home. Some of my neighbors would never be caught dead rummaging through a free box on the sidewalk. They'd rather go to goat yoga or catch a Timbers game (that's the city's soccer team). Portland's full of people who love all sorts of things, from unusual hobbies to wild ambitions. We're a city of dreamers, and dreamers who spend way too much time at the bar. Yes, we have problems with substance abuse, which often stem from deeper mental health issues. And yeah, the constant rain and grey skies don't exactly help. We also have a homelessness problem, which no one seems to know how to tackle. The homeless population is drawn by the social services we offer, but they're just not enough. Our non-homeless residents are torn between sympathy and frustration. In this, we're not so weird after all.",
            "The mountains have been steadfast companions, silently bearing witness to the sun's daily rituals of dawn and dusk. Unchanging and unwavering, they remain unaffected by life's turmoil and tribulations. On days when I'm overwhelmed and stressed, they beckon me to pause and take in their serene beauty, lending me the strength to carry on, one day at a time. I first fell under their spell when I began my university journey, and the mountains north of campus have held a special place in my heart ever since. While the university grounds have their own charms, from the striking buildings to the picturesque ponds and trees, it's the mountains that truly command my affection. The rest of the town is equally captivating, with its numerous cafes that have been the backdrop for countless hours of late-night studying fueled by caffeine. I cherish the memories of strolling or taking the bus to downtown, surrounded by the faded grandeur of old buildings, which blends seamlessly with the vibrant energy of the urban city. Yet, it's easy to retreat from the bustle and return to the tranquil atmosphere of the small town by simply walking past the library. This juxtaposition of contrasting atmospheres has created a unique sense of wonder, as if the town is constantly inviting me to explore its depths. Every memory I've created, whether it's sharing laughter with friends under the rusted swings in the park or rushing through downtown to catch a movie, is tied to a specific part of town. The ponds, however, hold a special significance - they've been a sanctuary for reflection and, at times, a cry for help during my darkest nights of self-doubt. As I sit by the water, watching the turtles, ducks, and insects go about their lives, I'm reminded of my own search for purpose and meaning. I often find myself lost in thought, pondering the mysteries of life, but as I walk past the pond, the park, and the houses, I reach the main street, where the sun's radiance paints the sky with hues of yellow and blue. And there, I'm reminded of the mountains, always present, yet often overlooked. They stand tall, their grandeur a source of inspiration, urging me to persevere.",
            "If you're planning a trip to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you won't have a hard time finding it. The public transportation in New York City is great, making it super easy to get around. Bensonhurst is a pretty urban area, so you'll still get that quintessential New York City vibe during your visit. As you walk around, keep an eye out for the numerous Asian stores that dot the neighborhood. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurst has seen a significant influx of Asian residents, which is reflected in the abundance of Asian-owned stores on almost every block. You'll likely find Asian supermarkets and laundromats in abundance, and the locals love them for their great food quality, affordable prices, and convenience. Just a block away from me, there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk of each other, making grocery shopping a breeze. Of course, Bensonhurst isn't exclusively Asian - it's a melting pot of cultures, with immigrants and their American-born kids calling the neighborhood home. Many of the big businesses in the area are Asian-owned, but you'll also find a beautiful, recently renovated park nearby with plenty of facilities like basketball courts, a soccer/baseball field, handball courts, a playground, and even a water feature for kids to enjoy during the summer. As you'd expect in New York City, the park is a vibrant hub of activity, showcasing the area's diversity in the best possible light. One thing you won't find in abundance in Bensonhurst is corporate skyscrapers - co-op living buildings and condominium apartments are the norm, with many residents living in two-family homes. The people here are generally nice, but be warned: the noise levels can get pretty high, with cars blasting music and speeding down the streets. If you're planning a nighttime visit, be mindful of your surroundings - while the neighborhood is safe, you can never be too careful. I've had my share of run-ins with troublemakers in the past, including a physical altercation and a package theft incident. While it's a common problem, package theft is a concern in this area. One more thing to watch out for: dog owners who don't clean up after their pets. Every morning, you'll likely spot dog waste on the sidewalk or near the train station or supermarket. My pet peeve? Dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be sure to keep your shoes clean!",
            "Lately, I've been noticing that my neighborhood lacks sidewalks, and my house happens to be situated at the top of the steepest hill in the area. Locals have nicknamed it the \"workout hill\" since joggers often use it as part of their daily routine. Due to the absence of sidewalks on my street, everyone walks on the road, which can be hazardous, especially with potholes scattered here and there. The telephone and electric wires around the block appear tattered, and constant storms cause branches and debris to knock down the power lines, necessitating frequent repairs. It's a common sight to see patchwork repairs on these wires. The landscape is dominated by tall evergreen trees, but residents tend to cut them down to preserve the ocean view. Many houses are built with large glass-fronted second stories to take in the breathtaking view of the bay. Watching the sunset is a treat, with the water getting lit up from below, and the sky turning orange. However, most days are overcast, resulting in a damp atmosphere and a lot of haze. Moss grows profusely on everything, including roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked for a month, and when I returned, it was a green, moss-covered mess that took three hours to clean off. Our neighborhood is relatively quiet, with not many children around, except for a school a short distance away. Mostly retired people reside in our area, and instead of kids, you often see dogs roaming the streets or racing each other. They're quite common in our neighborhood, and if you leave a door or window open, you risk having them sneak into your house. I once found one in my living room and had to shoo it out the front door. Rabbits are also abundant in the area, and while they can be a nuisance to gardeners as they dig up plant roots and burrow into lawns, my cats enjoy hunting them. We also have our fair share of birds, including small sparrows, hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle that swoops by before being chased away by crows. If you're willing to hike downhill to the waterfront, you can find a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. The shoreline isn't extensive, but the rocks along the shore are fun to throw into the water. The bay is relatively narrow, and on most days, you can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist.",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area in a small town in Tennessee, surrounded by state highways that bring a moderate amount of traffic to our quiet street. Our neighborhood is generally stable, with not many new residents moving in, so I've gotten accustomed to knowing most of my neighbors. Daily life revolves around yard work and daily routines. In winter, we enjoy sledding down the hill on our side street, and since our house is located at the front of our street, we have a clear view of everyone passing by. We're always on the lookout for unfamiliar vehicles. Some neighbors take walks for exercise or to walk their dogs, while kids can be seen riding their bikes. We spend most of our time at home working from our house, with my wife and our two daughters – aged eleven and fourteen – keeping me company. As a result, everyone in the neighborhood is familiar with our coming and going. We're not ones to shy away from spending time outdoors, even on rainy days. Occasionally, we fire up the barbecue on our back deck, filling the air with a pleasant smell. The sound of lawn mowers is a regular occurrence from March to October, a reminder that our neighborhood was once a wooded area and still retains its lush tree cover. This brings a lot of shade, but also a lot of leaves in the fall, requiring us to rake and burn them annually. I must admit, I enjoy the smell of burning leaves, a sure sign that fall has arrived. Lately, the lack of winter has made the season feel like a prolonged fall. Our garage, located at the back of our house, sees minimal use, except when I'm working on my truck or other projects, which allows me to stay connected to the neighborhood. Holidays are generally quiet, with occasional visits from out-of-town family members during Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, and Christmas, resulting in an influx of cars on our street. Overall, I'm content with living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be an ideal neighborhood.",
            "My home is situated smack in the middle of a high desert landscape, where dirt and dust seem to rule supreme. Anyone who hasn't experienced living here wouldn't grasp the perpetual sight of brown hues and the sense of awe when spotting a lawn, which is usually a result of extensive maintenance. When I first moved here in the 90s, houses were scattered far and wide, giving it a more secluded feel. Although it's not much different now, with new developments sprouting up, our neighborhood is slowly transforming into a bustling urban area, just like many other places. The people here are generally friendly, but, like any city, it has its share of good and not-so-good aspects. I've been fortunate to be surrounded by kind-hearted elderly folks, making my neighborhood a more pleasant place to live. Our local stores are mostly chains, such as Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you're craving fresh produce, you'll have to venture out. The dominant industries in my city appear to be construction, as there's still plenty of open space left to be developed. This prospect unsettles me a bit, as I prefer things as they are. I left behind the hustle and bustle of a big city and don't want to go back. Speaking of construction, my job as a drywall and T-bar installer is located in this very field. What I appreciate about my home is the diverse wildlife. The high desert is a magnet for visitors, not just for its breathtaking beauty but also for the unique ecosystems it supports. It's essential for human residents to learn about the non-human inhabitants of this environment to coexist peacefully and responsibly. My family and I have grown accustomed to the local wildlife, and my kids are particularly fond of lizards and desert insects. As I write this, they're outside trying to catch various specimens. When it comes to attractions, we have a few notable ones. Victorville is an excellent destination for families looking to experience the desert. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with the San Bernardino County Fair, which offers an unforgettable experience with a mix of activities and fun. Visit nearby Wrightwood to witness the snow-capped mountains and take part in winter sports to cap off your visit. For those interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem, the Victor Valley Museum is a must-visit, featuring geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of Victorville's development and growth.",
            "When people ask me to describe my neighborhood, I give answers that are, in a way, quite distinct. You see, my neighbors aren't just the folks who live next door, but the people I share my college campus with. The dormitory I stay in is my community, and the surrounding campus is my neighborhood too, albeit to a lesser degree. Now, you might think my situation's a bit unusual, but my neighborhood still shares some common traits with what you'd expect from a typical neighborhood. It's got houses, people, stores, and parks – the basics, really. Let's start with the \"houses\" in my neighborhood, although they're a bit different from what you'd find elsewhere. In my neck of the woods, we've got three types of housing: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory houses. First off, the apartments usually have 2-4 people sharing a room, with 4-6 rooms per floor, and about 20 people living in each building on average. Then there are the actual houses, which are mostly 2-4 bedroom setups rented by alumni, but there aren't many of those around. Last but not least, we've got the dorm rooms, which are the most common type of housing here, with two people sharing a room, except in some cases. With housing covered, let's move on to the people. My school's all about being diverse, and that's reflected in my neighborhood's makeup. We've got people from all walks of life and cultures living here, with the professional staff in the houses, new students in the dorms, and older students in the apartments. Talking about the people here would take too long, so let's skip to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. As my school is basically a self-contained neighborhood, we've got plenty of stores and a single park. The stores offer a mix of regular dining options and the school's own brand of clothing and grocery stores, so you can find everything you need within our neighborhood boundaries. Our park is a playground for all the diverse folks in my neighborhood, kept clean and safe thanks to everyone's efforts.",
            "I've been living in this neighborhood for about 10 years now, so I guess I can share some of my experiences. When I first moved here from Riverdale to Stockbridge, I was really down in the dumps. I cried because I missed my old place and the people there, but my parents wanted the best for my little sister and me, so we had to move to a better area with a nicer house and a better school. Looking back, it was a tough transition, but I slowly got used to it and made some new friends and acquaintances in school. I didn't really get to know my neighbors that well, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis, who lived right next door. They've been like family to me over the years, and I'm grateful for their presence in my life. I still remember the time I went to Mr. Glen's wedding - it was a blast, and I'm looking forward to having a similar celebration when I get married someday and can give my future wife the life she deserves. At the wedding, I was lucky enough to catch the little strap that Ms. Veda threw off her leg, but unfortunately, I missed the flowers. I had a great time dancing with Marsharii, Mr. Glen's daughter, but I haven't seen her since. I hope she's doing well and achieving her goals. This neighborhood can be confusing, but with the help of GPS, I've been able to explore it more. I've hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis, and we used to spend hours playing video games and just enjoying life. Sometimes I'd go to the park and connect with nature, which helps calm me down and brings me a sense of peace. I also like to visit the park and practice my balance with sticks I bought from Home Depot, and I sometimes bring my bokken wooden sword along. I enjoy doing what I love. There are also a basketball and tennis court nearby, although I haven't played in a while, it's nice to know they're there in case I want to pick it up again. My dad used to take me and my best friend to play tennis with Mr. Graves, and we always had a great time, even though they pushed us hard. I've had a lot of fun in this neighborhood, and there are plenty of stories to share, but these are the ones that really stand out to me. I'm excited to see what the future holds.",
            "Living in my neighborhood is pretty ideal for me because it's just a short walk to the college I attend. Most of the apartments around me are decently priced, and there are some affordable bars and restaurants nearby that I enjoy going to. However, one of the bars just got a new name and seems to be priced a bit higher, but the quality of service and drinks is still good. The crowd is generally nice, consisting of college students and low-income residents. The area is also quite family-friendly, with an elementary school nearby that's within walking distance. I don't really know my neighbors, but I'm a bit amused by how they often smoke weed - the management even installed an air freshener unit in front of their door, which my boyfriend and I found quite funny. It's almost like they're being mocked. The buildings in my area are mostly old but have been renovated inside. Down the street, there are some brand new apartments, but I'm not a fan because I heard the construction wasn't great and the rent is still quite high. I think it's a scam, but since they're close to campus, the management gets away with it. There's a super cheap restaurant nearby that serves food on paper plates and microwaves most of their dishes. Across from it is a gas station that's not exactly a great place to work. Thanks to some city funding, the road was repaved last summer, making it look a bit nicer with a big sidewalk and lots of grass. However, my apartment building is surrounded by a lot of trees, which I think is nice. They've cut down a few, but there are still plenty more than in the surrounding areas. Behind my building is a tree line and another apartment complex. The street behind mine is 43rd, and it's not as nice as 42nd where I live. The sidewalks are in bad shape, and most of the buildings look run-down. The street is lined with trees, but it's probably just to hide the state of the buildings. There have been some issues with crime in the area, particularly at an apartment complex on 43rd, but I don't think it's entirely their fault. There are other apartments across from me with similar problems and a transient population. Despite this, I like living here because it's affordable and convenient, with the university nearby and two bus stops for easy access to the store and downtown.",
            "I live in a neighborhood with a unique charm. It's made up of identical-looking duplexes on a cul-de-sac, each painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. The friendly vibe is palpable, with most neighbors getting along and even chatting with each other on their driveways in the evenings. It's a refreshing escape from the digital world we're often immersed in, like stepping back in time. We're surrounded by lush fields, trees, and the vast blue sky with puffy white clouds, creating a serene atmosphere. However, this season brought some unexpected challenges – tornado warnings and actual sirens that forced us to seek shelter. I was right there in my bathtub, clutching my little dog and my purse, while my bigger dog stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The neighborhood was eerily quiet, except for the sound of hail pounding the ground. As the storm passed, the temperature dropped drastically, causing the road to steam up. The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement, and as I looked up, a beautiful double rainbow appeared in the sky. I quickly grabbed my camera and snapped some amazing shots to share with my friends and family on Facebook. They were just as amazed as I was. The streets remained quiet for a while until people returned home, and then it was back to normal – kids playing outside while their parents cooked dinner. I'm so grateful to have found this lovely neighborhood, especially after moving from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I adore the Southern accent and the friendly people. My two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment might look the same as the others on the outside, but each one has its unique interior. Some are surprisingly small, and I'm still trying to figure out why. I love taking long walks through the big field behind my home and strolling down to the pond, where I often spot deer and listen to the enchanting song of the bullfrog. It's a great place to live, just 40 minutes outside Charlotte. Every morning starts with the sweet sound of roosters crowing from the nearby farms, giving me a sense of living in a small village community. Even the nearby farm has a lovable donkey that brays in the evening to remind us he's there. I feel so lucky to have found this gem of a neighborhood.",
            "My family and I moved into this neighborhood a little while before I started eighth grade. It took some time for me to adjust and make friends, but I ended up becoming close to two neighbours, one of whom lives just two doors down from me and the other on the same street. Unfortunately, they're no longer living here now, but the memories we made are still vivid. The people who've been here since I first moved in are still around, which is nice. My neighbourhood is pretty typical, with rows of two-story houses, and every weekend when the weather's warm, you can hear kids playing outside. It's usually pretty quiet here most weekdays, though. I've never had any issues with my neighbours, and I feel comfortable trusting them. I've ordered plenty of packages online and never had one go missing from my porch. There's a park about a minute's walk from my house, where I have lots of fond memories. I used to play basketball, football, and baseball with the other guys in the neighbourhood, but one of my worst memories is also from there – I got elbowed in the nose while playing football! Despite that, the good times far outweigh the bad. Nowadays, when I visit the park, it's usually to spend time with my cousin's younger kids. They love playing on the swings and slides, and it brings a smile to my face seeing them have so much fun. The park holds a special place in my heart, and every time I go there, I'm filled with nostalgia. \n\nMy neighbourhood is pretty diverse, with loads of different food options nearby. Within a one-mile radius, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, with the rise of food delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash, many people just order in instead of going out. The most popular spots are usually the fast food chains, which are common in most suburban neighbourhoods. There are plenty of pizza places too. The local stores have everything you could need, including multiple dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store – a popular chain in the Midwest. Some of the stores even cater to specific tastes, like an Indian-owned shop where you can buy ingredients for homemade Indian dishes or ready-made food. Overall, I'm really happy with my neighbourhood. When I see the horror stories on social media and the news about people's experiences with their neighbours, I feel grateful for mine.",
            "My neighborhood is a humble little town in South Carolina. It may not stand out, but it has a significant impact on the region's agriculture. Johnston proudly claims to be the Peach Capital of the World, and this pride is reflected on the town's welcoming sign. The town is mainly composed of farmland with peach trees and cattle dominating the landscape. Houses are scattered, with most being two-story homes featuring either metal or gray roofs to combat the scorching summer heat. Those situated outside the main part of town are often farther back from the road, allowing for the front fields to be used for animals and crops. The main part of town is marked by a single four-way stop light, where you'll find the town's only stores. For those craving convenience food, there's Hong Kong, a family-run Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, but it sadly closed down not too long ago. You'll also find Maxwell and Halford Drug, a small family-owned pharmacy famous for their Cherry Coca-Cola. A small, but pricey grocery store called IGA is the town's only supermarket, but many residents prefer to visit the Walmart in nearby Batesburg-Leesville for their grocery needs. The most popular store in town, however, is Dollar General, which sells a wide range of everyday essentials and is always bustling from opening to closing time. There's also Possibilities Furniture & More, a cozy furniture store run by a well-known local woman who hires movers to deliver purchased items. Next door to the furniture store is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a small pet groomers offering various services like daycare, boarding, and grooming. Both the doctor's and veterinary practice are situated outside the main part of town, but they're both well-equipped to serve the community. Johnston Elementary School is the town's only school, and students attend middle and high school in the neighboring town after completing fifth grade. Although there aren't many parks or entertainment options, the town is currently developing a 2.5-acre recreational area to provide families with more opportunities for outdoor activities and attract new residents. Despite its simplicity, Johnston is a charming town that can easily go unnoticed in the blink of an eye.",
            "The first time I heard about my area, I was tuning into a podcast about people who had vanished. It caught me off guard, as almost every apartment in the neighborhood was being sold for over $1000 a month. I had never heard anything about it, nor had any of my friends. I guess that's what happens when you're struggling. I know a few of my friends have trouble sleeping at night because things are just so expensive. But we've learned to be frugal over the years. You start to get used to the smell of flea market toys and old clothes that have been tucked away for a while. You smell less in adulthood, and you might even start smoking or just get used to things being a certain way. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty old magazines stacked on an old piano, and it gets stuck in the leather even after you wash it. Our neighborhood has three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start from the far side, you can visit two charity shops, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curio shop. Downtown is crowded, with cars and people everywhere in the morning, but you wouldn't know it in the thrift stores. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the stores are always quiet. It's a great place to waste an afternoon. Every year, there are more and more cars and people flooding the city. It's developing, they say. One of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery calls it home, and it's still showing signs of growth. It reminds me of New York. Everyone's got their own goals, and nobody really bothers you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep your shell as long as you want, and the city will just roll with it. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have more of a community of friends than a bunch of strangers living in an apartment. We come together for birthdays, funerals, and when we need each other. In some ways, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors, and they treat me pretty well. I try to keep my apartment clean and leave them food, and they do the same for me. We exchange mail and it's nice to see them. I think they enjoy my presence just as much as I do theirs. Despite living in a massive, impersonal modernist sprawl, it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't completely mess up my life.",
            "My neighborhood is a classic example of cookie cutter suburbia. I live in an area where the presence of a homeowner's association is strongly felt. As soon as you step in, you'll notice rows of perfectly maintained single-family homes, thanks to the HOA. The front yards are surprisingly uniform, with a small patch of grass, decorative pebbles, and short driveways. Every now and then, you'll spot a small tree or two. It's also common to see two-car garages on most homes. The roads are immaculate, with newly paved concrete and no potholes in sight. While the majority of houses are single-story, a few have two stories. One thing that stands out is the unique mailbox system. Instead of having individual mailboxes in front of each house, we have a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street, which requires a key to access your specific box. There are also two larger lockers for packages, all thanks to the HOA's emphasis on uniformity. Our neighborhood is situated on the outskirts of the nearby city, making it a mix of rural and suburban living. As a result, we have plenty of space for various amenities. There are multiple community pools, all well-maintained and gated, where anyone living here can swim. We also have walking trails where you can take your dog for a walk or enjoy an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get some exercise; simply running around the neighborhood will suffice.\n\nThe community is predominantly made up of retirees, who make up a significant portion of the residents. It's an extremely safe area, with everyone looking out for one another. Mixed in with the retirees are a few middle-aged and young professionals. Our city is surprisingly large in terms of population but has a small-town feel. We have all the amenities you'd expect, including a single mall that may not be huge but gets the job done. It takes me around 15 minutes to drive to any major destination, but once I arrive, I'm greeted with a variety of stores to choose from. We have high-end grocery stores with organic options to bargain outlets with limited selection and minimal staff to keep costs low. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have many nice amenities like pools and walking trails, and while we're not right next door to shopping, it's just a short drive to get to any major chain store.",
            "I reside in a small Midwestern town just on the outskirts of a major city, nestled in the suburbs. My neighborhood, situated on the east side, is considered one of the economically disadvantaged areas of the town. The property values are relatively low, with many houses being rented or owned by families with lower incomes. Yet, it's not an uninviting place. My neighbors are generally friendly folks who greet me with a smile when I walk down the street. Although the crime rates are slightly higher than in other parts of town, they're still manageable. Over the past decade, there have been some violent incidents, including a few shootings and a homicide, within a few blocks of my home. I recall our next-door neighbors losing their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Thankfully, our family hasn't been directly affected by crime, except for the occasional missing item from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. Our town has been significantly impacted by the \"opioid epidemic\" that has affected many parts of the United States. However, there are various resources available to combat this issue, including rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those struggling with addiction. Despite these challenges, our town has many appealing qualities. My son's elementary school boasts an excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. He has not faced any bullying, thanks to the positive atmosphere of the school, and he genuinely enjoys attending. We have an active PTO that organizes numerous events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Given that over 20% of our town's population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. No child or family is treated as inferior due to financial constraints, and the costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are relatively low. The City Council and staff have made efforts to improve our town's appearance, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side, where I reside, tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for my neighbors and me. Overall, I appreciate living in this town. People are generally kind, the schools are excellent, there are sufficient shopping options to meet our needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it's comfortable and suitable. We've lived here for over 16 years, and it's hard to imagine calling anywhere else home.",
            "My neighborhood is a melting pot of culture, perched on a hill amidst a cluster of buildings steeped in history. I reside in a 7-story apartment building, directly opposite the old theater, and just a block away is this charming arcade bar that attracts a diverse crowd on warm summer evenings. On weekends in June and July, a long queue often forms outside its doors. Just a few blocks up is the city's nearest park, a sprawling green space considering its location in this part of town. The park is surrounded by concrete, with tall stairs carved into the wall. During the harsh winter months, homeless people set up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and the wide steps. This strategic placement keeps them relatively warmer, despite the lack of snow, and allows them easy access to the nearby family center, where they can bathe and shower. What I cherish about my city, though, isn't its historic architecture or the grand buildings that dot the hillsides. It's the community that truly makes it special. You see, Hilltop was once notorious for gang violence on the West Coast. Even decades later, stories of the federal government and DEA swooping in to clean up the streets still circulate. The people haven't forgotten. These stories are passed down through generations, from the original residents to newcomers like me, as a reminder of the neighborhood's rough past. Despite its reputation, the community works hard to maintain its cleanliness and care about what goes on in their city and on their block. They even caution outsiders not to venture out after dark, a warning that still carries the weight of its troubled history. As a 'not-quite-white' girl, I feel a connection to this community. Perhaps it's because I'm dark enough to blend in, or maybe Hilltop has accepted me as one of their own, someone who's aware of the ingrained racism and biases that plague our society. I know one thing: Hilltop will always be my home. I feel alive strolling through the streets at night, surrounded by people who've shown me kindness and empathy more often than not. It's a place where laundromats stay open late to let me charge my phone when I'm caught in the rain, and where strangers have handed me money and told me I'm beautiful and valuable, even when I felt invisible.",
            "I live in the heart of Rural America, nestled in the quaint town of Michigan. My home is surrounded by the picturesque beauty of farmland and charming tourist cities. Life here is simple, with no big city malls, chain stores like Wal-mart or Target, or restaurants like Applebee's within reach. You have to drive to get anywhere, but the journey is worth it, as I'm blessed to live in one of the most breathtaking places on earth, surrounded by two magnificent lakes - Lake Michigan to the one side and Lake Charlevoix to the other. Every corner of our small town offers a serene beach to dip your toes in, making it a haven for those seeking tranquility. My neighborhood is a classic example of small-town living, with houses that reflect the essence of Middle America. These aren't cookie-cutter homes, but rather unique, older residences that have been lovingly updated and remodeled over the years. Many of these homes boast basements, some of which are fully-fledged and open to the eye from the street. The neighborhood is a kaleidoscope of colors, with houses painted in every hue imaginable. Most homes have spacious yards, complete with trampolines, playsets, gardens, and fences for pets. Our community is comprised of hardworking individuals who strive to make a living and raise their families. On any given day, you'll see kids playing in the streets, people strolling their dogs, biking, or rollerblading. Neighbors know one another, and it's not uncommon to see a friendly wave or a smile from a passerby. The lawns are meticulously maintained, with green grass and well-trimmed plants adding to the neighborhood's charm. While it may not be the most stunning neighborhood you've ever seen, it's one that exudes a sense of belonging and a promise of a safe haven. Within walking distance, you'll find the county sheriff's department, the health department, and the recycling center, all of which serve our community. Our small town is also home to baseball and softball fields, where you can hear the excitement of the game, and a nearby airport where small planes take off and land. You can stroll to the local ice cream parlor, and if you're feeling adventurous, take a short walk downtown. The best part? My kids can ride their bikes to the nearby park, just 8 blocks away. It's a wonderful place to call home."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

It's a nostalgic sight, reminiscent of a time not so long ago when the suburbs were the epitome of the American dream. Although that dream has lost its allure for some, my neighborhood remains a testament to its enduring appeal. The people here don't radiate the same optimism they once did, and the upkeep of the lawns has suffered, but there are still cars parked in every driveway, and the youth still play with abandon, as if nothing's changed.

            "At first glance, this place may not seem like much - a residential area behind a shopping strip that's easy to overlook. It's not the kind of place that jumps out at you as having much to offer. But, if you take a walk behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and head back behind the hotels that are only occupied for part of the year, you'll stumble upon a thriving community. The streets here are lined with a row of apartment complexes, each one carefully situated next to the others like a series of connected puzzle pieces.

            "As we cruised down the winding road lined with endless cornfields, my friend gazed out at the seemingly endless landscape. \"Where are we?\" she asked, taken aback by the vast open spaces. I smiled knowingly, anticipating her shock at the stark difference from the bustling town she was used to, where the grocery store was just a stone's throw away from her doorstep. Growing up in a small town in rural Ohio, I was familiar with this kind of scenery, and I shared my own experiences with her. In that moment, she finally grasped who I was and where I came from.\n\nAs we continued down the two-lane road, a tranquil quarry came into view, its calm waters reflecting the sky above. Just beyond it lay the quaint development where I lived, a collection of brick and stucco homes that each boasted a generous half-acre plot, lovingly tended by their owners. During spring, vibrant flowers bloomed alongside the region's iconic midwestern trees, their changing leaves a constant reminder of the passing seasons. The driveways were a sight to behold, lined with sleek Mercedes-Benz luxury cars that glistened in the sunlight after a refreshing wash. My friendly Korean neighbor, a constant presence in our community, could often be found tending to his lawn, his cheerful humming a stark contrast to the whirring of his John Deere mower.\n\nAs we approached my home, a grey stucco house nestled among the trees, the sounds of the outdoors grew louder – the occasional honk of a goose, the chirping of birds, and the soothing hum of the nearby stream. The Terrier, ever vigilant, chased after the geese in the side yard, while the bullfrogs and the occasional \"moo\" from the nearby farms added to the symphony of sounds. A handmade wooden bridge spanned the small stream, leading to a hidden oasis teeming with wildflowers, herbs, and naturally growing trees – a sanctuary where I spent countless hours as a child. From building tree forts to \"hunting\" animals (which mostly involved chasing them), there was never a dull moment, and I was always surrounded by friends from the neighborhood.\n\nIn the harsh winters, our small town transformed into a winter wonderland. The once-vibrant trees stood bare, their branches etched against the grey sky like skeletal fingers. But when snow fell, the backyard was transformed into a magical landscape of snow angels and snowmen, crafted by my mischievous little sister and me. We'd engage in fierce snowball fights, our arsenal of branches and sticks at the ready, and construct elaborate forts to house our winter wonderland. In those carefree days, nothing else mattered – just the joy of childhood, untainted by the complexities of adulthood.",
            "You gotta understand what being \"weird\" means in Portland, Oregon. The unofficial town motto, scribbled on a building that's a pizza joint, bar, music venue, and strip club all rolled into one, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, it's a nostalgic call to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a time when the city was less known, less expensive, and birthed unique subcultures. Others see it as a welcoming invitation - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but this time as a compliment. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the never-ending construction of new condos to house them, Portland remains weird. Being weird doesn't mean we're always accepting, but it does mean we're open to things that others might not be. We're not a place without modern conveniences or modern problems - we buy most of our stuff from China, just like everyone else. Being weird can mean a million different things, but in Portland, there's also plenty of normalcy. We have yoga, hipsters, and suits, just like any other city. Maybe weird just means we don't take ourselves too seriously. In my neighborhood, it's not uncommon to see colorful houses, home gardens overflowing with flowers, herbs, and veggies, and free boxes lining the streets in the summer. Free boxes contain all sorts of treasures - clothes, books, or anything else someone's getting rid of. Sometimes, they're magical, containing just the thing you need. That's what Portland is all about to me - the thrill of discovering something amazing on a random walk through a Southeast Portland neighborhood. Of course, I'm just one of the many weirdos who call this city home. Some of my neighbors would never be caught dead rummaging through a free box on the sidewalk. They'd rather go to goat yoga or catch a Timbers game (that's the city's soccer team). Portland's full of people who love all sorts of things, from unusual hobbies to wild ambitions. We're a city of dreamers, and dreamers who spend way too much time at the bar. Yes, we have problems with substance abuse, which often stem from deeper mental health issues. And yeah, the constant rain and grey skies don't exactly help. We also have a homelessness problem, which no one seems to know how to tackle. The homeless population is drawn by the social services we offer, but they're just not enough. Our non-homeless residents are torn between sympathy and frustration.

On days when I'm overwhelmed and stressed, they beckon me to pause and take in their serene beauty, lending me the strength to carry on, one day at a time. I first fell under their spell when I began my university journey, and the mountains north of campus have held a special place in my heart ever since. While the university grounds have their own charms, from the striking buildings to the picturesque ponds and trees, it's the mountains that truly command my affection. The rest of the town is equally captivating, with its numerous cafes that have been the backdrop for countless hours of late-night studying fueled by caffeine. I cherish the memories of strolling or taking the bus to downtown, surrounded by the faded grandeur of old buildings, which blends seamlessly with the vibrant energy of the urban city. Yet, it's easy to retreat from the bustle and return to the tranquil atmosphere of the small town by simply walking past the library. This juxtaposition of contrasting atmospheres has created a unique sense of wonder, as if the town is constantly inviting me to explore its depths. Every memory I've created, whether it's sharing laughter with friends under the rusted swings in the park or rushing through downtown to catch a movie, is tied to a specific part of town. The ponds, however, hold a special significance - they've been a sanctuary for reflection and, at times, a cry for help during my darkest nights of self-doubt. As I sit by the water, watching the turtles, ducks, and insects go about their lives, I'm reminded of my own search for purpose and meaning. I often find myself lost in thought, pondering the mysteries of life, but as I walk past the pond, the park, and the houses, I reach the main street, where the sun's radiance paints the sky with hues of yellow and blue. And there, I'm reminded of the mountains, always present, yet often overlooked. They stand tall, their grandeur a source of inspiration, urging me to persevere.",
            "If you're planning a trip to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you won't have a hard time finding it. The public transportation in New York City is great, making it super easy to get around. Bensonhurst is a pretty urban area, so you'll still get that quintessential New York City vibe during your visit. As you walk around, keep an eye out for the numerous Asian stores that dot the neighborhood. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurst has seen a significant influx of Asian residents, which is reflected in the abundance of Asian-owned stores on almost every block. You'll likely find Asian supermarkets and laundromats in abundance, and the locals love them for their great food quality, affordable prices, and convenience. Just a block away from me, there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk of each other, making grocery shopping a breeze. Of course, Bensonhurst isn't exclusively Asian - it's a melting pot of cultures, with immigrants and their American-born kids calling the neighborhood home. Many of the big businesses in the area are Asian-owned, but you'll also find a beautiful, recently renovated park nearby with plenty of facilities like basketball courts, a soccer/baseball field, handball courts, a playground, and even a water feature for kids to enjoy during the summer. As you'd expect in New York City, the park is a vibrant hub of activity, showcasing the area's diversity in the best possible light. One thing you won't find in abundance in Bensonhurst is corporate skyscrapers - co-op living buildings and condominium apartments are the norm, with many residents living in two-family homes. The people here are generally nice, but be warned: the noise levels can get pretty high, with cars blasting music and speeding down the streets. If you're planning a nighttime visit, be mindful of your surroundings - while the neighborhood is safe, you can never be too careful. I've had my share of run-ins with troublemakers in the past, including a physical altercation and a package theft incident. While it's a common problem, package theft is a concern in this area. One more thing to watch out for: dog owners who don't clean up after their pets. Every morning, you'll likely spot dog waste on the sidewalk or near the train station or supermarket. My pet peeve? Dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be sure to keep your shoes clean!",
            "Lately, I've been noticing that my neighborhood lacks sidewalks, and my house happens to be situated at the top of the steepest hill in the area. Locals have nicknamed it the \"workout hill\" since joggers often use it as part of their daily routine. Due to the absence of sidewalks on my street, everyone walks on the road, which can be hazardous, especially with potholes scattered here and there. The telephone and electric wires around the block appear tattered, and constant storms cause branches and debris to knock down the power lines, necessitating frequent repairs. It's a common sight to see patchwork repairs on these wires. The landscape is dominated by tall evergreen trees, but residents tend to cut them down to preserve the ocean view. Many houses are built with large glass-fronted second stories to take in the breathtaking view of the bay. Watching the sunset is a treat, with the water getting lit up from below, and the sky turning orange. However, most days are overcast, resulting in a damp atmosphere and a lot of haze. Moss grows profusely on everything, including roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked for a month, and when I returned, it was a green, moss-covered mess that took three hours to clean off. Our neighborhood is relatively quiet, with not many children around, except for a school a short distance away. Mostly retired people reside in our area, and instead of kids, you often see dogs roaming the streets or racing each other. They're quite common in our neighborhood, and if you leave a door or window open, you risk having them sneak into your house. I once found one in my living room and had to shoo it out the front door. Rabbits are also abundant in the area, and while they can be a nuisance to gardeners as they dig up plant roots and burrow into lawns, my cats enjoy hunting them. We also have our fair share of birds, including small sparrows, hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle that swoops by before being chased away by crows. If you're willing to hike downhill to the waterfront, you can find a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. The shoreline isn't extensive, but the rocks along the shore are fun to throw into the water. The bay is relatively narrow, and on most days, you can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist.",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area in a small town in Tennessee, surrounded by state highways that bring a moderate amount of traffic to our quiet street. Our neighborhood is generally stable, with not many new residents moving in, so I've gotten accustomed to knowing most of my neighbors. Daily life revolves around yard work and daily routines. In winter, we enjoy sledding down the hill on our side street, and since our house is located at the front of our street, we have a clear view of everyone passing by. We're always on the lookout for unfamiliar vehicles. Some neighbors take walks for exercise or to walk their dogs, while kids can be seen riding their bikes. We spend most of our time at home working from our house, with my wife and our two daughters – aged eleven and fourteen – keeping me company. As a result, everyone in the neighborhood is familiar with our coming and going. We're not ones to shy away from spending time outdoors, even on rainy days. Occasionally, we fire up the barbecue on our back deck, filling the air with a pleasant smell. The sound of lawn mowers is a regular occurrence from March to October, a reminder that our neighborhood was once a wooded area and still retains its lush tree cover. This brings a lot of shade, but also a lot of leaves in the fall, requiring us to rake and burn them annually. I must admit, I enjoy the smell of burning leaves, a sure sign that fall has arrived. Lately, the lack of winter has made the season feel like a prolonged fall. Our garage, located at the back of our house, sees minimal use, except when I'm working on my truck or other projects, which allows me to stay connected to the neighborhood. Holidays are generally quiet, with occasional visits from out-of-town family members during Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, and Christmas, resulting in an influx of cars on our street. Overall, I'm content with living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be an ideal neighborhood.",
            "My home is situated smack in the middle of a high desert landscape, where dirt and dust seem to rule supreme. Anyone who hasn't experienced living here wouldn't grasp the perpetual sight of brown hues and the sense of awe when spotting a lawn, which is usually a result of extensive maintenance. When I first moved here in the 90s, houses were scattered far and wide, giving it a more secluded feel. Although it's not much different now, with new developments sprouting up, our neighborhood is slowly transforming into a bustling urban area, just like many other places. The people here are generally friendly, but, like any city, it has its share of good and not-so-good aspects. I've been fortunate to be surrounded by kind-hearted elderly folks, making my neighborhood a more pleasant place to live. Our local stores are mostly chains, such as Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you're craving fresh produce, you'll have to venture out. The dominant industries in my city appear to be construction, as there's still plenty of open space left to be developed. This prospect unsettles me a bit, as I prefer things as they are. I left behind the hustle and bustle of a big city and don't want to go back. Speaking of construction, my job as a drywall and T-bar installer is located in this very field. What I appreciate about my home is the diverse wildlife. The high desert is a magnet for visitors, not just for its breathtaking beauty but also for the unique ecosystems it supports. It's essential for human residents to learn about the non-human inhabitants of this environment to coexist peacefully and responsibly. My family and I have grown accustomed to the local wildlife, and my kids are particularly fond of lizards and desert insects. As I write this, they're outside trying to catch various specimens. When it comes to attractions, we have a few notable ones. Victorville is an excellent destination for families looking to experience the desert. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with the San Bernardino County Fair, which offers an unforgettable experience with a mix of activities and fun. Visit nearby Wrightwood to witness the snow-capped mountains and take part in winter sports to cap off your visit. For those interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem, the Victor Valley Museum is a must-visit, featuring geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of Victorville's development and growth.",
            "When people ask me to describe my neighborhood, I give answers that are, in a way, quite distinct. You see, my neighbors aren't just the folks who live next door, but the people I share my college campus with. The dormitory I stay in is my community, and the surrounding campus is my neighborhood too, albeit to a lesser degree. Now, you might think my situation's a bit unusual, but my neighborhood still shares some common traits with what you'd expect from a typical neighborhood. It's got houses, people, stores, and parks – the basics, really. Let's start with the \"houses\" in my neighborhood, although they're a bit different from what you'd find elsewhere. In my neck of the woods, we've got three types of housing: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory houses. First off, the apartments usually have 2-4 people sharing a room, with 4-6 rooms per floor, and about 20 people living in each building on average. Then there are the actual houses, which are mostly 2-4 bedroom setups rented by alumni, but there aren't many of those around. Last but not least, we've got the dorm rooms, which are the most common type of housing here, with two people sharing a room, except in some cases. With housing covered, let's move on to the people. My school's all about being diverse, and that's reflected in my neighborhood's makeup. We've got people from all walks of life and cultures living here, with the professional staff in the houses, new students in the dorms, and older students in the apartments. Talking about the people here would take too long, so let's skip to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. As my school is basically a self-contained neighborhood, we've got plenty of stores and a single park. The stores offer a mix of regular dining options and the school's own brand of clothing and grocery stores, so you can find everything you need within our neighborhood boundaries. Our park is a playground for all the diverse folks in my neighborhood, kept clean and safe thanks to everyone's efforts.",
            "I've been living in this neighborhood for about 10 years now, so I guess I can share some of my experiences. When I first moved here from Riverdale to Stockbridge, I was really down in the dumps. I cried because I missed my old place and the people there, but my parents wanted the best for my little sister and me, so we had to move to a better area with a nicer house and a better school. Looking back, it was a tough transition, but I slowly got used to it and made some new friends and acquaintances in school. I didn't really get to know my neighbors that well, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis, who lived right next door. They've been like family to me over the years, and I'm grateful for their presence in my life. I still remember the time I went to Mr. Glen's wedding - it was a blast, and I'm looking forward to having a similar celebration when I get married someday and can give my future wife the life she deserves. At the wedding, I was lucky enough to catch the little strap that Ms. Veda threw off her leg, but unfortunately, I missed the flowers. I had a great time dancing with Marsharii, Mr. Glen's daughter, but I haven't seen her since. I hope she's doing well and achieving her goals. This neighborhood can be confusing, but with the help of GPS, I've been able to explore it more. I've hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis, and we used to spend hours playing video games and just enjoying life. Sometimes I'd go to the park and connect with nature, which helps calm me down and brings me a sense of peace. I also like to visit the park and practice my balance with sticks I bought from Home Depot, and I sometimes bring my bokken wooden sword along. I enjoy doing what I love. There are also a basketball and tennis court nearby, although I haven't played in a while, it's nice to know they're there in case I want to pick it up again. My dad used to take me and my best friend to play tennis with Mr. Graves, and we always had a great time, even though they pushed us hard. I've had a lot of fun in this neighborhood, and there are plenty of stories to share, but these are the ones that really stand out to me. I'm excited to see what the future holds.",
            "Living in my neighborhood is pretty ideal for me because it's just a short walk to the college I attend. Most of the apartments around me are decently priced, and there are some affordable bars and restaurants nearby that I enjoy going to. However, one of the bars just got a new name and seems to be priced a bit higher, but the quality of service and drinks is still good. The crowd is generally nice, consisting of college students and low-income residents. The area is also quite family-friendly, with an elementary school nearby that's within walking distance. I don't really know my neighbors, but I'm a bit amused by how they often smoke weed - the management even installed an air freshener unit in front of their door, which my boyfriend and I found quite funny. It's almost like they're being mocked. The buildings in my area are mostly old but have been renovated inside. Down the street, there are some brand new apartments, but I'm not a fan because I heard the construction wasn't great and the rent is still quite high. I think it's a scam, but since they're close to campus, the management gets away with it. There's a super cheap restaurant nearby that serves food on paper plates and microwaves most of their dishes. Across from it is a gas station that's not exactly a great place to work. Thanks to some city funding, the road was repaved last summer, making it look a bit nicer with a big sidewalk and lots of grass. However, my apartment building is surrounded by a lot of trees, which I think is nice. They've cut down a few, but there are still plenty more than in the surrounding areas. Behind my building is a tree line and another apartment complex. The street behind mine is 43rd, and it's not as nice as 42nd where I live. The sidewalks are in bad shape, and most of the buildings look run-down. The street is lined with trees, but it's probably just to hide the state of the buildings. There have been some issues with crime in the area, particularly at an apartment complex on 43rd, but I don't think it's entirely their fault. There are other apartments across from me with similar problems and a transient population. Despite this, I like living here because it's affordable and convenient, with the university nearby and two bus stops for easy access to the store and downtown.",
            "I live in a neighborhood with a unique charm. It's made up of identical-looking duplexes on a cul-de-sac, each painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. The friendly vibe is palpable, with most neighbors getting along and even chatting with each other on their driveways in the evenings. It's a refreshing escape from the digital world we're often immersed in, like stepping back in time. We're surrounded by lush fields, trees, and the vast blue sky with puffy white clouds, creating a serene atmosphere. However, this season brought some unexpected challenges – tornado warnings and actual sirens that forced us to seek shelter. I was right there in my bathtub, clutching my little dog and my purse, while my bigger dog stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The neighborhood was eerily quiet, except for the sound of hail pounding the ground. As the storm passed, the temperature dropped drastically, causing the road to steam up. The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement, and as I looked up, a beautiful double rainbow appeared in the sky. I quickly grabbed my camera and snapped some amazing shots to share with my friends and family on Facebook. They were just as amazed as I was. The streets remained quiet for a while until people returned home, and then it was back to normal – kids playing outside while their parents cooked dinner. I'm so grateful to have found this lovely neighborhood, especially after moving from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I adore the Southern accent and the friendly people. My two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment might look the same as the others on the outside, but each one has its unique interior. Some are surprisingly small, and I'm still trying to figure out why. I love taking long walks through the big field behind my home and strolling down to the pond, where I often spot deer and listen to the enchanting song of the bullfrog. It's a great place to live, just 40 minutes outside Charlotte. Every morning starts with the sweet sound of roosters crowing from the nearby farms, giving me a sense of living in a small village community. Even the nearby farm has a lovable donkey that brays in the evening to remind us he's there. I feel so lucky to have found this gem of a neighborhood.",
            "My family and I moved into this neighborhood a little while before I started eighth grade. It took some time for me to adjust and make friends, but I ended up becoming close to two neighbours, one of whom lives just two doors down from me and the other on the same street. Unfortunately, they're no longer living here now, but the memories we made are still vivid. The people who've been here since I first moved in are still around, which is nice. My neighbourhood is pretty typical, with rows of two-story houses, and every weekend when the weather's warm, you can hear kids playing outside. It's usually pretty quiet here most weekdays, though. I've never had any issues with my neighbours, and I feel comfortable trusting them. I've ordered plenty of packages online and never had one go missing from my porch. There's a park about a minute's walk from my house, where I have lots of fond memories. I used to play basketball, football, and baseball with the other guys in the neighbourhood, but one of my worst memories is also from there – I got elbowed in the nose while playing football! Despite that, the good times far outweigh the bad. Nowadays, when I visit the park, it's usually to spend time with my cousin's younger kids. They love playing on the swings and slides, and it brings a smile to my face seeing them have so much fun. The park holds a special place in my heart, and every time I go there, I'm filled with nostalgia. \n\nMy neighbourhood is pretty diverse, with loads of different food options nearby. Within a one-mile radius, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, with the rise of food delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash, many people just order in instead of going out. The most popular spots are usually the fast food chains, which are common in most suburban neighbourhoods. There are plenty of pizza places too. The local stores have everything you could need, including multiple dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store – a popular chain in the Midwest. Some of the stores even cater to specific tastes, like an Indian-owned shop where you can buy ingredients for homemade Indian dishes or ready-made food. Overall, I'm really happy with my neighbourhood. When I see the horror stories on social media and the news about people's experiences with their neighbours, I feel grateful for mine.",
            "My neighborhood is a humble little town in South Carolina. It may not stand out, but it has a significant impact on the region's agriculture. Johnston proudly claims to be the Peach Capital of the World, and this pride is reflected on the town's welcoming sign. The town is mainly composed of farmland with peach trees and cattle dominating the landscape. Houses are scattered, with most being two-story homes featuring either metal or gray roofs to combat the scorching summer heat. Those situated outside the main part of town are often farther back from the road, allowing for the front fields to be used for animals and crops. The main part of town is marked by a single four-way stop light, where you'll find the town's only stores. For those craving convenience food, there's Hong Kong, a family-run Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, but it sadly closed down not too long ago. You'll also find Maxwell and Halford Drug, a small family-owned pharmacy famous for their Cherry Coca-Cola. A small, but pricey grocery store called IGA is the town's only supermarket, but many residents prefer to visit the Walmart in nearby Batesburg-Leesville for their grocery needs. The most popular store in town, however, is Dollar General, which sells a wide range of everyday essentials and is always bustling from opening to closing time. There's also Possibilities Furniture & More, a cozy furniture store run by a well-known local woman who hires movers to deliver purchased items. Next door to the furniture store is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a small pet groomers offering various services like daycare, boarding, and grooming. Both the doctor's and veterinary practice are situated outside the main part of town, but they're both well-equipped to serve the community. Johnston Elementary School is the town's only school, and students attend middle and high school in the neighboring town after completing fifth grade. Although there aren't many parks or entertainment options, the town is currently developing a 2.5-acre recreational area to provide families with more opportunities for outdoor activities and attract new residents. Despite its simplicity, Johnston is a charming town that can easily go unnoticed in the blink of an eye.",
            "The first time I heard about my area, I was tuning into a podcast about people who had vanished. It caught me off guard, as almost every apartment in the neighborhood was being sold for over $1000 a month. I had never heard anything about it, nor had any of my friends. I guess that's what happens when you're struggling. I know a few of my friends have trouble sleeping at night because things are just so expensive. But we've learned to be frugal over the years. You start to get used to the smell of flea market toys and old clothes that have been tucked away for a while. You smell less in adulthood, and you might even start smoking or just get used to things being a certain way. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty old magazines stacked on an old piano, and it gets stuck in the leather even after you wash it. Our neighborhood has three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start from the far side, you can visit two charity shops, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curio shop. Downtown is crowded, with cars and people everywhere in the morning, but you wouldn't know it in the thrift stores. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the stores are always quiet. It's a great place to waste an afternoon. Every year, there are more and more cars and people flooding the city. It's developing, they say. One of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery calls it home, and it's still showing signs of growth. It reminds me of New York. Everyone's got their own goals, and nobody really bothers you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep your shell as long as you want, and the city will just roll with it. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have more of a community of friends than a bunch of strangers living in an apartment. We come together for birthdays, funerals, and when we need each other. In some ways, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors, and they treat me pretty well. I try to keep my apartment clean and leave them food, and they do the same for me. We exchange mail and it's nice to see them. I think they enjoy my presence just as much as I do theirs. Despite living in a massive, impersonal modernist sprawl, it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't completely mess up my life.",
            "My neighborhood is a classic example of cookie cutter suburbia. I live in an area where the presence of a homeowner's association is strongly felt. As soon as you step in, you'll notice rows of perfectly maintained single-family homes, thanks to the HOA. The front yards are surprisingly uniform, with a small patch of grass, decorative pebbles, and short driveways. Every now and then, you'll spot a small tree or two. It's also common to see two-car garages on most homes. The roads are immaculate, with newly paved concrete and no potholes in sight. While the majority of houses are single-story, a few have two stories. One thing that stands out is the unique mailbox system. Instead of having individual mailboxes in front of each house, we have a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street, which requires a key to access your specific box. There are also two larger lockers for packages, all thanks to the HOA's emphasis on uniformity. Our neighborhood is situated on the outskirts of the nearby city, making it a mix of rural and suburban living. As a result, we have plenty of space for various amenities. There are multiple community pools, all well-maintained and gated, where anyone living here can swim. We also have walking trails where you can take your dog for a walk or enjoy an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get some exercise; simply running around the neighborhood will suffice.\n\nThe community is predominantly made up of retirees, who make up a significant portion of the residents. It's an extremely safe area, with everyone looking out for one another. Mixed in with the retirees are a few middle-aged and young professionals. Our city is surprisingly large in terms of population but has a small-town feel. We have all the amenities you'd expect, including a single mall that may not be huge but gets the job done. It takes me around 15 minutes to drive to any major destination, but once I arrive, I'm greeted with a variety of stores to choose from. We have high-end grocery stores with organic options to bargain outlets with limited selection and minimal staff to keep costs low. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have many nice amenities like pools and walking trails, and while we're not right next door to shopping, it's just a short drive to get to any major chain store.",
            "I reside in a small Midwestern town just on the outskirts of a major city, nestled in the suburbs. My neighborhood, situated on the east side, is considered one of the economically disadvantaged areas of the town. The property values are relatively low, with many houses being rented or owned by families with lower incomes. Yet, it's not an uninviting place. My neighbors are generally friendly folks who greet me with a smile when I walk down the street. Although the crime rates are slightly higher than in other parts of town, they're still manageable. Over the past decade, there have been some violent incidents, including a few shootings and a homicide, within a few blocks of my home. I recall our next-door neighbors losing their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Thankfully, our family hasn't been directly affected by crime, except for the occasional missing item from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. Our town has been significantly impacted by the \"opioid epidemic\" that has affected many parts of the United States. However, there are various resources available to combat this issue, including rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those struggling with addiction. Despite these challenges, our town has many appealing qualities. My son's elementary school boasts an excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. He has not faced any bullying, thanks to the positive atmosphere of the school, and he genuinely enjoys attending. We have an active PTO that organizes numerous events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Given that over 20% of our town's population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. No child or family is treated as inferior due to financial constraints, and the costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are relatively low. The City Council and staff have made efforts to improve our town's appearance, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side, where I reside, tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for my neighbors and me. Overall, I appreciate living in this town. People are generally kind, the schools are excellent, there are sufficient shopping options to meet our needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it's comfortable and suitable. We've lived here for over 16 years, and it's hard to imagine calling anywhere else home.",
            "My neighborhood is a melting pot of culture, perched on a hill amidst a cluster of buildings steeped in history. I reside in a 7-story apartment building, directly opposite the old theater, and just a block away is this charming arcade bar that attracts a diverse crowd on warm summer evenings. On weekends in June and July, a long queue often forms outside its doors. Just a few blocks up is the city's nearest park, a sprawling green space considering its location in this part of town. The park is surrounded by concrete, with tall stairs carved into the wall. During the harsh winter months, homeless people set up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and the wide steps. This strategic placement keeps them relatively warmer, despite the lack of snow, and allows them easy access to the nearby family center, where they can bathe and shower. What I cherish about my city, though, isn't its historic architecture or the grand buildings that dot the hillsides. It's the community that truly makes it special. You see, Hilltop was once notorious for gang violence on the West Coast. Even decades later, stories of the federal government and DEA swooping in to clean up the streets still circulate. The people haven't forgotten. These stories are passed down through generations, from the original residents to newcomers like me, as a reminder of the neighborhood's rough past. Despite its reputation, the community works hard to maintain its cleanliness and care about what goes on in their city and on their block. They even caution outsiders not to venture out after dark, a warning that still carries the weight of its troubled history. As a 'not-quite-white' girl, I feel a connection to this community. Perhaps it's because I'm dark enough to blend in, or maybe Hilltop has accepted me as one of their own, someone who's aware of the ingrained racism and biases that plague our society. I know one thing: Hilltop will always be my home. I feel alive strolling through the streets at night, surrounded by people who've shown me kindness and empathy more often than not. It's a place where laundromats stay open late to let me charge my phone when I'm caught in the rain, and where strangers have handed me money and told me I'm beautiful and valuable, even when I felt invisible.",
            "I live in the heart of Rural America, nestled in the quaint town of Michigan. My home is surrounded by the picturesque beauty of farmland and charming tourist cities. Life here is simple, with no big city malls, chain stores like Wal-mart or Target, or restaurants like Applebee's within reach. You have to drive to get anywhere, but the journey is worth it, as I'm blessed to live in one of the most breathtaking places on earth, surrounded by two magnificent lakes - Lake Michigan to the one side and Lake Charlevoix to the other. Every corner of our small town offers a serene beach to dip your toes in, making it a haven for those seeking tranquility. My neighborhood is a classic example of small-town living, with houses that reflect the essence of Middle America. These aren't cookie-cutter homes, but rather unique, older residences that have been lovingly updated and remodeled over the years. Many of these homes boast basements, some of which are fully-fledged and open to the eye from the street. The neighborhood is a kaleidoscope of colors, with houses painted in every hue imaginable. Most homes have spacious yards, complete with trampolines, playsets, gardens, and fences for pets. Our community is comprised of hardworking individuals who strive to make a living and raise their families. On any given day, you'll see kids playing in the streets, people strolling their dogs, biking, or rollerblading. Neighbors know one another, and it's not uncommon to see a friendly wave or a smile from a passerby. The lawns are meticulously maintained, with green grass and well-trimmed plants adding to the neighborhood's charm. While it may not be the most stunning neighborhood you've ever seen, it's one that exudes a sense of belonging and a promise of a safe haven. Within walking distance, you'll find the county sheriff's department, the health department, and the recycling center, all of which serve our community. Our small town is also home to baseball and softball fields, where you can hear the excitement of the game, and a nearby airport where small planes take off and land. You can stroll to the local ice cream parlor, and if you're feeling adventurous, take a short walk downtown. The best part? My kids can ride their bikes to the nearby park, just 8 blocks away. It's a wonderful place to call home."
