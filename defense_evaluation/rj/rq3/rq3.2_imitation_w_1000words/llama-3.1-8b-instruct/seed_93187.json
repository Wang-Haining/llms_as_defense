            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "My city is a melting pot, with a diverse range of communities living together in the same area. Residential areas seem to pop up randomly alongside shops, restaurants, and entertainment spots, creating a lively atmosphere. Everywhere you look, there are new eateries to try and stores to explore. While some of these stores are big-name brands, others are smaller, independent boutiques that line the streets and are often within walking distance from quiet neighborhoods. The place is also dotted with nearby parks, which are always bustling with families with young kids. When it comes to the people, my neighborhood is a true microcosm of the world, with a thriving LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a significant number of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union all living in the same area. If you venture a bit further out, you'll find even more diverse communities, each with their own little enclaves, such as Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia. However, these areas are only a stone's throw away, yet the traffic can be a nightmare, especially during rush hour, when a 10-mile journey can take two hours. It's not surprising that hardly anyone walks anywhere, given the sheer size of the city and the congested roads. The result is some of the worst traffic in the world, and finding parking spots can be a real challenge. Paradoxically, the city has seen a lot of construction in recent years, with new apartment buildings sprouting up left and right. While this might make it a popular destination, many residents are worried about the influx of new people and the subsequent increase in traffic. When it comes to housing, there's a wide range of options to choose from, from large apartment buildings to single-family homes, duplexes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Even within my immediate neighborhood, I've noticed a diverse range of housing options, and the people who live here are just as varied, with different ages and backgrounds.

            "At first glance, it may seem unassuming, tucked away behind a strip of shops - not the kind of place you'd expect to find homes, let alone thriving communities. But venture behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk past the hotels that sit vacant most of the year, except for the occasional summer family gathering, and you'll stumble upon a hidden gem. This otherwise unassuming area is actually home to a bustling neighborhood, where apartment complexes line the streets like intricately arranged building blocks.\n\nOne of these complexes has made headlines for some unsavory dealings, but we'll leave that aside for now - appearances can be deceiving.

Students filter in, sipping coffee and yawning as they start their day at 7 am, while commuters behind them grumble at the traffic congestion.\n\nThe road intersects with another residential street, lined with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for those with broken bones.

            "As we drove past the endless cornfields that filled the horizon, she asked, \"Where are we?\" I knew she'd be surprised by the vast open space. She was from a town where the convenience store was just a 5-minute walk from her house, and she'd never seen so much emptiness. I shared with her what it's like growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood where I came from. The road unwinds like a ribbon through a sea of corn, accompanied by a quarry that's home to a calm lake. Just beyond it lies my home in a small development where houses stand proudly with their brick and stucco facades. Each house boasts at least half an acre of land, which we all take great pride in maintaining. Every spring, the landscape transforms with an explosion of colorful flowers and trees that change colors with each passing season. The driveways are lined with sleek Mercedes-Benz luxury cars, glistening in the sunlight after a refreshing wash. As we continue down the road, my grey stucco home comes into view, and you'll likely catch a glimpse of my friendly Korean neighbor, always tending to his lawn with a warm smile. He spends his days mowing the grass and singing over the hum of his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Everyone in the neighborhood adores him, but beneath his friendly demeanor lies a rich history - he was once a doctor and has lost some of his wit as the years have passed. He blends in with the grass and his trusty mower, a sight that brings smiles to our faces.

Across the rustic wooden bridge lies an untouched haven, teeming with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was where I spent most of my childhood, creating memories with friends and siblings - building tree forts, chasing after wild animals (or at least, trying to!), and enjoying the simple joys of childhood. Our winters can be harsh, but there's nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a lush green landscape to a barren wilderness, with the once-vibrant flowers and trees standing as skeletal reminders of the changing seasons. And when snow falls, a winter wonderland appears overnight, complete with snow angels made by my little sister and snowmen that stand guard over our little domain. My sister and I may have fought often as kids, but during the winter, snowballs were our trusty companions, and our backyard transformed into an arsenal of forts and branches. In our own little world, we were carefree kids, living in a winter wonderland where nothing else mattered.",
            "To truly grasp the essence of Portland, Oregon, you need to grasp the concept of \"weird\". The unofficial town motto, scribbled on the back of a building that's a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and a little bit of a lawbreaker, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". Some see this as a nostalgic call to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's - a place that was lesser-known, more affordable, and gave rise to unique and innovative subcultures. Others see it as an invitation - come to Portland, where you'll still be called weird, but this time as a compliment. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the constant construction of condominiums for these Californians, Portland remains weird. Being weird doesn't mean we're always accepting, but it means we accept things that others wouldn't normally accept. Weird doesn't mean we're devoid of modern conveniences and modern struggles. Like everywhere else, we buy most of our goods from China. Being weird comes in a million forms, a million ways of being not normal, but Portland's got plenty of normal too. Portland has yoga, hipsters, and business professionals. Maybe being weird just means we take all this less seriously. In my neighborhood, like many Portland neighborhoods, the streets are lined with colorful houses, home gardens bursting with flowers, herbs, and vegetables, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are essentially cardboard containers or plastic bags with unwanted items, but sometimes you'll stumble upon something magical - a treasure tailored to the person wandering by. Free boxes can contain anything from clothes and books to anything else you can imagine. The thrill of strolling through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about, from my perspective, but I'm just one of the thousands of weird Portlanders. Some people I live among wouldn't dare pick through the contents of a box on the sidewalk. They'd rather attend goat yoga (yes, yoga with live goats) or a Timbers match (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things and pursue their passions, or at least dream about pursuing them, while having one too many drinks at the bar. Unfortunately, Portland also has a drug problem, which stems from underlying mental health issues, and the constant drizzle and cloudy skies might be contributing to it. The city also struggles with homelessness, and no one seems to know the solution. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, which are better than in most parts of the country, but they're still insufficient. The non-homeless population is torn between compassion and disdain. In this, we're not weird at all.",
            "The mountains stand tall and unyielding in the north, their presence a constant reminder of the passage of time as the sun rises and sets. Their solidity is unwavering, unchanging despite my preoccupation with life's everyday struggles. It's as if they silently demand my attention on the most trying days, offering me a chance to temporarily lay my anxious thoughts to rest and find solace in their unshakeable strength. My journey here started when I first began my university studies, and it was the mountains north of campus that initially drew me in. While the university itself boasts its own share of breathtaking scenery, from buildings to ponds and trees that have a piece of my heart, the mountains hold a special place. The town is lovely in its own right, with its charming cafés where I've spent countless hours fueled by coffee and cram sessions. A short walk or bus ride takes me to the downtown area, where the faded bricks of old buildings envelop me in a sense of history and antiquity. The contrast between this laid-back atmosphere and the bustling urban city nearby is a big part of what makes this town so endearing. This dichotomy of worlds existing side by side makes it easy to create lasting memories, each tied to a specific part of town. Whether it's strolling past the rusted swings in the park after a long night of studying or racing through the downtown streets to catch a movie at the cinema, every moment is a treasure. However, as with any place, there are also memories that are harder to cherish, memories that remind us of life's complexities. The ponds, in particular, can be a poignant place for reflection and introspection, especially during those late-night existential crises when the world seems overwhelming. As I wander past the pond, the park, and the quaint houses that remind me of the comforts of suburbia, I find myself drawn towards the main street. It's there, under the golden glow of the sunrise painting the sky, that I catch sight of the mountains in all their glory. Their stature and presence are a constant reminder of my own strength and perseverance, and in that moment, I am reminded of the importance of staying the course.",
            "If you're planning a trip to Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you won't have a hard time finding it - public transport is easy to access and a super popular mode of transport in New York City. Bensonhurt's a fairly urban area, so you'll still get that New York City vibe. When you're there, get ready to see loads of Asian stores around every corner. Over the years, Bensonhurt's become a hotspot for Asians, and you'll notice an Asian-owned store every few blocks as you walk around. Supermarkets and laundromats are the most popular ones - they're super convenient, with great food quality, super cheap prices, and super efficient services. Just around my place, there are four Asian supermarkets within a 2-minute walk from each other - talk about convenience! Now, don't get me wrong, Bensonhurt's not all Asian - it's super diverse, with immigrants and their American-born kids living here. Most of the big businesses in the area are Asian-owned, but you'll also find a renovated park nearby with loads of facilities - 10 basketball courts, a big field for soccer or baseball, 4 handball courts, swings, a kids' playground, and even a water fountain for the summer. Since we're in New York City, you'll see a mix of everything here - all sorts of people getting along just fine. Unlike the city's corporate buildings, Bensonhurt's mostly got co-op living and condo apartments, with a few two-family houses here and there. The people are generally nice, but be prepared for some noise pollution - you'll hear cars blasting music and speeding by, and some folks can be a bit rowdy. If you're visiting at night, just be aware of your surroundings - the area's generally safe, but you never know when you might run into someone causing trouble. I've had my share of run-ins with troublemakers in the past, so be cautious. Plus, keep an eye out for package thieves - they're a thing here. One last thing - people don't always follow the rules about cleaning up after their dogs, so be prepared to see dog waste on the streets. My biggest pet peeve? Dog waste everywhere I go - keep your shoes clean and watch where you step!",
            "Living in my area, I've come to realize that sidewalks are a rare sight. We have a really steep hill in our neighborhood, often referred to as the \"workout hill\" due to the numerous joggers who use it as part of their daily routine. With no sidewalks on my street, pedestrians are forced to walk on the road, which can be hazardous due to the potholes and uneven surface. Our road is also lined with worn-out telephone and electric wires that look like they're on their last leg. The frequent storms and heavy rainfall in our area often cause branches and debris to knock down the power lines, leading to a patchwork of repairs. The scene is dominated by tall evergreen trees, but strangely, people here tend to see them as a nuisance, cutting them down to get a clear view of the ocean. Many houses are built high up on the hill, with expansive glass windows to take in the breathtaking view of the bay. It's truly stunning during sunset, when the water below seems to glow and the sky turns a vibrant orange. However, this sight is often obstructed by the overcast skies that prevail most days, casting a haze over the scenery. As a result, moss grows abundantly on everything it can find - roofs, cars, and railings alike. I once left my car parked for a month, and when I returned, it was covered in a thick layer of moss that took three hours to remove. Our neighborhood is home to a few schools, but it's mostly populated by older folks, many of whom have retired. Dogs are a common sight, with many owners letting them roam freely in their lawns or racing them down the street. Be careful not to leave your door or window open, or you might find a curious canine sneaking in. I once found one lounging in my living room, and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits also run wild in our area, and while some are quite large, they're a nuisance to gardeners who see them digging up plants and burrowing into lawns. My cats, on the other hand, seem to enjoy the thrill of the hunt, and have managed to drive most of them out of our neighborhood. We also have a variety of birds, including small sparrows and hummingbirds, as well as the occasional hawk or eagle that swoops by until the crows chase it off. While there are no stores nearby, a short hike down to the waterfront reveals a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. The beach itself isn't impressive, but the rocks along the shore make for a fun spot to skip stones into the water. The bay is relatively narrow, and on most days, you can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist.",
            "Me and my family, my wife and two daughters, ages 11 and 14, live in a typical suburban area in a small town in Tennessee. Our street is like a main artery connecting two state highways, which means we get more traffic than we'd like, but overall it's a peaceful neighborhood. Not many people move in or out, so I'm familiar with most of the folks around here. Everyone keeps busy with yard work and daily chores. In the winters, we enjoy sledding down a hill on our side street, right at the front corner of our street where our house is located. We see everything that's going on from our house since it's a central spot on the street. When we see a strange car, we take note of it. Some neighbors go for walks or walk their dogs, while the kids ride their bikes. With us working from home, we're often around. It's just the four of us, so I'd say our neighbors are used to seeing us come and go. We like to get outside, even on rainy days. Sometimes we grill on our back deck, and the smell of barbecue is always a delight. There's always someone cutting grass around here, so we hear lawn mowers almost daily from March to October, when the grass slows down. Our neighborhood was originally wooded, so we have plenty of trees, providing shade but also a lot of leaves in the fall, which means raking and burning them every year. I love the smell of burning leaves, signaling the start of fall. Lately, we haven't been experiencing much winter, so it just feels like an extended fall. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we usually use the back door, unless someone knocks on the front door, which is rare. When I'm working on my truck or projects in the garage with the doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, things get pretty quiet around here. We get some visitors from out of town on Thanksgiving and other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas, which brings more cars around. Overall, I really like living here. If it weren't for the through street, it'd be perfect.",
            "I live in a neighborhood smack in the middle of the high desert, surrounded by dirt and nothing much else. Unless you've experienced living here, you can't really grasp the feeling of seeing brown everywhere you look. If you do come across a lawn, you know that person is shelling out a fortune on lawn care. When I first moved here in the 90s, houses were spread out, but it wasn't as crowded as it is now. There are a lot more people and new additions, making the area look more and more like a city every day. Most places are changing the same way, I guess. The people here are generally friendly, but like any city, you've got your ups and downs. I'm lucky to live in a pretty nice neighborhood surrounded by friendly old folks. The shops around here are mostly chain stores like Food for Less and Smart and Final. If you want to go organic, you'll have to travel a bit. I rarely see any Whole Foods or similar stores around. The dominant profession in our city, from what I've observed, is construction. I think it's because our city is still pretty undeveloped, leaving plenty of wide open spaces to build on. To be honest, that scares me a bit - I prefer things the way they are. I left a big city behind, and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction, that's the field where I work full-time as a drywall and T-bar installer. What I love about my home is the variety of animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, including its stark beauty. The unique high desert climate and topography create challenging ecosystems that need our protection and are home to diverse wildlife. As a resident, it's essential to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment with us, so we can coexist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted well to the local wildlife. My three kids are obsessed with lizards and desert bugs, and as I write this, they're outside trying to catch different specimens. As for attractions, we have a few. Victorville is a great place for families to experience the desert, offering a unique experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with the annual San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will add a great mix of activities and fun to your visit, showcasing the Victorville way. Head to nearby Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to cap off your visit. If you're interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem, check out the Victor Valley Museum, which features geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of Victorville's development and industry.",
            "Hmmm...when people ask me to describe my neighborhood, my answer's gonna be pretty different, I'm sure. Most others who answer this question are probably homeowners living their own lives, but I'm a bit of an exception. My neighborhood's actually the college campus I live on, and my dorm-mates are basically my community. The surrounding campus is also part of my neighborhood, but to a lesser extent. Despite being a bit unusual, my neighborhood shares some similarities with the usual ideas about neighborhoods. Like any typical neighborhood, my campus has houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's start with the 'houses' in my neighborhood. By the way, there are three types of housing here – apartments, normal houses, and dormitories. First, in the apartments, each room usually has 2-4 people, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. Each building can have about 2 floors, so that's around 20 people living in each one. Second, there are normal houses that are available for school affiliates to rent – usually 2-4 bedrooms. However, they're quite rare, as they're not the most efficient option. Lastly, there are the typical dorm rooms where hundreds of students live, usually 2 people sharing a room, except in some cases. These are the most common type of housing here. Now that we've covered housing, let's move on to the people. My school's all about diversity, and this is reflected in the neighborhood. We have people from all sorts of cultures and ages living here. The professionals usually stay in the houses, while the new students live in the dorms and the older students live in apartments. Talking about the people here is a bit hard to sum up, so let's just move on to the stores and parks. Since my school is pretty much its own neighborhood, it has plenty of stores and a single park. The stores have a mix of dining options and the school's unique clothing and grocery stores. You can pretty much find everything you need within the neighborhood. The park's a playground for all the diverse people here, kept clean and crime-free by everyone in the neighborhood.",
            "I've been living in this neighborhood for almost 10 years now, and I think it's time for me to share some of my experiences. When I first moved here from Riverdale to Stockbridge, I was really sad - I missed my old home and the people there. But my parents wanted the best for my sister and me, so we moved to a new area with better housing and a better school. It was a big change, but over time, I got used to it and made some new friends and even some enemies at school. However, I never really got to know my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis, who lived right next door. They've been like family to me, and I appreciate them a lot. I remember attending Mr. Glen's wedding, and it was an amazing experience - I even caught the little strap from Ms. Veda's leg when she threw it away! We all danced and had a great time, and I'm looking forward to having a similar celebration someday when I'm successful and can give my future wife the life she deserves. I also had a great time with Marsharii, Mr. Glen's daughter, but I haven't seen her since then. I hope she's doing well. Our neighborhood is like a maze, but now that I have a GPS, I can explore it more. I've only gone so far, and most of the time, it's been with my friends Kason and Curtis - we used to love playing video games together and just enjoying life. Sometimes, I'd go to the park and appreciate nature, which really calms me down. It gives me a sense of peace and tranquility. I'd also bring sticks from Home Depot and practice my balance, and I even bring my bokken wooden sword if I can. It's a lot of fun doing what I love. We also have a basketball and tennis court, although I haven't played in a long time - it's nice to have the option to pick it up again if I want to. My dad taught me and my best friend tennis with Mr. Graves, and we always had a great time - they worked us hard, but we always enjoyed it. There are a lot of good memories here, but these are some of the ones that stand out to me, and I think the best times are yet to come!",
            "I'm pretty lucky to be living near the college I attend. It's just a short walk away, so I get to enjoy the convenience. The area's got a mix of apartment buildings and some pretty affordable restaurants and bars that are fun to hang out at. One of the bars just changed its name, and it's a bit pricier, but the service and drinks aren't bad. Most of the people around here are either students like me or lower-income folks, thanks to the affordable housing. There's a lot of families with kids living here because there's an elementary school nearby. To be honest, I don't really know my neighbors, and I'm not really looking to. They're always smoking pot, and the management had to put an air freshener in front of their unit, which my boyfriend and I found hilarious. It's almost like they're taunting us. The building I live in is a bit old, but the interior's been renovated. Down the street, there are some brand new apartments that look nice, but I'm not a fan. They're cheaply made, but the rent's pretty steep, which seems like a rip-off. I think it's because they're close to campus that they can get away with it. There's a super cheap eatery about a 5-minute walk from my place that serves food on paper plates and microwaves most of their meals. Across from that is a gas station that's not a great place to work. However, the city put in some money to redo the road last summer, and now we've got a nice big sidewalk, lots of greenery on the medians and sides of the road, and the area's looking a bit nicer. The apartment building I live in is surrounded by trees, but they cut a few down, so there are some stumps left. There are way more trees here than on the street down the block. Behind my apartment complex, there's a tree line and another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street, and that one's not as nice. The sidewalks are in bad shape, and most of the buildings look run down. There are a lot of trees on this street, but it's probably just to hide how bad the buildings look. Most of the crime around here has happened at an apartment complex on 43rd street, but I'm not gonna blame them entirely. There are apartments across from me with a lot of crime and a pretty transient population. Despite all that, I kinda like living here. It's affordable, and there are plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially love how the university's within walking distance, and there are two bus stops so I can easily get to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood is like a haven. It's made up of identical-looking duplexes on a cul-de-sac, but they feel like individual homes thanks to the unique way they're spaced out. Each one's painted a bright yellow with a white porch and a green metal roof. Most of us are like one big happy family, although we're not all exactly close. You'd often catch us standing at the end of our driveway some evenings, chatting away while the kids play with their toys, draw with sidewalk chalk, or fly their kites. In today's world that's all about technology and machines, it feels like we've stepped back in time. We're surrounded by vast fields, trees, and open skies with big, puffy white clouds. But, this season's been a bit of a mixed bag - we've had tornado warnings and, for the first time, the sirens actually went off last night, so we had to head for shelter. I was crouched in my bathtub, clutching my smallest dog and my purse, along with a few pillows for good measure. My bigger dog refused to join me, instead staying in the living room, barking nervously as he sensed something was off. The neighborhood was eerily quiet, except for the sound of hail pounding the ground. After the storm, the temperature dropped dramatically - we went from 92 to 75 degrees in just a few minutes. The hail melted instantly when it hit the scorching pavement. As the skies cleared, the sun came out and rain started pouring down, followed by a breathtaking double rainbow. I quickly grabbed my camera and snapped some pics to share with my friends and family on Facebook - they were just as amazed as I was. The streets stayed quiet for a bit, then people started trickling back home from wherever they'd been when the storm hit. Once again, it was business as usual - the moms and kids were back out, and the delicious smell of dinner wafted through the air. I've only recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina, and I'm loving the friendly vibe of my new neighborhood. Everyone speaks with that charming Southern accent that's so unique and endearing. Although all the houses look the same from the outside, each apartment's different on the inside - some are surprisingly tiny. It's a bit puzzling, but it doesn't take away from the charm of this place. I adore strolling through the biggest field behind my house and making my way to the pond, which is more of a scenic spot than a swimming hole. I've spotted deer, and in the mornings, you can hear the deep, melodious song of the bullfrog. It's a fantastic place to live, just a 40-minute drive from the city of Charlotte. Every morning starts with the cheerful sound of roosters crowing from the nearby farms - it's like living in a little village all its own. We even have a friendly donkey at a nearby farm that brays in the evening to let us know he's there. I feel lucky to have found this hidden gem of a neighborhood.",
            "I moved into this neighborhood on the eve of starting eighth grade, and it was a bit of a challenge to make friends initially. However, I eventually connected with a friend who lives just two houses down from me and another guy from my street. Although they no longer live here, the memories we shared remain vivid. The familiar faces from when I first moved here are still around, giving the neighborhood a sense of continuity. Our neighborhood bears a striking resemblance to a typical American suburban neighborhood - rows of two-story houses, the sound of kids playing outside on warm days, and an overall quiet atmosphere most of the week. I've never had any issues with my neighbors, and it's not unusual to be left to your own devices unless you need help. Online deliveries are also safe, with no packages ever going missing from my porch. This level of trust is rare, and I appreciate it. The park, just a minute or two away, holds a special place in my heart. I have fond memories of playing basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood. However, it's also where I experienced one of my worst moments - getting elbowed in the nose while playing football. The good memories far outweigh the bad, and whenever I visit the park now, it's to spend time with my cousin's energetic kids. They love the swings and slides, and it brings back nostalgic feelings. The neighborhood is also quite diverse, with a wide range of cuisines available within a one-mile radius. You can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants nearby, but many people now opt for food delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash. The popular fast food joints are always busy, but you can find these in most suburban neighborhoods. There are also plenty of pizza places and diverse stores, including an Indian-owned store for those craving homemade Indian food or ready-made options. Overall, I'm grateful for my neighborhood. Seeing the horror stories of other people's neighborhood experiences on social media and the news makes me appreciate mine even more.",
            "Our little neighborhood in South Carolina is a quaint town that doesn't stand out from the crowd. However, it's made a significant name for itself in the agriculture sector. The town proudly calls itself the Peach Capital of the World, a title that's showcased on its welcoming sign. The town is mostly made up of vast farmlands, with either peach trees or cattle taking over the landscape. Houses outside of the town center are spaced out, with most being two-story homes featuring metal roofs to combat the scorching summer heat or gray shingles. These homes are often located far from the main road, allowing the front fields to be used for animals and crops. The town center, on the other hand, is where you'll find a single four-way stop light and a few stores. There are three fast-food places to choose from: Hong Kong, a small family-run Chinese restaurant; Fiesta Mexican Restaurant; or Gary's, a small burger chain. We used to have a pizzeria, but it closed down not too long ago. There's a small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug, which is surprisingly famous for selling Cherry Coca-Cola. The only grocery store in town is Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, which is a bit pricey. While it's the only option, many people prefer to drive to the Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville to buy most of their groceries. The most popular store in town, however, is Dollar General, which sells a wide range of everyday items and is always bustling from opening to closing time. There's also a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who's well-respected in the community. The store has been around for a long time and even employs movers who'll deliver the furniture to your doorstep. Next to the furniture store is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels, which offers various services like daycare, boarding, grooming, and more. The doctor's and veterinary practices are located outside of the main town area, but they're small and well-equipped to take care of the town's residents. We have a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School, and once kids complete fifth grade, they have to attend middle and high school in the next town over. Although there aren't any parks in town, we're currently building a 2.5-acre recreational area to provide families with more opportunities to spend time together and attract new visitors and residents. Despite its limitations, our town is a lovely place, so small that you could drive through it without even noticing it!",
            "I remember when I first heard about my apartment complex. It was while listening to a podcast about people who went missing, which was quite surprising. Almost every apartment in the area had rent prices over a thousand dollars a month, and I had never heard about that story or any of my friends had. It might be the harsh reality of life. I've seen some friends of mine cry themselves to sleep at night, struggling to make ends meet. Despite the high costs of living, we've learned to adapt and live with less. You start to grow fond of the musty smell of second-hand toys and old, stored clothes. It's different from the smell of adulthood, which is more like dusty magazines stacked on a dusty piano. The smell seeps into the leather and remains even after you clean it. There are three thrift stores within walking distance from my place. Starting from the far end, you can visit two charity thrift stores, a library, a rare bookshop, and a curio shop. Even though the streets are bustling with cars and people, the thrift stores are surprisingly quiet. It's a great spot to spend an afternoon. Every year, the city becomes more crowded, with more cars and people swarming in. They say it's a developing city, with one of the largest e-commerce and delivery empires headquartered here, but it still shows signs of growing pains. It reminds me of New York, where everyone is focused on their goals, and no one really asks for much from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you be. It's quite different from the South, where being a bit concerned about someone means you genuinely care. Here, you can keep to yourself and the city will just move on like the waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be, with the pianist next door and the two amateur singers upstairs always adding to the atmosphere. In a way, we're not just apartment-mates, but a community of friends who come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other out. I'm lucky to live here, and I really like most of my neighbors. They treat me well, and I try to reciprocate by keeping my space clean and leaving them little gifts. It's nice to see them and I think they enjoy my company just as much as I do theirs. Despite living in a massive, impersonal modernist complex, it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally mess up my life.",
            "The place I live in is pretty much like any other cookie-cutter suburbia. The streets seem to blend together, but my neighborhood sticks out thanks to its strict homeowner's association. As you drive in, you'll see rows of tidy single-family homes that all have the same vibe. Each front yard has a nicely manicured lawn, some decorative pebbles, and a short driveway. You might even spot a small tree or two here and there. Everyone has a two-car garage, and the roads are always well-maintained, with no potholes in sight. Most houses are one-story, but you'll sometimes see two-story ones too. One thing that's a bit different is the way we get our mail. Instead of individual mailboxes in front of each house, we have a big cluster of mailboxes at the end of the street that we access with a key. There are also two larger lockers for packages, thanks to the HOA's love of uniformity. My house is situated right at the edge of the city, so our neighborhood feels like a mix of rural and suburban. We have a lot of space for everything, which is great for outdoor activities. There's a well-maintained community pool that's gated and accessible to anyone living here. We also have walking trails where you can take your dog for a walk or go for a solo evening stroll. You don't need to visit a park to get some exercise – just walk around the neighborhood and you'll get a good workout. The community is mostly made up of retirees, but we also have some middle-aged and young professionals. The area is super safe, and everyone looks out for each other. When it comes to the city, it's surprisingly big in terms of population, but it still has a small-town feel. We've got all the amenities you'd expect, from a mall to high-end grocery stores and bargain outlets. It takes me about 15 minutes to drive to anywhere significant, but once you get there, you've got a ton of stores to choose from. We've got everything from fancy organic food stores to budget-friendly outlets with minimal staff. All in all, my neighborhood is a great place to live – it's safe, well-maintained, and has plenty of nice features like pools and walking trails. Just hop in your car and you're off to any major store you want.",
            "Yesterday, I reflected on my life in this small Midwestern town. It's situated on the outskirts of a major city, with a suburban area nearby. My neighborhood is located on the east side, and it's been described as the economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are generally low here, and most homes are either rented out or owned by low-income families. However, it's not a run-down or unpleasant place. My neighbors are friendly folks who greet me warmly whenever I walk down the street. Crime rates might be slightly higher than other parts of town, but we still manage to keep it under control. There have been a few violent incidents in the past decade, including some shootings and a homicide. A family we know personally lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Luckily, we haven't been directly affected by crime, except for the occasional missing item from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. My town has been severely impacted by the opioid epidemic that's been plaguing the country. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses, and it's been a challenge for us to cope with it. However, we have a few resources available to combat this issue, such as rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those struggling with addiction. Despite the challenges, my town has its positives. The elementary school my son attends has an excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. My son has special needs, but he's never faced bullying due to the positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that organizes various events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. The school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child has to go hungry. We have a zero-tolerance policy towards anyone feeling less than due to financial constraints, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made significant improvements to the town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side, where I live, tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for my neighbors and me. Despite this, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options to meet our needs, and although our home may not be worth much, it's comfortable and suitable for us. We've lived here for over 16 years, and I couldn't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is a melting pot of cultures, nestled on a hill surrounded by historic buildings that reflect its rich heritage. My apartment, a 7-story high-rise, faces the old theater, while just a block away, an arcade bar is the hotspot for people from all walks of life on warm summer nights. During June and July weekends, you'll often spot a line of people waiting to get in. The nearby city park is a tranquil oasis, with its expansive size considering its location. Concrete walls with stairs encircle the park, providing a sense of security. During the harsh winter months, homeless individuals set up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and steps, taking advantage of the proximity to the city's only family center, where they can access basic amenities like bathing and showering facilities. What I appreciate most about my city, though, isn't its picturesque architecture or historic landmarks. It's the people themselves who make this place special. You see, Hilltop once had a notorious reputation for gang violence, with stories of federal officials and the DEA sweeping in to clean up the streets still being passed down through generations. Despite its rough reputation, the community has worked hard to keep the area clean and cared for. They take pride in their city and neighborhood, as evident in the way they look out for one another. Some say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill at night, a warning that still lingers from the past and is tainted with social conditioning. I believe this warning is a reminder of the racism and assumptions that plague our nation, even in a city that prides itself as a melting pot. I'm grateful to be part of this community, where I've experienced kindness and generosity from strangers. Walking the streets at night, I've been offered jackets, phone charges, and words of encouragement from people who have seen beyond my skin color. It's a place where I feel at home, where I'm reminded that I'm valued and beautiful, even on the darkest of nights.",
            "I reside in a small town in rural America, specifically in Michigan, where the landscape transitions seamlessly from farmland to quaint tourist towns. You won't find massive shopping malls like Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee's here. Every time I need to go somewhere, I have to hit the road. But despite this, I live in one of the most breathtaking locations in the world, surrounded by water. My town is flanked by two incredible lakes: the majestic Lake Michigan and the serene Lake Charlevoix. Every spot you visit has its own little beach, inviting you to dip your toes in the cool waters. My neighborhood perfectly encapsulates the essence of a small town. The houses are not stacked haphazardly on top of one another; instead, they're unique, older homes that have been lovingly restored or updated. Many of the houses have basements that are visible from the street, and they're often adorned with beautiful, weathered aluminum siding. The neighborhood is a kaleidoscope of colors, with houses of every hue and style that surround my home. Most of the houses have spacious yards, complete with trampolines, playsets, and sometimes even gardens and fences for pets. The overall atmosphere is quintessentially Midwestern: hardworking people, families, and a strong sense of community. On any given day, you'll see kids running freely through the streets, people walking their dogs, biking, or rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors, and it's easy to spot those who are new to the area. You'll often see someone grilling outside and waving, or a neighbor from a few blocks away walking their dog and smiling warmly. The lawns are meticulously maintained, with neatly cut grass and tidy gardens. It's not a neighborhood that's going to leave you awestruck with its grandeur, but it's a place that exudes a sense of comfort, peace, and safety. Within walking distance, you'll find the county sheriff's department, the health department, and the city recycling center, which serves the community with valuable services. The nearby baseball and softball fields are always bustling with activity, and the sound of announcers calling out player names and keeping score is a familiar soundtrack to our town. Our small town airport is also nearby, adding to the lively atmosphere. You can easily walk to the local ice cream shop or bike to the park, which is just a few blocks away. It's an ideal place to call home."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "My city is a melting pot, with a diverse range of communities living together in the same area. Residential areas seem to pop up randomly alongside shops, restaurants, and entertainment spots, creating a lively atmosphere. Everywhere you look, there are new eateries to try and stores to explore. While some of these stores are big-name brands, others are smaller, independent boutiques that line the streets and are often within walking distance from quiet neighborhoods. The place is also dotted with nearby parks, which are always bustling with families with young kids. When it comes to the people, my neighborhood is a true microcosm of the world, with a thriving LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a significant number of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union all living in the same area. If you venture a bit further out, you'll find even more diverse communities, each with their own little enclaves, such as Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia. However, these areas are only a stone's throw away, yet the traffic can be a nightmare, especially during rush hour, when a 10-mile journey can take two hours. It's not surprising that hardly anyone walks anywhere, given the sheer size of the city and the congested roads. The result is some of the worst traffic in the world, and finding parking spots can be a real challenge. Paradoxically, the city has seen a lot of construction in recent years, with new apartment buildings sprouting up left and right. While this might make it a popular destination, many residents are worried about the influx of new people and the subsequent increase in traffic. When it comes to housing, there's a wide range of options to choose from, from large apartment buildings to single-family homes, duplexes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Even within my immediate neighborhood, I've noticed a diverse range of housing options, and the people who live here are just as varied, with different ages and backgrounds. While it's not a tight-knit community like it used to be, I still have fond memories of playing with my next-door neighbor and a few other friends from the neighborhood when I was younger.",
            "My neighborhood's got character. The majority of the houses are standalone family homes, but you'll find a few that have been split into two, still connected, if that makes sense. My place has a small front yard and a driveway to the left, much like the ones surrounding it. It's like stepping back in time, a reminder of when suburban living was the quintessential American dream. Although that dream seems to be fading away, my neighborhood and many others still hold on to it, a beacon of what once was. The people here aren't as optimistic as they used to be, the upkeep's not what it used to be, but there's still a car or two in every driveway, and the youth still play like the world revolves around them. The old public school, which has been here for nearly 90 years, still stands, still symbolizing a future for the young and stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are scarce and mostly empty, but the basketball courts are always packed. The homes may look different, but they feel the same.

I guess some people think that taking medicine makes everything better, although I'm not so sure. We also have a small movie theater that screens old films at a discounted price. The youth aren't too interested, but the older folks love it as a cheap way to get out for a night, minus the kids, of course. We have an expressway running through our town, but the entrance and exit are actually in the neighboring town. There was a petition to get an exit in our town, but the youth supported it, while the older folks were against it, claiming it would ruin the town. In the end, they convinced the city council to deny the request. We're building a new high school, and we're trying to decide on a mascot for our town.

            "At first glance, it may seem unassuming, tucked away behind a strip of shops - not the kind of place you'd expect to find homes, let alone thriving communities. But venture behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk past the hotels that sit vacant most of the year, except for the occasional summer family gathering, and you'll stumble upon a hidden gem. This otherwise unassuming area is actually home to a bustling neighborhood, where apartment complexes line the streets like intricately arranged building blocks.\n\nOne of these complexes has made headlines for some unsavory dealings, but we'll leave that aside for now - appearances can be deceiving. The apartments beside it, and the ones beside those, tell a different story - one that's largely unknown to those living in the area. Across from these complexes is a community college's branch campus, a quiet cluster of buildings standing watch over the road. Students filter in, sipping coffee and yawning as they start their day at 7 am, while commuters behind them grumble at the traffic congestion.\n\nThe road intersects with another residential street, lined with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for those with broken bones. The treatment center boasts cheerful outdoor furniture and a lazily spinning ceiling fan, stirring the hot summer air. Kids run freely in the park, doing somersaults and twirling in the grass as bees lazily flit between the flowers. Retirees walk their dogs on the walking path, shooting disapproving glances at the teenagers on skateboards and nodding politely at the cluster of teenage girls gossiping by the playground.\n\nA strip mall nearby houses a sushi restaurant with affordable food, a swimming supply store, and a nail salon. You can fill up your pool and get a manicure at the same time - the perfect combination of convenience and relaxation. There's also a DIY frozen yogurt shop, where teens often grab cups of cold, dripping yogurt and toppings while they skateboard and vape, thinking they're the coolest. This neighborhood is a quintessential slice of Americana, a time capsule in the quiet south where time seems to stand still.",
            "As we drove past the endless cornfields that filled the horizon, she asked, \"Where are we?\" I knew she'd be surprised by the vast open space. She was from a town where the convenience store was just a 5-minute walk from her house, and she'd never seen so much emptiness. I shared with her what it's like growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood where I came from. The road unwinds like a ribbon through a sea of corn, accompanied by a quarry that's home to a calm lake. Just beyond it lies my home in a small development where houses stand proudly with their brick and stucco facades. Each house boasts at least half an acre of land, which we all take great pride in maintaining. Every spring, the landscape transforms with an explosion of colorful flowers and trees that change colors with each passing season. The driveways are lined with sleek Mercedes-Benz luxury cars, glistening in the sunlight after a refreshing wash. As we continue down the road, my grey stucco home comes into view, and you'll likely catch a glimpse of my friendly Korean neighbor, always tending to his lawn with a warm smile. He spends his days mowing the grass and singing over the hum of his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Everyone in the neighborhood adores him, but beneath his friendly demeanor lies a rich history - he was once a doctor and has lost some of his wit as the years have passed. He blends in with the grass and his trusty mower, a sight that brings smiles to our faces. Eventually, you'll reach my house, where geese roam freely in the side yard, chased by our energetic Terrier. Behind my home lies a tranquil stream that feeds into the quarry, accompanied by the soothing sounds of bullfrogs, the gentle flow of the stream, and the occasional \"moo\" from the nearby farms. Across the rustic wooden bridge lies an untouched haven, teeming with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was where I spent most of my childhood, creating memories with friends and siblings - building tree forts, chasing after wild animals (or at least, trying to!), and enjoying the simple joys of childhood. Our winters can be harsh, but there's nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a lush green landscape to a barren wilderness, with the once-vibrant flowers and trees standing as skeletal reminders of the changing seasons. And when snow falls, a winter wonderland appears overnight, complete with snow angels made by my little sister and snowmen that stand guard over our little domain. My sister and I may have fought often as kids, but during the winter, snowballs were our trusty companions, and our backyard transformed into an arsenal of forts and branches. In our own little world, we were carefree kids, living in a winter wonderland where nothing else mattered.",
            "To truly grasp the essence of Portland, Oregon, you need to grasp the concept of \"weird\". The unofficial town motto, scribbled on the back of a building that's a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and a little bit of a lawbreaker, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". Some see this as a nostalgic call to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's - a place that was lesser-known, more affordable, and gave rise to unique and innovative subcultures. Others see it as an invitation - come to Portland, where you'll still be called weird, but this time as a compliment. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the constant construction of condominiums for these Californians, Portland remains weird. Being weird doesn't mean we're always accepting, but it means we accept things that others wouldn't normally accept. Weird doesn't mean we're devoid of modern conveniences and modern struggles. Like everywhere else, we buy most of our goods from China. Being weird comes in a million forms, a million ways of being not normal, but Portland's got plenty of normal too. Portland has yoga, hipsters, and business professionals. Maybe being weird just means we take all this less seriously. In my neighborhood, like many Portland neighborhoods, the streets are lined with colorful houses, home gardens bursting with flowers, herbs, and vegetables, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are essentially cardboard containers or plastic bags with unwanted items, but sometimes you'll stumble upon something magical - a treasure tailored to the person wandering by. Free boxes can contain anything from clothes and books to anything else you can imagine. The thrill of strolling through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about, from my perspective, but I'm just one of the thousands of weird Portlanders. Some people I live among wouldn't dare pick through the contents of a box on the sidewalk. They'd rather attend goat yoga (yes, yoga with live goats) or a Timbers match (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things and pursue their passions, or at least dream about pursuing them, while having one too many drinks at the bar. Unfortunately, Portland also has a drug problem, which stems from underlying mental health issues, and the constant drizzle and cloudy skies might be contributing to it. The city also struggles with homelessness, and no one seems to know the solution. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, which are better than in most parts of the country, but they're still insufficient. The non-homeless population is torn between compassion and disdain. In this, we're not weird at all.",
            "The mountains stand tall and unyielding in the north, their presence a constant reminder of the passage of time as the sun rises and sets. Their solidity is unwavering, unchanging despite my preoccupation with life's everyday struggles. It's as if they silently demand my attention on the most trying days, offering me a chance to temporarily lay my anxious thoughts to rest and find solace in their unshakeable strength. My journey here started when I first began my university studies, and it was the mountains north of campus that initially drew me in. While the university itself boasts its own share of breathtaking scenery, from buildings to ponds and trees that have a piece of my heart, the mountains hold a special place. The town is lovely in its own right, with its charming cafés where I've spent countless hours fueled by coffee and cram sessions. A short walk or bus ride takes me to the downtown area, where the faded bricks of old buildings envelop me in a sense of history and antiquity. The contrast between this laid-back atmosphere and the bustling urban city nearby is a big part of what makes this town so endearing. This dichotomy of worlds existing side by side makes it easy to create lasting memories, each tied to a specific part of town. Whether it's strolling past the rusted swings in the park after a long night of studying or racing through the downtown streets to catch a movie at the cinema, every moment is a treasure. However, as with any place, there are also memories that are harder to cherish, memories that remind us of life's complexities. The ponds, in particular, can be a poignant place for reflection and introspection, especially during those late-night existential crises when the world seems overwhelming. As I wander past the pond, the park, and the quaint houses that remind me of the comforts of suburbia, I find myself drawn towards the main street. It's there, under the golden glow of the sunrise painting the sky, that I catch sight of the mountains in all their glory. Their stature and presence are a constant reminder of my own strength and perseverance, and in that moment, I am reminded of the importance of staying the course.",
            "If you're planning a trip to Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you won't have a hard time finding it - public transport is easy to access and a super popular mode of transport in New York City. Bensonhurt's a fairly urban area, so you'll still get that New York City vibe. When you're there, get ready to see loads of Asian stores around every corner. Over the years, Bensonhurt's become a hotspot for Asians, and you'll notice an Asian-owned store every few blocks as you walk around. Supermarkets and laundromats are the most popular ones - they're super convenient, with great food quality, super cheap prices, and super efficient services. Just around my place, there are four Asian supermarkets within a 2-minute walk from each other - talk about convenience! Now, don't get me wrong, Bensonhurt's not all Asian - it's super diverse, with immigrants and their American-born kids living here. Most of the big businesses in the area are Asian-owned, but you'll also find a renovated park nearby with loads of facilities - 10 basketball courts, a big field for soccer or baseball, 4 handball courts, swings, a kids' playground, and even a water fountain for the summer. Since we're in New York City, you'll see a mix of everything here - all sorts of people getting along just fine. Unlike the city's corporate buildings, Bensonhurt's mostly got co-op living and condo apartments, with a few two-family houses here and there. The people are generally nice, but be prepared for some noise pollution - you'll hear cars blasting music and speeding by, and some folks can be a bit rowdy. If you're visiting at night, just be aware of your surroundings - the area's generally safe, but you never know when you might run into someone causing trouble. I've had my share of run-ins with troublemakers in the past, so be cautious. Plus, keep an eye out for package thieves - they're a thing here. One last thing - people don't always follow the rules about cleaning up after their dogs, so be prepared to see dog waste on the streets. My biggest pet peeve? Dog waste everywhere I go - keep your shoes clean and watch where you step!",
            "Living in my area, I've come to realize that sidewalks are a rare sight. We have a really steep hill in our neighborhood, often referred to as the \"workout hill\" due to the numerous joggers who use it as part of their daily routine. With no sidewalks on my street, pedestrians are forced to walk on the road, which can be hazardous due to the potholes and uneven surface. Our road is also lined with worn-out telephone and electric wires that look like they're on their last leg. The frequent storms and heavy rainfall in our area often cause branches and debris to knock down the power lines, leading to a patchwork of repairs. The scene is dominated by tall evergreen trees, but strangely, people here tend to see them as a nuisance, cutting them down to get a clear view of the ocean. Many houses are built high up on the hill, with expansive glass windows to take in the breathtaking view of the bay. It's truly stunning during sunset, when the water below seems to glow and the sky turns a vibrant orange. However, this sight is often obstructed by the overcast skies that prevail most days, casting a haze over the scenery. As a result, moss grows abundantly on everything it can find - roofs, cars, and railings alike. I once left my car parked for a month, and when I returned, it was covered in a thick layer of moss that took three hours to remove. Our neighborhood is home to a few schools, but it's mostly populated by older folks, many of whom have retired. Dogs are a common sight, with many owners letting them roam freely in their lawns or racing them down the street. Be careful not to leave your door or window open, or you might find a curious canine sneaking in. I once found one lounging in my living room, and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits also run wild in our area, and while some are quite large, they're a nuisance to gardeners who see them digging up plants and burrowing into lawns. My cats, on the other hand, seem to enjoy the thrill of the hunt, and have managed to drive most of them out of our neighborhood. We also have a variety of birds, including small sparrows and hummingbirds, as well as the occasional hawk or eagle that swoops by until the crows chase it off. While there are no stores nearby, a short hike down to the waterfront reveals a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. The beach itself isn't impressive, but the rocks along the shore make for a fun spot to skip stones into the water. The bay is relatively narrow, and on most days, you can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist.",
            "Me and my family, my wife and two daughters, ages 11 and 14, live in a typical suburban area in a small town in Tennessee. Our street is like a main artery connecting two state highways, which means we get more traffic than we'd like, but overall it's a peaceful neighborhood. Not many people move in or out, so I'm familiar with most of the folks around here. Everyone keeps busy with yard work and daily chores. In the winters, we enjoy sledding down a hill on our side street, right at the front corner of our street where our house is located. We see everything that's going on from our house since it's a central spot on the street. When we see a strange car, we take note of it. Some neighbors go for walks or walk their dogs, while the kids ride their bikes. With us working from home, we're often around. It's just the four of us, so I'd say our neighbors are used to seeing us come and go. We like to get outside, even on rainy days. Sometimes we grill on our back deck, and the smell of barbecue is always a delight. There's always someone cutting grass around here, so we hear lawn mowers almost daily from March to October, when the grass slows down. Our neighborhood was originally wooded, so we have plenty of trees, providing shade but also a lot of leaves in the fall, which means raking and burning them every year. I love the smell of burning leaves, signaling the start of fall. Lately, we haven't been experiencing much winter, so it just feels like an extended fall. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we usually use the back door, unless someone knocks on the front door, which is rare. When I'm working on my truck or projects in the garage with the doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, things get pretty quiet around here. We get some visitors from out of town on Thanksgiving and other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas, which brings more cars around. Overall, I really like living here. If it weren't for the through street, it'd be perfect.",
            "I live in a neighborhood smack in the middle of the high desert, surrounded by dirt and nothing much else. Unless you've experienced living here, you can't really grasp the feeling of seeing brown everywhere you look. If you do come across a lawn, you know that person is shelling out a fortune on lawn care. When I first moved here in the 90s, houses were spread out, but it wasn't as crowded as it is now. There are a lot more people and new additions, making the area look more and more like a city every day. Most places are changing the same way, I guess. The people here are generally friendly, but like any city, you've got your ups and downs. I'm lucky to live in a pretty nice neighborhood surrounded by friendly old folks. The shops around here are mostly chain stores like Food for Less and Smart and Final. If you want to go organic, you'll have to travel a bit. I rarely see any Whole Foods or similar stores around. The dominant profession in our city, from what I've observed, is construction. I think it's because our city is still pretty undeveloped, leaving plenty of wide open spaces to build on. To be honest, that scares me a bit - I prefer things the way they are. I left a big city behind, and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction, that's the field where I work full-time as a drywall and T-bar installer. What I love about my home is the variety of animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, including its stark beauty. The unique high desert climate and topography create challenging ecosystems that need our protection and are home to diverse wildlife. As a resident, it's essential to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment with us, so we can coexist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted well to the local wildlife. My three kids are obsessed with lizards and desert bugs, and as I write this, they're outside trying to catch different specimens. As for attractions, we have a few. Victorville is a great place for families to experience the desert, offering a unique experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with the annual San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will add a great mix of activities and fun to your visit, showcasing the Victorville way. Head to nearby Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to cap off your visit. If you're interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem, check out the Victor Valley Museum, which features geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of Victorville's development and industry.",
            "Hmmm...when people ask me to describe my neighborhood, my answer's gonna be pretty different, I'm sure. Most others who answer this question are probably homeowners living their own lives, but I'm a bit of an exception. My neighborhood's actually the college campus I live on, and my dorm-mates are basically my community. The surrounding campus is also part of my neighborhood, but to a lesser extent. Despite being a bit unusual, my neighborhood shares some similarities with the usual ideas about neighborhoods. Like any typical neighborhood, my campus has houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's start with the 'houses' in my neighborhood. By the way, there are three types of housing here – apartments, normal houses, and dormitories. First, in the apartments, each room usually has 2-4 people, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. Each building can have about 2 floors, so that's around 20 people living in each one. Second, there are normal houses that are available for school affiliates to rent – usually 2-4 bedrooms. However, they're quite rare, as they're not the most efficient option. Lastly, there are the typical dorm rooms where hundreds of students live, usually 2 people sharing a room, except in some cases. These are the most common type of housing here. Now that we've covered housing, let's move on to the people. My school's all about diversity, and this is reflected in the neighborhood. We have people from all sorts of cultures and ages living here. The professionals usually stay in the houses, while the new students live in the dorms and the older students live in apartments. Talking about the people here is a bit hard to sum up, so let's just move on to the stores and parks. Since my school is pretty much its own neighborhood, it has plenty of stores and a single park. The stores have a mix of dining options and the school's unique clothing and grocery stores. You can pretty much find everything you need within the neighborhood. The park's a playground for all the diverse people here, kept clean and crime-free by everyone in the neighborhood.",
            "I've been living in this neighborhood for almost 10 years now, and I think it's time for me to share some of my experiences. When I first moved here from Riverdale to Stockbridge, I was really sad - I missed my old home and the people there. But my parents wanted the best for my sister and me, so we moved to a new area with better housing and a better school. It was a big change, but over time, I got used to it and made some new friends and even some enemies at school. However, I never really got to know my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis, who lived right next door. They've been like family to me, and I appreciate them a lot. I remember attending Mr. Glen's wedding, and it was an amazing experience - I even caught the little strap from Ms. Veda's leg when she threw it away! We all danced and had a great time, and I'm looking forward to having a similar celebration someday when I'm successful and can give my future wife the life she deserves. I also had a great time with Marsharii, Mr. Glen's daughter, but I haven't seen her since then. I hope she's doing well. Our neighborhood is like a maze, but now that I have a GPS, I can explore it more. I've only gone so far, and most of the time, it's been with my friends Kason and Curtis - we used to love playing video games together and just enjoying life. Sometimes, I'd go to the park and appreciate nature, which really calms me down. It gives me a sense of peace and tranquility. I'd also bring sticks from Home Depot and practice my balance, and I even bring my bokken wooden sword if I can. It's a lot of fun doing what I love. We also have a basketball and tennis court, although I haven't played in a long time - it's nice to have the option to pick it up again if I want to. My dad taught me and my best friend tennis with Mr. Graves, and we always had a great time - they worked us hard, but we always enjoyed it. There are a lot of good memories here, but these are some of the ones that stand out to me, and I think the best times are yet to come!",
            "I'm pretty lucky to be living near the college I attend. It's just a short walk away, so I get to enjoy the convenience. The area's got a mix of apartment buildings and some pretty affordable restaurants and bars that are fun to hang out at. One of the bars just changed its name, and it's a bit pricier, but the service and drinks aren't bad. Most of the people around here are either students like me or lower-income folks, thanks to the affordable housing. There's a lot of families with kids living here because there's an elementary school nearby. To be honest, I don't really know my neighbors, and I'm not really looking to. They're always smoking pot, and the management had to put an air freshener in front of their unit, which my boyfriend and I found hilarious. It's almost like they're taunting us. The building I live in is a bit old, but the interior's been renovated. Down the street, there are some brand new apartments that look nice, but I'm not a fan. They're cheaply made, but the rent's pretty steep, which seems like a rip-off. I think it's because they're close to campus that they can get away with it. There's a super cheap eatery about a 5-minute walk from my place that serves food on paper plates and microwaves most of their meals. Across from that is a gas station that's not a great place to work. However, the city put in some money to redo the road last summer, and now we've got a nice big sidewalk, lots of greenery on the medians and sides of the road, and the area's looking a bit nicer. The apartment building I live in is surrounded by trees, but they cut a few down, so there are some stumps left. There are way more trees here than on the street down the block. Behind my apartment complex, there's a tree line and another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street, and that one's not as nice. The sidewalks are in bad shape, and most of the buildings look run down. There are a lot of trees on this street, but it's probably just to hide how bad the buildings look. Most of the crime around here has happened at an apartment complex on 43rd street, but I'm not gonna blame them entirely. There are apartments across from me with a lot of crime and a pretty transient population. Despite all that, I kinda like living here. It's affordable, and there are plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially love how the university's within walking distance, and there are two bus stops so I can easily get to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood is like a haven. It's made up of identical-looking duplexes on a cul-de-sac, but they feel like individual homes thanks to the unique way they're spaced out. Each one's painted a bright yellow with a white porch and a green metal roof. Most of us are like one big happy family, although we're not all exactly close. You'd often catch us standing at the end of our driveway some evenings, chatting away while the kids play with their toys, draw with sidewalk chalk, or fly their kites. In today's world that's all about technology and machines, it feels like we've stepped back in time. We're surrounded by vast fields, trees, and open skies with big, puffy white clouds. But, this season's been a bit of a mixed bag - we've had tornado warnings and, for the first time, the sirens actually went off last night, so we had to head for shelter. I was crouched in my bathtub, clutching my smallest dog and my purse, along with a few pillows for good measure. My bigger dog refused to join me, instead staying in the living room, barking nervously as he sensed something was off. The neighborhood was eerily quiet, except for the sound of hail pounding the ground. After the storm, the temperature dropped dramatically - we went from 92 to 75 degrees in just a few minutes. The hail melted instantly when it hit the scorching pavement. As the skies cleared, the sun came out and rain started pouring down, followed by a breathtaking double rainbow. I quickly grabbed my camera and snapped some pics to share with my friends and family on Facebook - they were just as amazed as I was. The streets stayed quiet for a bit, then people started trickling back home from wherever they'd been when the storm hit. Once again, it was business as usual - the moms and kids were back out, and the delicious smell of dinner wafted through the air. I've only recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina, and I'm loving the friendly vibe of my new neighborhood. Everyone speaks with that charming Southern accent that's so unique and endearing. Although all the houses look the same from the outside, each apartment's different on the inside - some are surprisingly tiny. It's a bit puzzling, but it doesn't take away from the charm of this place. I adore strolling through the biggest field behind my house and making my way to the pond, which is more of a scenic spot than a swimming hole. I've spotted deer, and in the mornings, you can hear the deep, melodious song of the bullfrog. It's a fantastic place to live, just a 40-minute drive from the city of Charlotte. Every morning starts with the cheerful sound of roosters crowing from the nearby farms - it's like living in a little village all its own. We even have a friendly donkey at a nearby farm that brays in the evening to let us know he's there. I feel lucky to have found this hidden gem of a neighborhood.",
            "I moved into this neighborhood on the eve of starting eighth grade, and it was a bit of a challenge to make friends initially. However, I eventually connected with a friend who lives just two houses down from me and another guy from my street. Although they no longer live here, the memories we shared remain vivid. The familiar faces from when I first moved here are still around, giving the neighborhood a sense of continuity. Our neighborhood bears a striking resemblance to a typical American suburban neighborhood - rows of two-story houses, the sound of kids playing outside on warm days, and an overall quiet atmosphere most of the week. I've never had any issues with my neighbors, and it's not unusual to be left to your own devices unless you need help. Online deliveries are also safe, with no packages ever going missing from my porch. This level of trust is rare, and I appreciate it. The park, just a minute or two away, holds a special place in my heart. I have fond memories of playing basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood. However, it's also where I experienced one of my worst moments - getting elbowed in the nose while playing football. The good memories far outweigh the bad, and whenever I visit the park now, it's to spend time with my cousin's energetic kids. They love the swings and slides, and it brings back nostalgic feelings. The neighborhood is also quite diverse, with a wide range of cuisines available within a one-mile radius. You can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants nearby, but many people now opt for food delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash. The popular fast food joints are always busy, but you can find these in most suburban neighborhoods. There are also plenty of pizza places and diverse stores, including an Indian-owned store for those craving homemade Indian food or ready-made options. Overall, I'm grateful for my neighborhood. Seeing the horror stories of other people's neighborhood experiences on social media and the news makes me appreciate mine even more.",
            "Our little neighborhood in South Carolina is a quaint town that doesn't stand out from the crowd. However, it's made a significant name for itself in the agriculture sector. The town proudly calls itself the Peach Capital of the World, a title that's showcased on its welcoming sign. The town is mostly made up of vast farmlands, with either peach trees or cattle taking over the landscape. Houses outside of the town center are spaced out, with most being two-story homes featuring metal roofs to combat the scorching summer heat or gray shingles. These homes are often located far from the main road, allowing the front fields to be used for animals and crops. The town center, on the other hand, is where you'll find a single four-way stop light and a few stores. There are three fast-food places to choose from: Hong Kong, a small family-run Chinese restaurant; Fiesta Mexican Restaurant; or Gary's, a small burger chain. We used to have a pizzeria, but it closed down not too long ago. There's a small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug, which is surprisingly famous for selling Cherry Coca-Cola. The only grocery store in town is Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, which is a bit pricey. While it's the only option, many people prefer to drive to the Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville to buy most of their groceries. The most popular store in town, however, is Dollar General, which sells a wide range of everyday items and is always bustling from opening to closing time. There's also a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who's well-respected in the community. The store has been around for a long time and even employs movers who'll deliver the furniture to your doorstep. Next to the furniture store is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels, which offers various services like daycare, boarding, grooming, and more. The doctor's and veterinary practices are located outside of the main town area, but they're small and well-equipped to take care of the town's residents. We have a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School, and once kids complete fifth grade, they have to attend middle and high school in the next town over. Although there aren't any parks in town, we're currently building a 2.5-acre recreational area to provide families with more opportunities to spend time together and attract new visitors and residents. Despite its limitations, our town is a lovely place, so small that you could drive through it without even noticing it!",
            "I remember when I first heard about my apartment complex. It was while listening to a podcast about people who went missing, which was quite surprising. Almost every apartment in the area had rent prices over a thousand dollars a month, and I had never heard about that story or any of my friends had. It might be the harsh reality of life. I've seen some friends of mine cry themselves to sleep at night, struggling to make ends meet. Despite the high costs of living, we've learned to adapt and live with less. You start to grow fond of the musty smell of second-hand toys and old, stored clothes. It's different from the smell of adulthood, which is more like dusty magazines stacked on a dusty piano. The smell seeps into the leather and remains even after you clean it. There are three thrift stores within walking distance from my place. Starting from the far end, you can visit two charity thrift stores, a library, a rare bookshop, and a curio shop. Even though the streets are bustling with cars and people, the thrift stores are surprisingly quiet. It's a great spot to spend an afternoon. Every year, the city becomes more crowded, with more cars and people swarming in. They say it's a developing city, with one of the largest e-commerce and delivery empires headquartered here, but it still shows signs of growing pains. It reminds me of New York, where everyone is focused on their goals, and no one really asks for much from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you be. It's quite different from the South, where being a bit concerned about someone means you genuinely care. Here, you can keep to yourself and the city will just move on like the waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be, with the pianist next door and the two amateur singers upstairs always adding to the atmosphere. In a way, we're not just apartment-mates, but a community of friends who come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other out. I'm lucky to live here, and I really like most of my neighbors. They treat me well, and I try to reciprocate by keeping my space clean and leaving them little gifts. It's nice to see them and I think they enjoy my company just as much as I do theirs. Despite living in a massive, impersonal modernist complex, it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally mess up my life.",
            "The place I live in is pretty much like any other cookie-cutter suburbia. The streets seem to blend together, but my neighborhood sticks out thanks to its strict homeowner's association. As you drive in, you'll see rows of tidy single-family homes that all have the same vibe. Each front yard has a nicely manicured lawn, some decorative pebbles, and a short driveway. You might even spot a small tree or two here and there. Everyone has a two-car garage, and the roads are always well-maintained, with no potholes in sight. Most houses are one-story, but you'll sometimes see two-story ones too. One thing that's a bit different is the way we get our mail. Instead of individual mailboxes in front of each house, we have a big cluster of mailboxes at the end of the street that we access with a key. There are also two larger lockers for packages, thanks to the HOA's love of uniformity. My house is situated right at the edge of the city, so our neighborhood feels like a mix of rural and suburban. We have a lot of space for everything, which is great for outdoor activities. There's a well-maintained community pool that's gated and accessible to anyone living here. We also have walking trails where you can take your dog for a walk or go for a solo evening stroll. You don't need to visit a park to get some exercise – just walk around the neighborhood and you'll get a good workout. The community is mostly made up of retirees, but we also have some middle-aged and young professionals. The area is super safe, and everyone looks out for each other. When it comes to the city, it's surprisingly big in terms of population, but it still has a small-town feel. We've got all the amenities you'd expect, from a mall to high-end grocery stores and bargain outlets. It takes me about 15 minutes to drive to anywhere significant, but once you get there, you've got a ton of stores to choose from. We've got everything from fancy organic food stores to budget-friendly outlets with minimal staff. All in all, my neighborhood is a great place to live – it's safe, well-maintained, and has plenty of nice features like pools and walking trails. Just hop in your car and you're off to any major store you want.",
            "Yesterday, I reflected on my life in this small Midwestern town. It's situated on the outskirts of a major city, with a suburban area nearby. My neighborhood is located on the east side, and it's been described as the economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are generally low here, and most homes are either rented out or owned by low-income families. However, it's not a run-down or unpleasant place. My neighbors are friendly folks who greet me warmly whenever I walk down the street. Crime rates might be slightly higher than other parts of town, but we still manage to keep it under control. There have been a few violent incidents in the past decade, including some shootings and a homicide. A family we know personally lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Luckily, we haven't been directly affected by crime, except for the occasional missing item from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. My town has been severely impacted by the opioid epidemic that's been plaguing the country. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses, and it's been a challenge for us to cope with it. However, we have a few resources available to combat this issue, such as rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those struggling with addiction. Despite the challenges, my town has its positives. The elementary school my son attends has an excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. My son has special needs, but he's never faced bullying due to the positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that organizes various events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. The school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child has to go hungry. We have a zero-tolerance policy towards anyone feeling less than due to financial constraints, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made significant improvements to the town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side, where I live, tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for my neighbors and me. Despite this, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options to meet our needs, and although our home may not be worth much, it's comfortable and suitable for us. We've lived here for over 16 years, and I couldn't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is a melting pot of cultures, nestled on a hill surrounded by historic buildings that reflect its rich heritage. My apartment, a 7-story high-rise, faces the old theater, while just a block away, an arcade bar is the hotspot for people from all walks of life on warm summer nights. During June and July weekends, you'll often spot a line of people waiting to get in. The nearby city park is a tranquil oasis, with its expansive size considering its location. Concrete walls with stairs encircle the park, providing a sense of security. During the harsh winter months, homeless individuals set up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and steps, taking advantage of the proximity to the city's only family center, where they can access basic amenities like bathing and showering facilities. What I appreciate most about my city, though, isn't its picturesque architecture or historic landmarks. It's the people themselves who make this place special. You see, Hilltop once had a notorious reputation for gang violence, with stories of federal officials and the DEA sweeping in to clean up the streets still being passed down through generations. Despite its rough reputation, the community has worked hard to keep the area clean and cared for. They take pride in their city and neighborhood, as evident in the way they look out for one another. Some say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill at night, a warning that still lingers from the past and is tainted with social conditioning. I believe this warning is a reminder of the racism and assumptions that plague our nation, even in a city that prides itself as a melting pot. I'm grateful to be part of this community, where I've experienced kindness and generosity from strangers. Walking the streets at night, I've been offered jackets, phone charges, and words of encouragement from people who have seen beyond my skin color. It's a place where I feel at home, where I'm reminded that I'm valued and beautiful, even on the darkest of nights.",
            "I reside in a small town in rural America, specifically in Michigan, where the landscape transitions seamlessly from farmland to quaint tourist towns. You won't find massive shopping malls like Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee's here. Every time I need to go somewhere, I have to hit the road. But despite this, I live in one of the most breathtaking locations in the world, surrounded by water. My town is flanked by two incredible lakes: the majestic Lake Michigan and the serene Lake Charlevoix. Every spot you visit has its own little beach, inviting you to dip your toes in the cool waters. My neighborhood perfectly encapsulates the essence of a small town. The houses are not stacked haphazardly on top of one another; instead, they're unique, older homes that have been lovingly restored or updated. Many of the houses have basements that are visible from the street, and they're often adorned with beautiful, weathered aluminum siding. The neighborhood is a kaleidoscope of colors, with houses of every hue and style that surround my home. Most of the houses have spacious yards, complete with trampolines, playsets, and sometimes even gardens and fences for pets. The overall atmosphere is quintessentially Midwestern: hardworking people, families, and a strong sense of community. On any given day, you'll see kids running freely through the streets, people walking their dogs, biking, or rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors, and it's easy to spot those who are new to the area. You'll often see someone grilling outside and waving, or a neighbor from a few blocks away walking their dog and smiling warmly. The lawns are meticulously maintained, with neatly cut grass and tidy gardens. It's not a neighborhood that's going to leave you awestruck with its grandeur, but it's a place that exudes a sense of comfort, peace, and safety. Within walking distance, you'll find the county sheriff's department, the health department, and the city recycling center, which serves the community with valuable services. The nearby baseball and softball fields are always bustling with activity, and the sound of announcers calling out player names and keeping score is a familiar soundtrack to our town. Our small town airport is also nearby, adding to the lively atmosphere. You can easily walk to the local ice cream shop or bike to the park, which is just a few blocks away. It's an ideal place to call home."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "My city is a melting pot, with a diverse range of communities living together in the same area. Residential areas seem to pop up randomly alongside shops, restaurants, and entertainment spots, creating a lively atmosphere. Everywhere you look, there are new eateries to try and stores to explore. While some of these stores are big-name brands, others are smaller, independent boutiques that line the streets and are often within walking distance from quiet neighborhoods. The place is also dotted with nearby parks, which are always bustling with families with young kids. When it comes to the people, my neighborhood is a true microcosm of the world, with a thriving LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a significant number of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union all living in the same area. If you venture a bit further out, you'll find even more diverse communities, each with their own little enclaves, such as Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia. However, these areas are only a stone's throw away, yet the traffic can be a nightmare, especially during rush hour, when a 10-mile journey can take two hours. It's not surprising that hardly anyone walks anywhere, given the sheer size of the city and the congested roads. The result is some of the worst traffic in the world, and finding parking spots can be a real challenge. Paradoxically, the city has seen a lot of construction in recent years, with new apartment buildings sprouting up left and right. While this might make it a popular destination, many residents are worried about the influx of new people and the subsequent increase in traffic. When it comes to housing, there's a wide range of options to choose from, from large apartment buildings to single-family homes, duplexes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Even within my immediate neighborhood, I've noticed a diverse range of housing options, and the people who live here are just as varied, with different ages and backgrounds.

            "At first glance, it may seem unassuming, tucked away behind a strip of shops - not the kind of place you'd expect to find homes, let alone thriving communities. But venture behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk past the hotels that sit vacant most of the year, except for the occasional summer family gathering, and you'll stumble upon a hidden gem. This otherwise unassuming area is actually home to a bustling neighborhood, where apartment complexes line the streets like intricately arranged building blocks.\n\nOne of these complexes has made headlines for some unsavory dealings, but we'll leave that aside for now - appearances can be deceiving.

            "As we drove past the endless cornfields that filled the horizon, she asked, \"Where are we?\" I knew she'd be surprised by the vast open space. She was from a town where the convenience store was just a 5-minute walk from her house, and she'd never seen so much emptiness. I shared with her what it's like growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood where I came from. The road unwinds like a ribbon through a sea of corn, accompanied by a quarry that's home to a calm lake. Just beyond it lies my home in a small development where houses stand proudly with their brick and stucco facades. Each house boasts at least half an acre of land, which we all take great pride in maintaining. Every spring, the landscape transforms with an explosion of colorful flowers and trees that change colors with each passing season. The driveways are lined with sleek Mercedes-Benz luxury cars, glistening in the sunlight after a refreshing wash. As we continue down the road, my grey stucco home comes into view, and you'll likely catch a glimpse of my friendly Korean neighbor, always tending to his lawn with a warm smile. He spends his days mowing the grass and singing over the hum of his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Everyone in the neighborhood adores him, but beneath his friendly demeanor lies a rich history - he was once a doctor and has lost some of his wit as the years have passed. He blends in with the grass and his trusty mower, a sight that brings smiles to our faces. Eventually, you'll reach my house, where geese roam freely in the side yard, chased by our energetic Terrier. Behind my home lies a tranquil stream that feeds into the quarry, accompanied by the soothing sounds of bullfrogs, the gentle flow of the stream, and the occasional \"moo\" from the nearby farms. Across the rustic wooden bridge lies an untouched haven, teeming with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was where I spent most of my childhood, creating memories with friends and siblings - building tree forts, chasing after wild animals (or at least, trying to!), and enjoying the simple joys of childhood. Our winters can be harsh, but there's nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a lush green landscape to a barren wilderness, with the once-vibrant flowers and trees standing as skeletal reminders of the changing seasons. And when snow falls, a winter wonderland appears overnight, complete with snow angels made by my little sister and snowmen that stand guard over our little domain. My sister and I may have fought often as kids, but during the winter, snowballs were our trusty companions, and our backyard transformed into an arsenal of forts and branches. In our own little world, we were carefree kids, living in a winter wonderland where nothing else mattered.",
            "To truly grasp the essence of Portland, Oregon, you need to grasp the concept of \"weird\". The unofficial town motto, scribbled on the back of a building that's a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and a little bit of a lawbreaker, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". Some see this as a nostalgic call to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's - a place that was lesser-known, more affordable, and gave rise to unique and innovative subcultures. Others see it as an invitation - come to Portland, where you'll still be called weird, but this time as a compliment. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the constant construction of condominiums for these Californians, Portland remains weird. Being weird doesn't mean we're always accepting, but it means we accept things that others wouldn't normally accept. Weird doesn't mean we're devoid of modern conveniences and modern struggles. Like everywhere else, we buy most of our goods from China. Being weird comes in a million forms, a million ways of being not normal, but Portland's got plenty of normal too. Portland has yoga, hipsters, and business professionals. Maybe being weird just means we take all this less seriously. In my neighborhood, like many Portland neighborhoods, the streets are lined with colorful houses, home gardens bursting with flowers, herbs, and vegetables, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are essentially cardboard containers or plastic bags with unwanted items, but sometimes you'll stumble upon something magical - a treasure tailored to the person wandering by. Free boxes can contain anything from clothes and books to anything else you can imagine. The thrill of strolling through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about, from my perspective, but I'm just one of the thousands of weird Portlanders. Some people I live among wouldn't dare pick through the contents of a box on the sidewalk. They'd rather attend goat yoga (yes, yoga with live goats) or a Timbers match (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things and pursue their passions, or at least dream about pursuing them, while having one too many drinks at the bar. Unfortunately, Portland also has a drug problem, which stems from underlying mental health issues, and the constant drizzle and cloudy skies might be contributing to it. The city also struggles with homelessness, and no one seems to know the solution. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, which are better than in most parts of the country, but they're still insufficient. The non-homeless population is torn between compassion and disdain. In this, we're not weird at all.",
            "The mountains stand tall and unyielding in the north, their presence a constant reminder of the passage of time as the sun rises and sets. Their solidity is unwavering, unchanging despite my preoccupation with life's everyday struggles. It's as if they silently demand my attention on the most trying days, offering me a chance to temporarily lay my anxious thoughts to rest and find solace in their unshakeable strength. My journey here started when I first began my university studies, and it was the mountains north of campus that initially drew me in. While the university itself boasts its own share of breathtaking scenery, from buildings to ponds and trees that have a piece of my heart, the mountains hold a special place. The town is lovely in its own right, with its charming cafés where I've spent countless hours fueled by coffee and cram sessions. A short walk or bus ride takes me to the downtown area, where the faded bricks of old buildings envelop me in a sense of history and antiquity. The contrast between this laid-back atmosphere and the bustling urban city nearby is a big part of what makes this town so endearing. This dichotomy of worlds existing side by side makes it easy to create lasting memories, each tied to a specific part of town. Whether it's strolling past the rusted swings in the park after a long night of studying or racing through the downtown streets to catch a movie at the cinema, every moment is a treasure. However, as with any place, there are also memories that are harder to cherish, memories that remind us of life's complexities. The ponds, in particular, can be a poignant place for reflection and introspection, especially during those late-night existential crises when the world seems overwhelming. As I wander past the pond, the park, and the quaint houses that remind me of the comforts of suburbia, I find myself drawn towards the main street. It's there, under the golden glow of the sunrise painting the sky, that I catch sight of the mountains in all their glory. Their stature and presence are a constant reminder of my own strength and perseverance, and in that moment, I am reminded of the importance of staying the course.",
            "If you're planning a trip to Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you won't have a hard time finding it - public transport is easy to access and a super popular mode of transport in New York City. Bensonhurt's a fairly urban area, so you'll still get that New York City vibe. When you're there, get ready to see loads of Asian stores around every corner. Over the years, Bensonhurt's become a hotspot for Asians, and you'll notice an Asian-owned store every few blocks as you walk around. Supermarkets and laundromats are the most popular ones - they're super convenient, with great food quality, super cheap prices, and super efficient services. Just around my place, there are four Asian supermarkets within a 2-minute walk from each other - talk about convenience! Now, don't get me wrong, Bensonhurt's not all Asian - it's super diverse, with immigrants and their American-born kids living here. Most of the big businesses in the area are Asian-owned, but you'll also find a renovated park nearby with loads of facilities - 10 basketball courts, a big field for soccer or baseball, 4 handball courts, swings, a kids' playground, and even a water fountain for the summer. Since we're in New York City, you'll see a mix of everything here - all sorts of people getting along just fine. Unlike the city's corporate buildings, Bensonhurt's mostly got co-op living and condo apartments, with a few two-family houses here and there. The people are generally nice, but be prepared for some noise pollution - you'll hear cars blasting music and speeding by, and some folks can be a bit rowdy. If you're visiting at night, just be aware of your surroundings - the area's generally safe, but you never know when you might run into someone causing trouble. I've had my share of run-ins with troublemakers in the past, so be cautious. Plus, keep an eye out for package thieves - they're a thing here. One last thing - people don't always follow the rules about cleaning up after their dogs, so be prepared to see dog waste on the streets. My biggest pet peeve? Dog waste everywhere I go - keep your shoes clean and watch where you step!",
            "Living in my area, I've come to realize that sidewalks are a rare sight. We have a really steep hill in our neighborhood, often referred to as the \"workout hill\" due to the numerous joggers who use it as part of their daily routine. With no sidewalks on my street, pedestrians are forced to walk on the road, which can be hazardous due to the potholes and uneven surface. Our road is also lined with worn-out telephone and electric wires that look like they're on their last leg. The frequent storms and heavy rainfall in our area often cause branches and debris to knock down the power lines, leading to a patchwork of repairs. The scene is dominated by tall evergreen trees, but strangely, people here tend to see them as a nuisance, cutting them down to get a clear view of the ocean. Many houses are built high up on the hill, with expansive glass windows to take in the breathtaking view of the bay. It's truly stunning during sunset, when the water below seems to glow and the sky turns a vibrant orange. However, this sight is often obstructed by the overcast skies that prevail most days, casting a haze over the scenery. As a result, moss grows abundantly on everything it can find - roofs, cars, and railings alike. I once left my car parked for a month, and when I returned, it was covered in a thick layer of moss that took three hours to remove. Our neighborhood is home to a few schools, but it's mostly populated by older folks, many of whom have retired. Dogs are a common sight, with many owners letting them roam freely in their lawns or racing them down the street. Be careful not to leave your door or window open, or you might find a curious canine sneaking in. I once found one lounging in my living room, and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits also run wild in our area, and while some are quite large, they're a nuisance to gardeners who see them digging up plants and burrowing into lawns. My cats, on the other hand, seem to enjoy the thrill of the hunt, and have managed to drive most of them out of our neighborhood. We also have a variety of birds, including small sparrows and hummingbirds, as well as the occasional hawk or eagle that swoops by until the crows chase it off. While there are no stores nearby, a short hike down to the waterfront reveals a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. The beach itself isn't impressive, but the rocks along the shore make for a fun spot to skip stones into the water. The bay is relatively narrow, and on most days, you can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist.",
            "Me and my family, my wife and two daughters, ages 11 and 14, live in a typical suburban area in a small town in Tennessee. Our street is like a main artery connecting two state highways, which means we get more traffic than we'd like, but overall it's a peaceful neighborhood. Not many people move in or out, so I'm familiar with most of the folks around here. Everyone keeps busy with yard work and daily chores. In the winters, we enjoy sledding down a hill on our side street, right at the front corner of our street where our house is located. We see everything that's going on from our house since it's a central spot on the street. When we see a strange car, we take note of it. Some neighbors go for walks or walk their dogs, while the kids ride their bikes. With us working from home, we're often around. It's just the four of us, so I'd say our neighbors are used to seeing us come and go. We like to get outside, even on rainy days. Sometimes we grill on our back deck, and the smell of barbecue is always a delight. There's always someone cutting grass around here, so we hear lawn mowers almost daily from March to October, when the grass slows down. Our neighborhood was originally wooded, so we have plenty of trees, providing shade but also a lot of leaves in the fall, which means raking and burning them every year. I love the smell of burning leaves, signaling the start of fall. Lately, we haven't been experiencing much winter, so it just feels like an extended fall. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we usually use the back door, unless someone knocks on the front door, which is rare. When I'm working on my truck or projects in the garage with the doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, things get pretty quiet around here. We get some visitors from out of town on Thanksgiving and other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas, which brings more cars around. Overall, I really like living here. If it weren't for the through street, it'd be perfect.",
            "I live in a neighborhood smack in the middle of the high desert, surrounded by dirt and nothing much else. Unless you've experienced living here, you can't really grasp the feeling of seeing brown everywhere you look. If you do come across a lawn, you know that person is shelling out a fortune on lawn care. When I first moved here in the 90s, houses were spread out, but it wasn't as crowded as it is now. There are a lot more people and new additions, making the area look more and more like a city every day. Most places are changing the same way, I guess. The people here are generally friendly, but like any city, you've got your ups and downs. I'm lucky to live in a pretty nice neighborhood surrounded by friendly old folks. The shops around here are mostly chain stores like Food for Less and Smart and Final. If you want to go organic, you'll have to travel a bit. I rarely see any Whole Foods or similar stores around. The dominant profession in our city, from what I've observed, is construction. I think it's because our city is still pretty undeveloped, leaving plenty of wide open spaces to build on. To be honest, that scares me a bit - I prefer things the way they are. I left a big city behind, and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction, that's the field where I work full-time as a drywall and T-bar installer. What I love about my home is the variety of animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, including its stark beauty. The unique high desert climate and topography create challenging ecosystems that need our protection and are home to diverse wildlife. As a resident, it's essential to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment with us, so we can coexist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted well to the local wildlife. My three kids are obsessed with lizards and desert bugs, and as I write this, they're outside trying to catch different specimens. As for attractions, we have a few. Victorville is a great place for families to experience the desert, offering a unique experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with the annual San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will add a great mix of activities and fun to your visit, showcasing the Victorville way. Head to nearby Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to cap off your visit. If you're interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem, check out the Victor Valley Museum, which features geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of Victorville's development and industry.",
            "Hmmm...when people ask me to describe my neighborhood, my answer's gonna be pretty different, I'm sure. Most others who answer this question are probably homeowners living their own lives, but I'm a bit of an exception. My neighborhood's actually the college campus I live on, and my dorm-mates are basically my community. The surrounding campus is also part of my neighborhood, but to a lesser extent. Despite being a bit unusual, my neighborhood shares some similarities with the usual ideas about neighborhoods. Like any typical neighborhood, my campus has houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's start with the 'houses' in my neighborhood. By the way, there are three types of housing here – apartments, normal houses, and dormitories. First, in the apartments, each room usually has 2-4 people, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. Each building can have about 2 floors, so that's around 20 people living in each one. Second, there are normal houses that are available for school affiliates to rent – usually 2-4 bedrooms. However, they're quite rare, as they're not the most efficient option. Lastly, there are the typical dorm rooms where hundreds of students live, usually 2 people sharing a room, except in some cases. These are the most common type of housing here. Now that we've covered housing, let's move on to the people. My school's all about diversity, and this is reflected in the neighborhood. We have people from all sorts of cultures and ages living here. The professionals usually stay in the houses, while the new students live in the dorms and the older students live in apartments. Talking about the people here is a bit hard to sum up, so let's just move on to the stores and parks. Since my school is pretty much its own neighborhood, it has plenty of stores and a single park. The stores have a mix of dining options and the school's unique clothing and grocery stores. You can pretty much find everything you need within the neighborhood. The park's a playground for all the diverse people here, kept clean and crime-free by everyone in the neighborhood.",
            "I've been living in this neighborhood for almost 10 years now, and I think it's time for me to share some of my experiences. When I first moved here from Riverdale to Stockbridge, I was really sad - I missed my old home and the people there. But my parents wanted the best for my sister and me, so we moved to a new area with better housing and a better school. It was a big change, but over time, I got used to it and made some new friends and even some enemies at school. However, I never really got to know my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis, who lived right next door. They've been like family to me, and I appreciate them a lot. I remember attending Mr. Glen's wedding, and it was an amazing experience - I even caught the little strap from Ms. Veda's leg when she threw it away! We all danced and had a great time, and I'm looking forward to having a similar celebration someday when I'm successful and can give my future wife the life she deserves. I also had a great time with Marsharii, Mr. Glen's daughter, but I haven't seen her since then. I hope she's doing well. Our neighborhood is like a maze, but now that I have a GPS, I can explore it more. I've only gone so far, and most of the time, it's been with my friends Kason and Curtis - we used to love playing video games together and just enjoying life. Sometimes, I'd go to the park and appreciate nature, which really calms me down. It gives me a sense of peace and tranquility. I'd also bring sticks from Home Depot and practice my balance, and I even bring my bokken wooden sword if I can. It's a lot of fun doing what I love. We also have a basketball and tennis court, although I haven't played in a long time - it's nice to have the option to pick it up again if I want to. My dad taught me and my best friend tennis with Mr. Graves, and we always had a great time - they worked us hard, but we always enjoyed it. There are a lot of good memories here, but these are some of the ones that stand out to me, and I think the best times are yet to come!",
            "I'm pretty lucky to be living near the college I attend. It's just a short walk away, so I get to enjoy the convenience. The area's got a mix of apartment buildings and some pretty affordable restaurants and bars that are fun to hang out at. One of the bars just changed its name, and it's a bit pricier, but the service and drinks aren't bad. Most of the people around here are either students like me or lower-income folks, thanks to the affordable housing. There's a lot of families with kids living here because there's an elementary school nearby. To be honest, I don't really know my neighbors, and I'm not really looking to. They're always smoking pot, and the management had to put an air freshener in front of their unit, which my boyfriend and I found hilarious. It's almost like they're taunting us. The building I live in is a bit old, but the interior's been renovated. Down the street, there are some brand new apartments that look nice, but I'm not a fan. They're cheaply made, but the rent's pretty steep, which seems like a rip-off. I think it's because they're close to campus that they can get away with it. There's a super cheap eatery about a 5-minute walk from my place that serves food on paper plates and microwaves most of their meals. Across from that is a gas station that's not a great place to work. However, the city put in some money to redo the road last summer, and now we've got a nice big sidewalk, lots of greenery on the medians and sides of the road, and the area's looking a bit nicer. The apartment building I live in is surrounded by trees, but they cut a few down, so there are some stumps left. There are way more trees here than on the street down the block. Behind my apartment complex, there's a tree line and another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street, and that one's not as nice. The sidewalks are in bad shape, and most of the buildings look run down. There are a lot of trees on this street, but it's probably just to hide how bad the buildings look. Most of the crime around here has happened at an apartment complex on 43rd street, but I'm not gonna blame them entirely. There are apartments across from me with a lot of crime and a pretty transient population. Despite all that, I kinda like living here. It's affordable, and there are plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially love how the university's within walking distance, and there are two bus stops so I can easily get to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood is like a haven. It's made up of identical-looking duplexes on a cul-de-sac, but they feel like individual homes thanks to the unique way they're spaced out. Each one's painted a bright yellow with a white porch and a green metal roof. Most of us are like one big happy family, although we're not all exactly close. You'd often catch us standing at the end of our driveway some evenings, chatting away while the kids play with their toys, draw with sidewalk chalk, or fly their kites. In today's world that's all about technology and machines, it feels like we've stepped back in time. We're surrounded by vast fields, trees, and open skies with big, puffy white clouds. But, this season's been a bit of a mixed bag - we've had tornado warnings and, for the first time, the sirens actually went off last night, so we had to head for shelter. I was crouched in my bathtub, clutching my smallest dog and my purse, along with a few pillows for good measure. My bigger dog refused to join me, instead staying in the living room, barking nervously as he sensed something was off. The neighborhood was eerily quiet, except for the sound of hail pounding the ground. After the storm, the temperature dropped dramatically - we went from 92 to 75 degrees in just a few minutes. The hail melted instantly when it hit the scorching pavement. As the skies cleared, the sun came out and rain started pouring down, followed by a breathtaking double rainbow. I quickly grabbed my camera and snapped some pics to share with my friends and family on Facebook - they were just as amazed as I was. The streets stayed quiet for a bit, then people started trickling back home from wherever they'd been when the storm hit. Once again, it was business as usual - the moms and kids were back out, and the delicious smell of dinner wafted through the air. I've only recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina, and I'm loving the friendly vibe of my new neighborhood. Everyone speaks with that charming Southern accent that's so unique and endearing. Although all the houses look the same from the outside, each apartment's different on the inside - some are surprisingly tiny. It's a bit puzzling, but it doesn't take away from the charm of this place. I adore strolling through the biggest field behind my house and making my way to the pond, which is more of a scenic spot than a swimming hole. I've spotted deer, and in the mornings, you can hear the deep, melodious song of the bullfrog. It's a fantastic place to live, just a 40-minute drive from the city of Charlotte. Every morning starts with the cheerful sound of roosters crowing from the nearby farms - it's like living in a little village all its own. We even have a friendly donkey at a nearby farm that brays in the evening to let us know he's there. I feel lucky to have found this hidden gem of a neighborhood.",
            "I moved into this neighborhood on the eve of starting eighth grade, and it was a bit of a challenge to make friends initially. However, I eventually connected with a friend who lives just two houses down from me and another guy from my street. Although they no longer live here, the memories we shared remain vivid. The familiar faces from when I first moved here are still around, giving the neighborhood a sense of continuity. Our neighborhood bears a striking resemblance to a typical American suburban neighborhood - rows of two-story houses, the sound of kids playing outside on warm days, and an overall quiet atmosphere most of the week. I've never had any issues with my neighbors, and it's not unusual to be left to your own devices unless you need help. Online deliveries are also safe, with no packages ever going missing from my porch. This level of trust is rare, and I appreciate it. The park, just a minute or two away, holds a special place in my heart. I have fond memories of playing basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood. However, it's also where I experienced one of my worst moments - getting elbowed in the nose while playing football. The good memories far outweigh the bad, and whenever I visit the park now, it's to spend time with my cousin's energetic kids. They love the swings and slides, and it brings back nostalgic feelings. The neighborhood is also quite diverse, with a wide range of cuisines available within a one-mile radius. You can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants nearby, but many people now opt for food delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash. The popular fast food joints are always busy, but you can find these in most suburban neighborhoods. There are also plenty of pizza places and diverse stores, including an Indian-owned store for those craving homemade Indian food or ready-made options. Overall, I'm grateful for my neighborhood. Seeing the horror stories of other people's neighborhood experiences on social media and the news makes me appreciate mine even more.",
            "Our little neighborhood in South Carolina is a quaint town that doesn't stand out from the crowd. However, it's made a significant name for itself in the agriculture sector. The town proudly calls itself the Peach Capital of the World, a title that's showcased on its welcoming sign. The town is mostly made up of vast farmlands, with either peach trees or cattle taking over the landscape. Houses outside of the town center are spaced out, with most being two-story homes featuring metal roofs to combat the scorching summer heat or gray shingles. These homes are often located far from the main road, allowing the front fields to be used for animals and crops. The town center, on the other hand, is where you'll find a single four-way stop light and a few stores. There are three fast-food places to choose from: Hong Kong, a small family-run Chinese restaurant; Fiesta Mexican Restaurant; or Gary's, a small burger chain. We used to have a pizzeria, but it closed down not too long ago. There's a small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug, which is surprisingly famous for selling Cherry Coca-Cola. The only grocery store in town is Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, which is a bit pricey. While it's the only option, many people prefer to drive to the Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville to buy most of their groceries. The most popular store in town, however, is Dollar General, which sells a wide range of everyday items and is always bustling from opening to closing time. There's also a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who's well-respected in the community. The store has been around for a long time and even employs movers who'll deliver the furniture to your doorstep. Next to the furniture store is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels, which offers various services like daycare, boarding, grooming, and more. The doctor's and veterinary practices are located outside of the main town area, but they're small and well-equipped to take care of the town's residents. We have a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School, and once kids complete fifth grade, they have to attend middle and high school in the next town over. Although there aren't any parks in town, we're currently building a 2.5-acre recreational area to provide families with more opportunities to spend time together and attract new visitors and residents. Despite its limitations, our town is a lovely place, so small that you could drive through it without even noticing it!",
            "I remember when I first heard about my apartment complex. It was while listening to a podcast about people who went missing, which was quite surprising. Almost every apartment in the area had rent prices over a thousand dollars a month, and I had never heard about that story or any of my friends had. It might be the harsh reality of life. I've seen some friends of mine cry themselves to sleep at night, struggling to make ends meet. Despite the high costs of living, we've learned to adapt and live with less. You start to grow fond of the musty smell of second-hand toys and old, stored clothes. It's different from the smell of adulthood, which is more like dusty magazines stacked on a dusty piano. The smell seeps into the leather and remains even after you clean it. There are three thrift stores within walking distance from my place. Starting from the far end, you can visit two charity thrift stores, a library, a rare bookshop, and a curio shop. Even though the streets are bustling with cars and people, the thrift stores are surprisingly quiet. It's a great spot to spend an afternoon. Every year, the city becomes more crowded, with more cars and people swarming in. They say it's a developing city, with one of the largest e-commerce and delivery empires headquartered here, but it still shows signs of growing pains. It reminds me of New York, where everyone is focused on their goals, and no one really asks for much from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you be. It's quite different from the South, where being a bit concerned about someone means you genuinely care. Here, you can keep to yourself and the city will just move on like the waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be, with the pianist next door and the two amateur singers upstairs always adding to the atmosphere. In a way, we're not just apartment-mates, but a community of friends who come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other out. I'm lucky to live here, and I really like most of my neighbors. They treat me well, and I try to reciprocate by keeping my space clean and leaving them little gifts. It's nice to see them and I think they enjoy my company just as much as I do theirs. Despite living in a massive, impersonal modernist complex, it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally mess up my life.",
            "The place I live in is pretty much like any other cookie-cutter suburbia. The streets seem to blend together, but my neighborhood sticks out thanks to its strict homeowner's association. As you drive in, you'll see rows of tidy single-family homes that all have the same vibe. Each front yard has a nicely manicured lawn, some decorative pebbles, and a short driveway. You might even spot a small tree or two here and there. Everyone has a two-car garage, and the roads are always well-maintained, with no potholes in sight. Most houses are one-story, but you'll sometimes see two-story ones too. One thing that's a bit different is the way we get our mail. Instead of individual mailboxes in front of each house, we have a big cluster of mailboxes at the end of the street that we access with a key. There are also two larger lockers for packages, thanks to the HOA's love of uniformity. My house is situated right at the edge of the city, so our neighborhood feels like a mix of rural and suburban. We have a lot of space for everything, which is great for outdoor activities. There's a well-maintained community pool that's gated and accessible to anyone living here. We also have walking trails where you can take your dog for a walk or go for a solo evening stroll. You don't need to visit a park to get some exercise – just walk around the neighborhood and you'll get a good workout. The community is mostly made up of retirees, but we also have some middle-aged and young professionals. The area is super safe, and everyone looks out for each other. When it comes to the city, it's surprisingly big in terms of population, but it still has a small-town feel. We've got all the amenities you'd expect, from a mall to high-end grocery stores and bargain outlets. It takes me about 15 minutes to drive to anywhere significant, but once you get there, you've got a ton of stores to choose from. We've got everything from fancy organic food stores to budget-friendly outlets with minimal staff. All in all, my neighborhood is a great place to live – it's safe, well-maintained, and has plenty of nice features like pools and walking trails. Just hop in your car and you're off to any major store you want.",
            "Yesterday, I reflected on my life in this small Midwestern town. It's situated on the outskirts of a major city, with a suburban area nearby. My neighborhood is located on the east side, and it's been described as the economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are generally low here, and most homes are either rented out or owned by low-income families. However, it's not a run-down or unpleasant place. My neighbors are friendly folks who greet me warmly whenever I walk down the street. Crime rates might be slightly higher than other parts of town, but we still manage to keep it under control. There have been a few violent incidents in the past decade, including some shootings and a homicide. A family we know personally lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Luckily, we haven't been directly affected by crime, except for the occasional missing item from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. My town has been severely impacted by the opioid epidemic that's been plaguing the country. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses, and it's been a challenge for us to cope with it. However, we have a few resources available to combat this issue, such as rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those struggling with addiction. Despite the challenges, my town has its positives. The elementary school my son attends has an excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. My son has special needs, but he's never faced bullying due to the positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that organizes various events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. The school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child has to go hungry. We have a zero-tolerance policy towards anyone feeling less than due to financial constraints, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made significant improvements to the town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side, where I live, tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for my neighbors and me. Despite this, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options to meet our needs, and although our home may not be worth much, it's comfortable and suitable for us. We've lived here for over 16 years, and I couldn't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is a melting pot of cultures, nestled on a hill surrounded by historic buildings that reflect its rich heritage. My apartment, a 7-story high-rise, faces the old theater, while just a block away, an arcade bar is the hotspot for people from all walks of life on warm summer nights. During June and July weekends, you'll often spot a line of people waiting to get in. The nearby city park is a tranquil oasis, with its expansive size considering its location. Concrete walls with stairs encircle the park, providing a sense of security. During the harsh winter months, homeless individuals set up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and steps, taking advantage of the proximity to the city's only family center, where they can access basic amenities like bathing and showering facilities. What I appreciate most about my city, though, isn't its picturesque architecture or historic landmarks. It's the people themselves who make this place special. You see, Hilltop once had a notorious reputation for gang violence, with stories of federal officials and the DEA sweeping in to clean up the streets still being passed down through generations. Despite its rough reputation, the community has worked hard to keep the area clean and cared for. They take pride in their city and neighborhood, as evident in the way they look out for one another. Some say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill at night, a warning that still lingers from the past and is tainted with social conditioning. I believe this warning is a reminder of the racism and assumptions that plague our nation, even in a city that prides itself as a melting pot. I'm grateful to be part of this community, where I've experienced kindness and generosity from strangers. Walking the streets at night, I've been offered jackets, phone charges, and words of encouragement from people who have seen beyond my skin color. It's a place where I feel at home, where I'm reminded that I'm valued and beautiful, even on the darkest of nights.",
            "I reside in a small town in rural America, specifically in Michigan, where the landscape transitions seamlessly from farmland to quaint tourist towns. You won't find massive shopping malls like Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee's here. Every time I need to go somewhere, I have to hit the road. But despite this, I live in one of the most breathtaking locations in the world, surrounded by water. My town is flanked by two incredible lakes: the majestic Lake Michigan and the serene Lake Charlevoix. Every spot you visit has its own little beach, inviting you to dip your toes in the cool waters. My neighborhood perfectly encapsulates the essence of a small town. The houses are not stacked haphazardly on top of one another; instead, they're unique, older homes that have been lovingly restored or updated. Many of the houses have basements that are visible from the street, and they're often adorned with beautiful, weathered aluminum siding. The neighborhood is a kaleidoscope of colors, with houses of every hue and style that surround my home. Most of the houses have spacious yards, complete with trampolines, playsets, and sometimes even gardens and fences for pets. The overall atmosphere is quintessentially Midwestern: hardworking people, families, and a strong sense of community. On any given day, you'll see kids running freely through the streets, people walking their dogs, biking, or rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors, and it's easy to spot those who are new to the area. You'll often see someone grilling outside and waving, or a neighbor from a few blocks away walking their dog and smiling warmly. The lawns are meticulously maintained, with neatly cut grass and tidy gardens. It's not a neighborhood that's going to leave you awestruck with its grandeur, but it's a place that exudes a sense of comfort, peace, and safety. Within walking distance, you'll find the county sheriff's department, the health department, and the city recycling center, which serves the community with valuable services. The nearby baseball and softball fields are always bustling with activity, and the sound of announcers calling out player names and keeping score is a familiar soundtrack to our town. Our small town airport is also nearby, adding to the lively atmosphere. You can easily walk to the local ice cream shop or bike to the park, which is just a few blocks away. It's an ideal place to call home."
