            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "My city is a melting pot, with a diverse range of communities living together in the same area. Residential areas seem to pop up randomly alongside shops, restaurants, and entertainment spots, creating a lively atmosphere. Everywhere you look, there are new eateries to try and stores to explore. While some of these stores are big-name brands, others are smaller, independent boutiques that line the streets and are often within walking distance from quiet neighborhoods. The place is also dotted with nearby parks, which are always bustling with families with young kids. When it comes to the people, my neighborhood is a true microcosm of the world, with a thriving LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a significant number of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union all living in the same area. If you venture a bit further out, you'll find even more diverse communities, each with their own little enclaves, such as Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia. However, these areas are only a stone's throw away, yet the traffic can be a nightmare, especially during rush hour, when a 10-mile journey can take two hours. It's not surprising that hardly anyone walks anywhere, given the sheer size of the city and the congested roads. The result is some of the worst traffic in the world, and finding parking spots can be a real challenge. Paradoxically, the city has seen a lot of construction in recent years, with new apartment buildings sprouting up left and right. While this might make it a popular destination, many residents are worried about the influx of new people and the subsequent increase in traffic. When it comes to housing, there's a wide range of options to choose from, from large apartment buildings to single-family homes, duplexes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Even within my immediate neighborhood, I've noticed a diverse range of housing options, and the people who live here are just as varied, with different ages and backgrounds. While it's not a tight-knit community like it used to be, I still have fond memories of playing with my next-door neighbor and a few other friends from the neighborhood when I was younger.",
            "My neighborhood's got character. The majority of the houses are standalone family homes, but you'll find a few that have been split into two, still connected, if that makes sense. My place has a small front yard and a driveway to the left, much like the ones surrounding it. It's like stepping back in time, a reminder of when suburban living was the quintessential American dream. Although that dream seems to be fading away, my neighborhood and many others still hold on to it, a beacon of what once was. The people here aren't as optimistic as they used to be, the upkeep's not what it used to be, but there's still a car or two in every driveway, and the youth still play like the world revolves around them. The old public school, which has been here for nearly 90 years, still stands, still symbolizing a future for the young and stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are scarce and mostly empty, but the basketball courts are always packed. The homes may look different, but they feel the same. There's a large supermarket called Super A, owned by a big Yemeni family, who just so happen to be the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The majority of residents are African American. The streets are wide, and kids usually play football, only stopping for cars to pass. Most of the people here have been here for generations, and many can tell stories of a time when everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school, but after the karate movies stopped being popular, the kids lost interest, and it's now a pharmacy. I guess some people think that taking medicine makes everything better, although I'm not so sure. We also have a small movie theater that screens old films at a discounted price. The youth aren't too interested, but the older folks love it as a cheap way to get out for a night, minus the kids, of course. We have an expressway running through our town, but the entrance and exit are actually in the neighboring town. There was a petition to get an exit in our town, but the youth supported it, while the older folks were against it, claiming it would ruin the town. In the end, they convinced the city council to deny the request. We're building a new high school, and we're trying to decide on a mascot for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the best representation of our town.",
            "At first glance, it may seem unassuming, tucked away behind a strip of shops - not the kind of place you'd expect to find homes, let alone thriving communities. But venture behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk past the hotels that sit vacant most of the year, except for the occasional summer family gathering, and you'll stumble upon a hidden gem. This otherwise unassuming area is actually home to a bustling neighborhood, where apartment complexes line the streets like intricately arranged building blocks.\n\nOne of these complexes has made headlines for some unsavory dealings, but we'll leave that aside for now - appearances can be deceiving. The apartments beside it, and the ones beside those, tell a different story - one that's largely unknown to those living in the area. Across from these complexes is a community college's branch campus, a quiet cluster of buildings standing watch over the road. Students filter in, sipping coffee and yawning as they start their day at 7 am, while commuters behind them grumble at the traffic congestion.\n\nThe road intersects with another residential street, lined with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for those with broken bones. The treatment center boasts cheerful outdoor furniture and a lazily spinning ceiling fan, stirring the hot summer air. Kids run freely in the park, doing somersaults and twirling in the grass as bees lazily flit between the flowers. Retirees walk their dogs on the walking path, shooting disapproving glances at the teenagers on skateboards and nodding politely at the cluster of teenage girls gossiping by the playground.\n\nA strip mall nearby houses a sushi restaurant with affordable food, a swimming supply store, and a nail salon. You can fill up your pool and get a manicure at the same time - the perfect combination of convenience and relaxation. There's also a DIY frozen yogurt shop, where teens often grab cups of cold, dripping yogurt and toppings while they skateboard and vape, thinking they're the coolest. This neighborhood is a quintessential slice of Americana, a time capsule in the quiet south where time seems to stand still.",
            "As we drove past the endless cornfields that filled the horizon, she asked, \"Where are we?\" I knew she'd be surprised by the vast open space. She was from a town where the convenience store was just a 5-minute walk from her house, and she'd never seen so much emptiness. I shared with her what it's like growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood where I came from. The road unwinds like a ribbon through a sea of corn, accompanied by a quarry that's home to a calm lake. Just beyond it lies my home in a small development where houses stand proudly with their brick and stucco facades. Each house boasts at least half an acre of land, which we all take great pride in maintaining. Every spring, the landscape transforms with an explosion of colorful flowers and trees that change colors with each passing season. The driveways are lined with sleek Mercedes-Benz luxury cars, glistening in the sunlight after a refreshing wash. As we continue down the road, my grey stucco home comes into view, and you'll likely catch a glimpse of my friendly Korean neighbor, always tending to his lawn with a warm smile. He spends his days mowing the grass and singing over the hum of his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Everyone in the neighborhood adores him, but beneath his friendly demeanor lies a rich history - he was once a doctor and has lost some of his wit as the years have passed. He blends in with the grass and his trusty mower, a sight that brings smiles to our faces. Eventually, you'll reach my house, where geese roam freely in the side yard, chased by our energetic Terrier. Behind my home lies a tranquil stream that feeds into the quarry, accompanied by the soothing sounds of bullfrogs, the gentle flow of the stream, and the occasional \"moo\" from the nearby farms. Across the rustic wooden bridge lies an untouched haven, teeming with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was where I spent most of my childhood, creating memories with friends and siblings - building tree forts, chasing after wild animals (or at least, trying to!), and enjoying the simple joys of childhood. Our winters can be harsh, but there's nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a lush green landscape to a barren wilderness, with the once-vibrant flowers and trees standing as skeletal reminders of the changing seasons. And when snow falls, a winter wonderland appears overnight, complete with snow angels made by my little sister and snowmen that stand guard over our little domain. My sister and I may have fought often as kids, but during the winter, snowballs were our trusty companions, and our backyard transformed into an arsenal of forts and branches. In our own little world, we were carefree kids, living in a winter wonderland where nothing else mattered.",
            "To truly grasp the essence of Portland, Oregon, you need to grasp the concept of \"weird\". The unofficial town motto, scribbled on the back of a building that's a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and a little bit of a lawbreaker, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". Some see this as a nostalgic call to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's - a place that was lesser-known, more affordable, and gave rise to unique and innovative subcultures. Others see it as an invitation - come to Portland, where you'll still be called weird, but this time as a compliment. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the constant construction of condominiums for these Californians, Portland remains weird. Being weird doesn't mean we're always accepting, but it means we accept things that others wouldn't normally accept. Weird doesn't mean we're devoid of modern conveniences and modern struggles. Like everywhere else, we buy most of our goods from China. Being weird comes in a million forms, a million ways of being not normal, but Portland's got plenty of normal too. Portland has yoga, hipsters, and business professionals. Maybe being weird just means we take all this less seriously. In my neighborhood, like many Portland neighborhoods, the streets are lined with colorful houses, home gardens bursting with flowers, herbs, and vegetables, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are essentially cardboard containers or plastic bags with unwanted items, but sometimes you'll stumble upon something magical - a treasure tailored to the person wandering by. Free boxes can contain anything from clothes and books to anything else you can imagine. The thrill of strolling through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about, from my perspective, but I'm just one of the thousands of weird Portlanders. Some people I live among wouldn't dare pick through the contents of a box on the sidewalk. They'd rather attend goat yoga (yes, yoga with live goats) or a Timbers match (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things and pursue their passions, or at least dream about pursuing them, while having one too many drinks at the bar. Unfortunately, Portland also has a drug problem, which stems from underlying mental health issues, and the constant drizzle and cloudy skies might be contributing to it. The city also struggles with homelessness, and no one seems to know the solution. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, which are better than in most parts of the country, but they're still insufficient. The non-homeless population is torn between compassion and disdain. In this, we're not weird at all.",
            "The mountains stand tall and unyielding in the north, their presence a constant reminder of the passage of time as the sun rises and sets. Their solidity is unwavering, unchanging despite my preoccupation with life's everyday struggles. It's as if they silently demand my attention on the most trying days, offering me a chance to temporarily lay my anxious thoughts to rest and find solace in their unshakeable strength. My journey here started when I first began my university studies, and it was the mountains north of campus that initially drew me in. While the university itself boasts its own share of breathtaking scenery, from buildings to ponds and trees that have a piece of my heart, the mountains hold a special place. The town is lovely in its own right, with its charming cafés where I've spent countless hours fueled by coffee and cram sessions. A short walk or bus ride takes me to the downtown area, where the faded bricks of old buildings envelop me in a sense of history and antiquity. The contrast between this laid-back atmosphere and the bustling urban city nearby is a big part of what makes this town so endearing. This dichotomy of worlds existing side by side makes it easy to create lasting memories, each tied to a specific part of town. Whether it's strolling past the rusted swings in the park after a long night of studying or racing through the downtown streets to catch a movie at the cinema, every moment is a treasure. However, as with any place, there are also memories that are harder to cherish, memories that remind us of life's complexities. The ponds, in particular, can be a poignant place for reflection and introspection, especially during those late-night existential crises when the world seems overwhelming. As I wander past the pond, the park, and the quaint houses that remind me of the comforts of suburbia, I find myself drawn towards the main street. It's there, under the golden glow of the sunrise painting the sky, that I catch sight of the mountains in all their glory. Their stature and presence are a constant reminder of my own strength and perseverance, and in that moment, I am reminded of the importance of staying the course.",
            "If you're planning a trip to Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you won't have a hard time finding it - public transport is easy to access and a super popular mode of transport in New York City. Bensonhurt's a fairly urban area, so you'll still get that New York City vibe. When you're there, get ready to see loads of Asian stores around every corner. Over the years, Bensonhurt's become a hotspot for Asians, and you'll notice an Asian-owned store every few blocks as you walk around. Supermarkets and laundromats are the most popular ones - they're super convenient, with great food quality, super cheap prices, and super efficient services. Just around my place, there are four Asian supermarkets within a 2-minute walk from each other - talk about convenience! Now, don't get me wrong, Bensonhurt's not all Asian - it's super diverse, with immigrants and their American-born kids living here. Most of the big businesses in the area are Asian-owned, but you'll also find a renovated park nearby with loads of facilities - 10 basketball courts, a big field for soccer or baseball, 4 handball courts, swings, a kids' playground, and even a water fountain for the summer. Since we're in New York City, you'll see a mix of everything here - all sorts of people getting along just fine. Unlike the city's corporate buildings, Bensonhurt's mostly got co-op living and condo apartments, with a few two-family houses here and there. The people are generally nice, but be prepared for some noise pollution - you'll hear cars blasting music and speeding by, and some folks can be a bit rowdy. If you're visiting at night, just be aware of your surroundings - the area's generally safe, but you never know when you might run into someone causing trouble. I've had my share of run-ins with troublemakers in the past, so be cautious. Plus, keep an eye out for package thieves - they're a thing here. One last thing - people don't always follow the rules about cleaning up after their dogs, so be prepared to see dog waste on the streets. My biggest pet peeve? Dog waste everywhere I go - keep your shoes clean and watch where you step!",
            "Living in my area, I've come to realize that sidewalks are a rare sight. We have a really steep hill in our neighborhood, often referred to as the \"workout hill\" due to the numerous joggers who use it as part of their daily routine. With no sidewalks on my street, pedestrians are forced to walk on the road, which can be hazardous due to the potholes and uneven surface. Our road is also lined with worn-out telephone and electric wires that look like they're on their last leg. The frequent storms and heavy rainfall in our area often cause branches and debris to knock down the power lines, leading to a patchwork of repairs. The scene is dominated by tall evergreen trees, but strangely, people here tend to see them as a nuisance, cutting them down to get a clear view of the ocean. Many houses are built high up on the hill, with expansive glass windows to take in the breathtaking view of the bay. It's truly stunning during sunset, when the water below seems to glow and the sky turns a vibrant orange. However, this sight is often obstructed by the overcast skies that prevail most days, casting a haze over the scenery. As a result, moss grows abundantly on everything it can find - roofs, cars, and railings alike. I once left my car parked for a month, and when I returned, it was covered in a thick layer of moss that took three hours to remove. Our neighborhood is home to a few schools, but it's mostly populated by older folks, many of whom have retired. Dogs are a common sight, with many owners letting them roam freely in their lawns or racing them down the street. Be careful not to leave your door or window open, or you might find a curious canine sneaking in. I once found one lounging in my living room, and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits also run wild in our area, and while some are quite large, they're a nuisance to gardeners who see them digging up plants and burrowing into lawns. My cats, on the other hand, seem to enjoy the thrill of the hunt, and have managed to drive most of them out of our neighborhood. We also have a variety of birds, including small sparrows and hummingbirds, as well as the occasional hawk or eagle that swoops by until the crows chase it off. While there are no stores nearby, a short hike down to the waterfront reveals a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. The beach itself isn't impressive, but the rocks along the shore make for a fun spot to skip stones into the water. The bay is relatively narrow, and on most days, you can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist.",
            "Me and my family, my wife and two daughters, ages 11 and 14, live in a typical suburban area in a small town in Tennessee. Our street is like a main artery connecting two state highways, which means we get more traffic than we'd like, but overall it's a peaceful neighborhood. Not many people move in or out, so I'm familiar with most of the folks around here. Everyone keeps busy with yard work and daily chores. In the winters, we enjoy sledding down a hill on our side street, right at the front corner of our street where our house is located. We see everything that's going on from our house since it's a central spot on the street. When we see a strange car, we take note of it. Some neighbors go for walks or walk their dogs, while the kids ride their bikes. With us working from home, we're often around. It's just the four of us, so I'd say our neighbors are used to seeing us come and go. We like to get outside, even on rainy days. Sometimes we grill on our back deck, and the smell of barbecue is always a delight. There's always someone cutting grass around here, so we hear lawn mowers almost daily from March to October, when the grass slows down. Our neighborhood was originally wooded, so we have plenty of trees, providing shade but also a lot of leaves in the fall, which means raking and burning them every year. I love the smell of burning leaves, signaling the start of fall. Lately, we haven't been experiencing much winter, so it just feels like an extended fall. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we usually use the back door, unless someone knocks on the front door, which is rare. When I'm working on my truck or projects in the garage with the doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, things get pretty quiet around here. We get some visitors from out of town on Thanksgiving and other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas, which brings more cars around. Overall, I really like living here. If it weren't for the through street, it'd be perfect.",
            "I live in a neighborhood smack in the middle of the high desert, surrounded by dirt and nothing much else. Unless you've experienced living here, you can't really grasp the feeling of seeing brown everywhere you look. If you do come across a lawn, you know that person is shelling out a fortune on lawn care. When I first moved here in the 90s, houses were spread out, but it wasn't as crowded as it is now. There are a lot more people and new additions, making the area look more and more like a city every day. Most places are changing the same way, I guess. The people here are generally friendly, but like any city, you've got your ups and downs. I'm lucky to live in a pretty nice neighborhood surrounded by friendly old folks. The shops around here are mostly chain stores like Food for Less and Smart and Final. If you want to go organic, you'll have to travel a bit. I rarely see any Whole Foods or similar stores around. The dominant profession in our city, from what I've observed, is construction. I think it's because our city is still pretty undeveloped, leaving plenty of wide open spaces to build on. To be honest, that scares me a bit - I prefer things the way they are. I left a big city behind, and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction, that's the field where I work full-time as a drywall and T-bar installer. What I love about my home is the variety of animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, including its stark beauty. The unique high desert climate and topography create challenging ecosystems that need our protection and are home to diverse wildlife. As a resident, it's essential to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment with us, so we can coexist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted well to the local wildlife. My three kids are obsessed with lizards and desert bugs, and as I write this, they're outside trying to catch different specimens. As for attractions, we have a few. Victorville is a great place for families to experience the desert, offering a unique experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with the annual San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will add a great mix of activities and fun to your visit, showcasing the Victorville way. Head to nearby Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to cap off your visit. If you're interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem, check out the Victor Valley Museum, which features geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of Victorville's development and industry.",
            "Hmmm...when people ask me to describe my neighborhood, my answer's gonna be pretty different, I'm sure. Most others who answer this question are probably homeowners living their own lives, but I'm a bit of an exception. My neighborhood's actually the college campus I live on, and my dorm-mates are basically my community. The surrounding campus is also part of my neighborhood, but to a lesser extent. Despite being a bit unusual, my neighborhood shares some similarities with the usual ideas about neighborhoods. Like any typical neighborhood, my campus has houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's start with the 'houses' in my neighborhood. By the way, there are three types of housing here – apartments, normal houses, and dormitories. First, in the apartments, each room usually has 2-4 people, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. Each building can have about 2 floors, so that's around 20 people living in each one. Second, there are normal houses that are available for school affiliates to rent – usually 2-4 bedrooms. However, they're quite rare, as they're not the most efficient option. Lastly, there are the typical dorm rooms where hundreds of students live, usually 2 people sharing a room, except in some cases. These are the most common type of housing here. Now that we've covered housing, let's move on to the people. My school's all about diversity, and this is reflected in the neighborhood. We have people from all sorts of cultures and ages living here. The professionals usually stay in the houses, while the new students live in the dorms and the older students live in apartments. Talking about the people here is a bit hard to sum up, so let's just move on to the stores and parks. Since my school is pretty much its own neighborhood, it has plenty of stores and a single park. The stores have a mix of dining options and the school's unique clothing and grocery stores. You can pretty much find everything you need within the neighborhood. The park's a playground for all the diverse people here, kept clean and crime-free by everyone in the neighborhood.",
            "I've been living in this neighborhood for almost 10 years now, and I think it's time for me to share some of my experiences. When I first moved here from Riverdale to Stockbridge, I was really sad - I missed my old home and the people there. But my parents wanted the best for my sister and me, so we moved to a new area with better housing and a better school. It was a big change, but over time, I got used to it and made some new friends and even some enemies at school. However, I never really got to know my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis, who lived right next door. They've been like family to me, and I appreciate them a lot. I remember attending Mr. Glen's wedding, and it was an amazing experience - I even caught the little strap from Ms. Veda's leg when she threw it away! We all danced and had a great time, and I'm looking forward to having a similar celebration someday when I'm successful and can give my future wife the life she deserves. I also had a great time with Marsharii, Mr. Glen's daughter, but I haven't seen her since then. I hope she's doing well. Our neighborhood is like a maze, but now that I have a GPS, I can explore it more. I've only gone so far, and most of the time, it's been with my friends Kason and Curtis - we used to love playing video games together and just enjoying life. Sometimes, I'd go to the park and appreciate nature, which really calms me down. It gives me a sense of peace and tranquility. I'd also bring sticks from Home Depot and practice my balance, and I even bring my bokken wooden sword if I can. It's a lot of fun doing what I love. We also have a basketball and tennis court, although I haven't played in a long time - it's nice to have the option to pick it up again if I want to. My dad taught me and my best friend tennis with Mr. Graves, and we always had a great time - they worked us hard, but we always enjoyed it. There are a lot of good memories here, but these are some of the ones that stand out to me, and I think the best times are yet to come!",
            "I'm pretty lucky to be living near the college I attend. It's just a short walk away, so I get to enjoy the convenience. The area's got a mix of apartment buildings and some pretty affordable restaurants and bars that are fun to hang out at. One of the bars just changed its name, and it's a bit pricier, but the service and drinks aren't bad. Most of the people around here are either students like me or lower-income folks, thanks to the affordable housing. There's a lot of families with kids living here because there's an elementary school nearby. To be honest, I don't really know my neighbors, and I'm not really looking to. They're always smoking pot, and the management had to put an air freshener in front of their unit, which my boyfriend and I found hilarious. It's almost like they're taunting us. The building I live in is a bit old, but the interior's been renovated. Down the street, there are some brand new apartments that look nice, but I'm not a fan. They're cheaply made, but the rent's pretty steep, which seems like a rip-off. I think it's because they're close to campus that they can get away with it. There's a super cheap eatery about a 5-minute walk from my place that serves food on paper plates and microwaves most of their meals. Across from that is a gas station that's not a great place to work. However, the city put in some money to redo the road last summer, and now we've got a nice big sidewalk, lots of greenery on the medians and sides of the road, and the area's looking a bit nicer. The apartment building I live in is surrounded by trees, but they cut a few down, so there are some stumps left. There are way more trees here than on the street down the block. Behind my apartment complex, there's a tree line and another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street, and that one's not as nice. The sidewalks are in bad shape, and most of the buildings look run down. There are a lot of trees on this street, but it's probably just to hide how bad the buildings look. Most of the crime around here has happened at an apartment complex on 43rd street, but I'm not gonna blame them entirely. There are apartments across from me with a lot of crime and a pretty transient population. Despite all that, I kinda like living here. It's affordable, and there are plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially love how the university's within walking distance, and there are two bus stops so I can easily get to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood is like a haven. It's made up of identical-looking duplexes on a cul-de-sac, but they feel like individual homes thanks to the unique way they're spaced out. Each one's painted a bright yellow with a white porch and a green metal roof. Most of us are like one big happy family, although we're not all exactly close. You'd often catch us standing at the end of our driveway some evenings, chatting away while the kids play with their toys, draw with sidewalk chalk, or fly their kites. In today's world that's all about technology and machines, it feels like we've stepped back in time. We're surrounded by vast fields, trees, and open skies with big, puffy white clouds. But, this season's been a bit of a mixed bag - we've had tornado warnings and, for the first time, the sirens actually went off last night, so we had to head for shelter. I was crouched in my bathtub, clutching my smallest dog and my purse, along with a few pillows for good measure. My bigger dog refused to join me, instead staying in the living room, barking nervously as he sensed something was off. The neighborhood was eerily quiet, except for the sound of hail pounding the ground. After the storm, the temperature dropped dramatically - we went from 92 to 75 degrees in just a few minutes. The hail melted instantly when it hit the scorching pavement. As the skies cleared, the sun came out and rain started pouring down, followed by a breathtaking double rainbow. I quickly grabbed my camera and snapped some pics to share with my friends and family on Facebook - they were just as amazed as I was. The streets stayed quiet for a bit, then people started trickling back home from wherever they'd been when the storm hit. Once again, it was business as usual - the moms and kids were back out, and the delicious smell of dinner wafted through the air. I've only recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina, and I'm loving the friendly vibe of my new neighborhood. Everyone speaks with that charming Southern accent that's so unique and endearing. Although all the houses look the same from the outside, each apartment's different on the inside - some are surprisingly tiny. It's a bit puzzling, but it doesn't take away from the charm of this place. I adore strolling through the biggest field behind my house and making my way to the pond, which is more of a scenic spot than a swimming hole. I've spotted deer, and in the mornings, you can hear the deep, melodious song of the bullfrog. It's a fantastic place to live, just a 40-minute drive from the city of Charlotte. Every morning starts with the cheerful sound of roosters crowing from the nearby farms - it's like living in a little village all its own. We even have a friendly donkey at a nearby farm that brays in the evening to let us know he's there. I feel lucky to have found this hidden gem of a neighborhood.",
            "I moved into this neighborhood on the eve of starting eighth grade, and it was a bit of a challenge to make friends initially. However, I eventually connected with a friend who lives just two houses down from me and another guy from my street. Although they no longer live here, the memories we shared remain vivid. The familiar faces from when I first moved here are still around, giving the neighborhood a sense of continuity. Our neighborhood bears a striking resemblance to a typical American suburban neighborhood - rows of two-story houses, the sound of kids playing outside on warm days, and an overall quiet atmosphere most of the week. I've never had any issues with my neighbors, and it's not unusual to be left to your own devices unless you need help. Online deliveries are also safe, with no packages ever going missing from my porch. This level of trust is rare, and I appreciate it. The park, just a minute or two away, holds a special place in my heart. I have fond memories of playing basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood. However, it's also where I experienced one of my worst moments - getting elbowed in the nose while playing football. The good memories far outweigh the bad, and whenever I visit the park now, it's to spend time with my cousin's energetic kids. They love the swings and slides, and it brings back nostalgic feelings. The neighborhood is also quite diverse, with a wide range of cuisines available within a one-mile radius. You can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants nearby, but many people now opt for food delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash. The popular fast food joints are always busy, but you can find these in most suburban neighborhoods. There are also plenty of pizza places and diverse stores, including an Indian-owned store for those craving homemade Indian food or ready-made options. Overall, I'm grateful for my neighborhood. Seeing the horror stories of other people's neighborhood experiences on social media and the news makes me appreciate mine even more.",
            "Our little neighborhood in South Carolina is a quaint town that doesn't stand out from the crowd. However, it's made a significant name for itself in the agriculture sector. The town proudly calls itself the Peach Capital of the World, a title that's showcased on its welcoming sign. The town is mostly made up of vast farmlands, with either peach trees or cattle taking over the landscape. Houses outside of the town center are spaced out, with most being two-story homes featuring metal roofs to combat the scorching summer heat or gray shingles. These homes are often located far from the main road, allowing the front fields to be used for animals and crops. The town center, on the other hand, is where you'll find a single four-way stop light and a few stores. There are three fast-food places to choose from: Hong Kong, a small family-run Chinese restaurant; Fiesta Mexican Restaurant; or Gary's, a small burger chain. We used to have a pizzeria, but it closed down not too long ago. There's a small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug, which is surprisingly famous for selling Cherry Coca-Cola. The only grocery store in town is Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, which is a bit pricey. While it's the only option, many people prefer to drive to the Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville to buy most of their groceries. The most popular store in town, however, is Dollar General, which sells a wide range of everyday items and is always bustling from opening to closing time. There's also a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who's well-respected in the community. The store has been around for a long time and even employs movers who'll deliver the furniture to your doorstep. Next to the furniture store is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels, which offers various services like daycare, boarding, grooming, and more. The doctor's and veterinary practices are located outside of the main town area, but they're small and well-equipped to take care of the town's residents. We have a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School, and once kids complete fifth grade, they have to attend middle and high school in the next town over. Although there aren't any parks in town, we're currently building a 2.5-acre recreational area to provide families with more opportunities to spend time together and attract new visitors and residents. Despite its limitations, our town is a lovely place, so small that you could drive through it without even noticing it!",
            "I remember when I first heard about my apartment complex. It was while listening to a podcast about people who went missing, which was quite surprising. Almost every apartment in the area had rent prices over a thousand dollars a month, and I had never heard about that story or any of my friends had. It might be the harsh reality of life. I've seen some friends of mine cry themselves to sleep at night, struggling to make ends meet. Despite the high costs of living, we've learned to adapt and live with less. You start to grow fond of the musty smell of second-hand toys and old, stored clothes. It's different from the smell of adulthood, which is more like dusty magazines stacked on a dusty piano. The smell seeps into the leather and remains even after you clean it. There are three thrift stores within walking distance from my place. Starting from the far end, you can visit two charity thrift stores, a library, a rare bookshop, and a curio shop. Even though the streets are bustling with cars and people, the thrift stores are surprisingly quiet. It's a great spot to spend an afternoon. Every year, the city becomes more crowded, with more cars and people swarming in. They say it's a developing city, with one of the largest e-commerce and delivery empires headquartered here, but it still shows signs of growing pains. It reminds me of New York, where everyone is focused on their goals, and no one really asks for much from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you be. It's quite different from the South, where being a bit concerned about someone means you genuinely care. Here, you can keep to yourself and the city will just move on like the waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be, with the pianist next door and the two amateur singers upstairs always adding to the atmosphere. In a way, we're not just apartment-mates, but a community of friends who come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other out. I'm lucky to live here, and I really like most of my neighbors. They treat me well, and I try to reciprocate by keeping my space clean and leaving them little gifts. It's nice to see them and I think they enjoy my company just as much as I do theirs. Despite living in a massive, impersonal modernist complex, it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally mess up my life.",
            "The place I live in is pretty much like any other cookie-cutter suburbia. The streets seem to blend together, but my neighborhood sticks out thanks to its strict homeowner's association. As you drive in, you'll see rows of tidy single-family homes that all have the same vibe. Each front yard has a nicely manicured lawn, some decorative pebbles, and a short driveway. You might even spot a small tree or two here and there. Everyone has a two-car garage, and the roads are always well-maintained, with no potholes in sight. Most houses are one-story, but you'll sometimes see two-story ones too. One thing that's a bit different is the way we get our mail. Instead of individual mailboxes in front of each house, we have a big cluster of mailboxes at the end of the street that we access with a key. There are also two larger lockers for packages, thanks to the HOA's love of uniformity. My house is situated right at the edge of the city, so our neighborhood feels like a mix of rural and suburban. We have a lot of space for everything, which is great for outdoor activities. There's a well-maintained community pool that's gated and accessible to anyone living here. We also have walking trails where you can take your dog for a walk or go for a solo evening stroll. You don't need to visit a park to get some exercise – just walk around the neighborhood and you'll get a good workout. The community is mostly made up of retirees, but we also have some middle-aged and young professionals. The area is super safe, and everyone looks out for each other. When it comes to the city, it's surprisingly big in terms of population, but it still has a small-town feel. We've got all the amenities you'd expect, from a mall to high-end grocery stores and bargain outlets. It takes me about 15 minutes to drive to anywhere significant, but once you get there, you've got a ton of stores to choose from. We've got everything from fancy organic food stores to budget-friendly outlets with minimal staff. All in all, my neighborhood is a great place to live – it's safe, well-maintained, and has plenty of nice features like pools and walking trails. Just hop in your car and you're off to any major store you want.",
            "Yesterday, I reflected on my life in this small Midwestern town. It's situated on the outskirts of a major city, with a suburban area nearby. My neighborhood is located on the east side, and it's been described as the economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are generally low here, and most homes are either rented out or owned by low-income families. However, it's not a run-down or unpleasant place. My neighbors are friendly folks who greet me warmly whenever I walk down the street. Crime rates might be slightly higher than other parts of town, but we still manage to keep it under control. There have been a few violent incidents in the past decade, including some shootings and a homicide. A family we know personally lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Luckily, we haven't been directly affected by crime, except for the occasional missing item from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. My town has been severely impacted by the opioid epidemic that's been plaguing the country. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses, and it's been a challenge for us to cope with it. However, we have a few resources available to combat this issue, such as rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those struggling with addiction. Despite the challenges, my town has its positives. The elementary school my son attends has an excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. My son has special needs, but he's never faced bullying due to the positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that organizes various events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. The school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child has to go hungry. We have a zero-tolerance policy towards anyone feeling less than due to financial constraints, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made significant improvements to the town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side, where I live, tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for my neighbors and me. Despite this, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options to meet our needs, and although our home may not be worth much, it's comfortable and suitable for us. We've lived here for over 16 years, and I couldn't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is a melting pot of cultures, nestled on a hill surrounded by historic buildings that reflect its rich heritage. My apartment, a 7-story high-rise, faces the old theater, while just a block away, an arcade bar is the hotspot for people from all walks of life on warm summer nights. During June and July weekends, you'll often spot a line of people waiting to get in. The nearby city park is a tranquil oasis, with its expansive size considering its location. Concrete walls with stairs encircle the park, providing a sense of security. During the harsh winter months, homeless individuals set up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and steps, taking advantage of the proximity to the city's only family center, where they can access basic amenities like bathing and showering facilities. What I appreciate most about my city, though, isn't its picturesque architecture or historic landmarks. It's the people themselves who make this place special. You see, Hilltop once had a notorious reputation for gang violence, with stories of federal officials and the DEA sweeping in to clean up the streets still being passed down through generations. Despite its rough reputation, the community has worked hard to keep the area clean and cared for. They take pride in their city and neighborhood, as evident in the way they look out for one another. Some say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill at night, a warning that still lingers from the past and is tainted with social conditioning. I believe this warning is a reminder of the racism and assumptions that plague our nation, even in a city that prides itself as a melting pot. I'm grateful to be part of this community, where I've experienced kindness and generosity from strangers. Walking the streets at night, I've been offered jackets, phone charges, and words of encouragement from people who have seen beyond my skin color. It's a place where I feel at home, where I'm reminded that I'm valued and beautiful, even on the darkest of nights.",
            "I reside in a small town in rural America, specifically in Michigan, where the landscape transitions seamlessly from farmland to quaint tourist towns. You won't find massive shopping malls like Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee's here. Every time I need to go somewhere, I have to hit the road. But despite this, I live in one of the most breathtaking locations in the world, surrounded by water. My town is flanked by two incredible lakes: the majestic Lake Michigan and the serene Lake Charlevoix. Every spot you visit has its own little beach, inviting you to dip your toes in the cool waters. My neighborhood perfectly encapsulates the essence of a small town. The houses are not stacked haphazardly on top of one another; instead, they're unique, older homes that have been lovingly restored or updated. Many of the houses have basements that are visible from the street, and they're often adorned with beautiful, weathered aluminum siding. The neighborhood is a kaleidoscope of colors, with houses of every hue and style that surround my home. Most of the houses have spacious yards, complete with trampolines, playsets, and sometimes even gardens and fences for pets. The overall atmosphere is quintessentially Midwestern: hardworking people, families, and a strong sense of community. On any given day, you'll see kids running freely through the streets, people walking their dogs, biking, or rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors, and it's easy to spot those who are new to the area. You'll often see someone grilling outside and waving, or a neighbor from a few blocks away walking their dog and smiling warmly. The lawns are meticulously maintained, with neatly cut grass and tidy gardens. It's not a neighborhood that's going to leave you awestruck with its grandeur, but it's a place that exudes a sense of comfort, peace, and safety. Within walking distance, you'll find the county sheriff's department, the health department, and the city recycling center, which serves the community with valuable services. The nearby baseball and softball fields are always bustling with activity, and the sound of announcers calling out player names and keeping score is a familiar soundtrack to our town. Our small town airport is also nearby, adding to the lively atmosphere. You can easily walk to the local ice cream shop or bike to the park, which is just a few blocks away. It's an ideal place to call home."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "My city is a melting pot, with a diverse range of communities living together in the same area. Residential areas seem to pop up randomly alongside shops, restaurants, and entertainment spots, creating a lively atmosphere. Everywhere you look, there are new eateries to try and stores to explore. While some of these stores are big-name brands, others are smaller, independent boutiques that line the streets and are often within walking distance from quiet neighborhoods. The place is also dotted with nearby parks, which are always bustling with families with young kids. When it comes to the people, my neighborhood is a true microcosm of the world, with a thriving LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a significant number of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union all living in the same area. If you venture a bit further out, you'll find even more diverse communities, each with their own little enclaves, such as Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia. However, these areas are only a stone's throw away, yet the traffic can be a nightmare, especially during rush hour, when a 10-mile journey can take two hours. It's not surprising that hardly anyone walks anywhere, given the sheer size of the city and the congested roads. The result is some of the worst traffic in the world, and finding parking spots can be a real challenge. Paradoxically, the city has seen a lot of construction in recent years, with new apartment buildings sprouting up left and right. While this might make it a popular destination, many residents are worried about the influx of new people and the subsequent increase in traffic. When it comes to housing, there's a wide range of options to choose from, from large apartment buildings to single-family homes, duplexes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Even within my immediate neighborhood, I've noticed a diverse range of housing options, and the people who live here are just as varied, with different ages and backgrounds. While it's not a tight-knit community like it used to be, I still have fond memories of playing with my next-door neighbor and a few other friends from the neighborhood when I was younger.",
            "My neighborhood's got character. The majority of the houses are standalone family homes, but you'll find a few that have been split into two, still connected, if that makes sense. My place has a small front yard and a driveway to the left, much like the ones surrounding it. It's like stepping back in time, a reminder of when suburban living was the quintessential American dream. Although that dream seems to be fading away, my neighborhood and many others still hold on to it, a beacon of what once was. The people here aren't as optimistic as they used to be, the upkeep's not what it used to be, but there's still a car or two in every driveway, and the youth still play like the world revolves around them. The old public school, which has been here for nearly 90 years, still stands, still symbolizing a future for the young and stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are scarce and mostly empty, but the basketball courts are always packed. The homes may look different, but they feel the same. There's a large supermarket called Super A, owned by a big Yemeni family, who just so happen to be the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The majority of residents are African American. The streets are wide, and kids usually play football, only stopping for cars to pass. Most of the people here have been here for generations, and many can tell stories of a time when everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school, but after the karate movies stopped being popular, the kids lost interest, and it's now a pharmacy. I guess some people think that taking medicine makes everything better, although I'm not so sure. We also have a small movie theater that screens old films at a discounted price. The youth aren't too interested, but the older folks love it as a cheap way to get out for a night, minus the kids, of course. We have an expressway running through our town, but the entrance and exit are actually in the neighboring town. There was a petition to get an exit in our town, but the youth supported it, while the older folks were against it, claiming it would ruin the town. In the end, they convinced the city council to deny the request. We're building a new high school, and we're trying to decide on a mascot for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the best representation of our town.",
            "At first glance, it may seem unassuming, tucked away behind a strip of shops - not the kind of place you'd expect to find homes, let alone thriving communities. But venture behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk past the hotels that sit vacant most of the year, except for the occasional summer family gathering, and you'll stumble upon a hidden gem. This otherwise unassuming area is actually home to a bustling neighborhood, where apartment complexes line the streets like intricately arranged building blocks.\n\nOne of these complexes has made headlines for some unsavory dealings, but we'll leave that aside for now - appearances can be deceiving. The apartments beside it, and the ones beside those, tell a different story - one that's largely unknown to those living in the area. Across from these complexes is a community college's branch campus, a quiet cluster of buildings standing watch over the road. Students filter in, sipping coffee and yawning as they start their day at 7 am, while commuters behind them grumble at the traffic congestion.\n\nThe road intersects with another residential street, lined with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for those with broken bones. The treatment center boasts cheerful outdoor furniture and a lazily spinning ceiling fan, stirring the hot summer air. Kids run freely in the park, doing somersaults and twirling in the grass as bees lazily flit between the flowers. Retirees walk their dogs on the walking path, shooting disapproving glances at the teenagers on skateboards and nodding politely at the cluster of teenage girls gossiping by the playground.\n\nA strip mall nearby houses a sushi restaurant with affordable food, a swimming supply store, and a nail salon. You can fill up your pool and get a manicure at the same time - the perfect combination of convenience and relaxation. There's also a DIY frozen yogurt shop, where teens often grab cups of cold, dripping yogurt and toppings while they skateboard and vape, thinking they're the coolest. This neighborhood is a quintessential slice of Americana, a time capsule in the quiet south where time seems to stand still.",
            "As we drove past the endless cornfields that filled the horizon, she asked, \"Where are we?\" I knew she'd be surprised by the vast open space. She was from a town where the convenience store was just a 5-minute walk from her house, and she'd never seen so much emptiness. I shared with her what it's like growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood where I came from. The road unwinds like a ribbon through a sea of corn, accompanied by a quarry that's home to a calm lake. Just beyond it lies my home in a small development where houses stand proudly with their brick and stucco facades. Each house boasts at least half an acre of land, which we all take great pride in maintaining. Every spring, the landscape transforms with an explosion of colorful flowers and trees that change colors with each passing season. The driveways are lined with sleek Mercedes-Benz luxury cars, glistening in the sunlight after a refreshing wash. As we continue down the road, my grey stucco home comes into view, and you'll likely catch a glimpse of my friendly Korean neighbor, always tending to his lawn with a warm smile. He spends his days mowing the grass and singing over the hum of his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Everyone in the neighborhood adores him, but beneath his friendly demeanor lies a rich history - he was once a doctor and has lost some of his wit as the years have passed. He blends in with the grass and his trusty mower, a sight that brings smiles to our faces. Eventually, you'll reach my house, where geese roam freely in the side yard, chased by our energetic Terrier. Behind my home lies a tranquil stream that feeds into the quarry, accompanied by the soothing sounds of bullfrogs, the gentle flow of the stream, and the occasional \"moo\" from the nearby farms. Across the rustic wooden bridge lies an untouched haven, teeming with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was where I spent most of my childhood, creating memories with friends and siblings - building tree forts, chasing after wild animals (or at least, trying to!), and enjoying the simple joys of childhood. Our winters can be harsh, but there's nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a lush green landscape to a barren wilderness, with the once-vibrant flowers and trees standing as skeletal reminders of the changing seasons. And when snow falls, a winter wonderland appears overnight, complete with snow angels made by my little sister and snowmen that stand guard over our little domain. My sister and I may have fought often as kids, but during the winter, snowballs were our trusty companions, and our backyard transformed into an arsenal of forts and branches. In our own little world, we were carefree kids, living in a winter wonderland where nothing else mattered.",
            "To truly grasp the essence of Portland, Oregon, you need to grasp the concept of \"weird\". The unofficial town motto, scribbled on the back of a building that's a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and a little bit of a lawbreaker, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". Some see this as a nostalgic call to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's - a place that was lesser-known, more affordable, and gave rise to unique and innovative subcultures. Others see it as an invitation - come to Portland, where you'll still be called weird, but this time as a compliment. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the constant construction of condominiums for these Californians, Portland remains weird. Being weird doesn't mean we're always accepting, but it means we accept things that others wouldn't normally accept. Weird doesn't mean we're devoid of modern conveniences and modern struggles. Like everywhere else, we buy most of our goods from China. Being weird comes in a million forms, a million ways of being not normal, but Portland's got plenty of normal too. Portland has yoga, hipsters, and business professionals. Maybe being weird just means we take all this less seriously. In my neighborhood, like many Portland neighborhoods, the streets are lined with colorful houses, home gardens bursting with flowers, herbs, and vegetables, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are essentially cardboard containers or plastic bags with unwanted items, but sometimes you'll stumble upon something magical - a treasure tailored to the person wandering by. Free boxes can contain anything from clothes and books to anything else you can imagine. The thrill of strolling through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about, from my perspective, but I'm just one of the thousands of weird Portlanders. Some people I live among wouldn't dare pick through the contents of a box on the sidewalk. They'd rather attend goat yoga (yes, yoga with live goats) or a Timbers match (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things and pursue their passions, or at least dream about pursuing them, while having one too many drinks at the bar. Unfortunately, Portland also has a drug problem, which stems from underlying mental health issues, and the constant drizzle and cloudy skies might be contributing to it. The city also struggles with homelessness, and no one seems to know the solution. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, which are better than in most parts of the country, but they're still insufficient. The non-homeless population is torn between compassion and disdain. In this, we're not weird at all.",
            "The mountains stand tall and unyielding in the north, their presence a constant reminder of the passage of time as the sun rises and sets. Their solidity is unwavering, unchanging despite my preoccupation with life's everyday struggles. It's as if they silently demand my attention on the most trying days, offering me a chance to temporarily lay my anxious thoughts to rest and find solace in their unshakeable strength. My journey here started when I first began my university studies, and it was the mountains north of campus that initially drew me in. While the university itself boasts its own share of breathtaking scenery, from buildings to ponds and trees that have a piece of my heart, the mountains hold a special place. The town is lovely in its own right, with its charming cafés where I've spent countless hours fueled by coffee and cram sessions. A short walk or bus ride takes me to the downtown area, where the faded bricks of old buildings envelop me in a sense of history and antiquity. The contrast between this laid-back atmosphere and the bustling urban city nearby is a big part of what makes this town so endearing. This dichotomy of worlds existing side by side makes it easy to create lasting memories, each tied to a specific part of town. Whether it's strolling past the rusted swings in the park after a long night of studying or racing through the downtown streets to catch a movie at the cinema, every moment is a treasure. However, as with any place, there are also memories that are harder to cherish, memories that remind us of life's complexities. The ponds, in particular, can be a poignant place for reflection and introspection, especially during those late-night existential crises when the world seems overwhelming. As I wander past the pond, the park, and the quaint houses that remind me of the comforts of suburbia, I find myself drawn towards the main street. It's there, under the golden glow of the sunrise painting the sky, that I catch sight of the mountains in all their glory. Their stature and presence are a constant reminder of my own strength and perseverance, and in that moment, I am reminded of the importance of staying the course.",
            "If you're planning a trip to Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you won't have a hard time finding it - public transport is easy to access and a super popular mode of transport in New York City. Bensonhurt's a fairly urban area, so you'll still get that New York City vibe. When you're there, get ready to see loads of Asian stores around every corner. Over the years, Bensonhurt's become a hotspot for Asians, and you'll notice an Asian-owned store every few blocks as you walk around. Supermarkets and laundromats are the most popular ones - they're super convenient, with great food quality, super cheap prices, and super efficient services. Just around my place, there are four Asian supermarkets within a 2-minute walk from each other - talk about convenience! Now, don't get me wrong, Bensonhurt's not all Asian - it's super diverse, with immigrants and their American-born kids living here. Most of the big businesses in the area are Asian-owned, but you'll also find a renovated park nearby with loads of facilities - 10 basketball courts, a big field for soccer or baseball, 4 handball courts, swings, a kids' playground, and even a water fountain for the summer. Since we're in New York City, you'll see a mix of everything here - all sorts of people getting along just fine. Unlike the city's corporate buildings, Bensonhurt's mostly got co-op living and condo apartments, with a few two-family houses here and there. The people are generally nice, but be prepared for some noise pollution - you'll hear cars blasting music and speeding by, and some folks can be a bit rowdy. If you're visiting at night, just be aware of your surroundings - the area's generally safe, but you never know when you might run into someone causing trouble. I've had my share of run-ins with troublemakers in the past, so be cautious. Plus, keep an eye out for package thieves - they're a thing here. One last thing - people don't always follow the rules about cleaning up after their dogs, so be prepared to see dog waste on the streets. My biggest pet peeve? Dog waste everywhere I go - keep your shoes clean and watch where you step!",
            "Living in my area, I've come to realize that sidewalks are a rare sight. We have a really steep hill in our neighborhood, often referred to as the \"workout hill\" due to the numerous joggers who use it as part of their daily routine. With no sidewalks on my street, pedestrians are forced to walk on the road, which can be hazardous due to the potholes and uneven surface. Our road is also lined with worn-out telephone and electric wires that look like they're on their last leg. The frequent storms and heavy rainfall in our area often cause branches and debris to knock down the power lines, leading to a patchwork of repairs. The scene is dominated by tall evergreen trees, but strangely, people here tend to see them as a nuisance, cutting them down to get a clear view of the ocean. Many houses are built high up on the hill, with expansive glass windows to take in the breathtaking view of the bay. It's truly stunning during sunset, when the water below seems to glow and the sky turns a vibrant orange. However, this sight is often obstructed by the overcast skies that prevail most days, casting a haze over the scenery. As a result, moss grows abundantly on everything it can find - roofs, cars, and railings alike. I once left my car parked for a month, and when I returned, it was covered in a thick layer of moss that took three hours to remove. Our neighborhood is home to a few schools, but it's mostly populated by older folks, many of whom have retired. Dogs are a common sight, with many owners letting them roam freely in their lawns or racing them down the street. Be careful not to leave your door or window open, or you might find a curious canine sneaking in. I once found one lounging in my living room, and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits also run wild in our area, and while some are quite large, they're a nuisance to gardeners who see them digging up plants and burrowing into lawns. My cats, on the other hand, seem to enjoy the thrill of the hunt, and have managed to drive most of them out of our neighborhood. We also have a variety of birds, including small sparrows and hummingbirds, as well as the occasional hawk or eagle that swoops by until the crows chase it off. While there are no stores nearby, a short hike down to the waterfront reveals a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. The beach itself isn't impressive, but the rocks along the shore make for a fun spot to skip stones into the water. The bay is relatively narrow, and on most days, you can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist.",
            "Me and my family, my wife and two daughters, ages 11 and 14, live in a typical suburban area in a small town in Tennessee. Our street is like a main artery connecting two state highways, which means we get more traffic than we'd like, but overall it's a peaceful neighborhood. Not many people move in or out, so I'm familiar with most of the folks around here. Everyone keeps busy with yard work and daily chores. In the winters, we enjoy sledding down a hill on our side street, right at the front corner of our street where our house is located. We see everything that's going on from our house since it's a central spot on the street. When we see a strange car, we take note of it. Some neighbors go for walks or walk their dogs, while the kids ride their bikes. With us working from home, we're often around. It's just the four of us, so I'd say our neighbors are used to seeing us come and go. We like to get outside, even on rainy days. Sometimes we grill on our back deck, and the smell of barbecue is always a delight. There's always someone cutting grass around here, so we hear lawn mowers almost daily from March to October, when the grass slows down. Our neighborhood was originally wooded, so we have plenty of trees, providing shade but also a lot of leaves in the fall, which means raking and burning them every year. I love the smell of burning leaves, signaling the start of fall. Lately, we haven't been experiencing much winter, so it just feels like an extended fall. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we usually use the back door, unless someone knocks on the front door, which is rare. When I'm working on my truck or projects in the garage with the doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, things get pretty quiet around here. We get some visitors from out of town on Thanksgiving and other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas, which brings more cars around. Overall, I really like living here. If it weren't for the through street, it'd be perfect.",
            "I live in a neighborhood smack in the middle of the high desert, surrounded by dirt and nothing much else. Unless you've experienced living here, you can't really grasp the feeling of seeing brown everywhere you look. If you do come across a lawn, you know that person is shelling out a fortune on lawn care. When I first moved here in the 90s, houses were spread out, but it wasn't as crowded as it is now. There are a lot more people and new additions, making the area look more and more like a city every day. Most places are changing the same way, I guess. The people here are generally friendly, but like any city, you've got your ups and downs. I'm lucky to live in a pretty nice neighborhood surrounded by friendly old folks. The shops around here are mostly chain stores like Food for Less and Smart and Final. If you want to go organic, you'll have to travel a bit. I rarely see any Whole Foods or similar stores around. The dominant profession in our city, from what I've observed, is construction. I think it's because our city is still pretty undeveloped, leaving plenty of wide open spaces to build on. To be honest, that scares me a bit - I prefer things the way they are. I left a big city behind, and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction, that's the field where I work full-time as a drywall and T-bar installer. What I love about my home is the variety of animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, including its stark beauty. The unique high desert climate and topography create challenging ecosystems that need our protection and are home to diverse wildlife. As a resident, it's essential to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment with us, so we can coexist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted well to the local wildlife. My three kids are obsessed with lizards and desert bugs, and as I write this, they're outside trying to catch different specimens. As for attractions, we have a few. Victorville is a great place for families to experience the desert, offering a unique experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with the annual San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will add a great mix of activities and fun to your visit, showcasing the Victorville way. Head to nearby Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to cap off your visit. If you're interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem, check out the Victor Valley Museum, which features geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of Victorville's development and industry.",
            "Hmmm...when people ask me to describe my neighborhood, my answer's gonna be pretty different, I'm sure. Most others who answer this question are probably homeowners living their own lives, but I'm a bit of an exception. My neighborhood's actually the college campus I live on, and my dorm-mates are basically my community. The surrounding campus is also part of my neighborhood, but to a lesser extent. Despite being a bit unusual, my neighborhood shares some similarities with the usual ideas about neighborhoods. Like any typical neighborhood, my campus has houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's start with the 'houses' in my neighborhood. By the way, there are three types of housing here – apartments, normal houses, and dormitories. First, in the apartments, each room usually has 2-4 people, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. Each building can have about 2 floors, so that's around 20 people living in each one. Second, there are normal houses that are available for school affiliates to rent – usually 2-4 bedrooms. However, they're quite rare, as they're not the most efficient option. Lastly, there are the typical dorm rooms where hundreds of students live, usually 2 people sharing a room, except in some cases. These are the most common type of housing here. Now that we've covered housing, let's move on to the people. My school's all about diversity, and this is reflected in the neighborhood. We have people from all sorts of cultures and ages living here. The professionals usually stay in the houses, while the new students live in the dorms and the older students live in apartments. Talking about the people here is a bit hard to sum up, so let's just move on to the stores and parks. Since my school is pretty much its own neighborhood, it has plenty of stores and a single park. The stores have a mix of dining options and the school's unique clothing and grocery stores. You can pretty much find everything you need within the neighborhood. The park's a playground for all the diverse people here, kept clean and crime-free by everyone in the neighborhood.",
            "I've been living in this neighborhood for almost 10 years now, and I think it's time for me to share some of my experiences. When I first moved here from Riverdale to Stockbridge, I was really sad - I missed my old home and the people there. But my parents wanted the best for my sister and me, so we moved to a new area with better housing and a better school. It was a big change, but over time, I got used to it and made some new friends and even some enemies at school. However, I never really got to know my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis, who lived right next door. They've been like family to me, and I appreciate them a lot. I remember attending Mr. Glen's wedding, and it was an amazing experience - I even caught the little strap from Ms. Veda's leg when she threw it away! We all danced and had a great time, and I'm looking forward to having a similar celebration someday when I'm successful and can give my future wife the life she deserves. I also had a great time with Marsharii, Mr. Glen's daughter, but I haven't seen her since then. I hope she's doing well. Our neighborhood is like a maze, but now that I have a GPS, I can explore it more. I've only gone so far, and most of the time, it's been with my friends Kason and Curtis - we used to love playing video games together and just enjoying life. Sometimes, I'd go to the park and appreciate nature, which really calms me down. It gives me a sense of peace and tranquility. I'd also bring sticks from Home Depot and practice my balance, and I even bring my bokken wooden sword if I can. It's a lot of fun doing what I love. We also have a basketball and tennis court, although I haven't played in a long time - it's nice to have the option to pick it up again if I want to. My dad taught me and my best friend tennis with Mr. Graves, and we always had a great time - they worked us hard, but we always enjoyed it. There are a lot of good memories here, but these are some of the ones that stand out to me, and I think the best times are yet to come!",
            "I'm pretty lucky to be living near the college I attend. It's just a short walk away, so I get to enjoy the convenience. The area's got a mix of apartment buildings and some pretty affordable restaurants and bars that are fun to hang out at. One of the bars just changed its name, and it's a bit pricier, but the service and drinks aren't bad. Most of the people around here are either students like me or lower-income folks, thanks to the affordable housing. There's a lot of families with kids living here because there's an elementary school nearby. To be honest, I don't really know my neighbors, and I'm not really looking to. They're always smoking pot, and the management had to put an air freshener in front of their unit, which my boyfriend and I found hilarious. It's almost like they're taunting us. The building I live in is a bit old, but the interior's been renovated. Down the street, there are some brand new apartments that look nice, but I'm not a fan. They're cheaply made, but the rent's pretty steep, which seems like a rip-off. I think it's because they're close to campus that they can get away with it. There's a super cheap eatery about a 5-minute walk from my place that serves food on paper plates and microwaves most of their meals. Across from that is a gas station that's not a great place to work. However, the city put in some money to redo the road last summer, and now we've got a nice big sidewalk, lots of greenery on the medians and sides of the road, and the area's looking a bit nicer. The apartment building I live in is surrounded by trees, but they cut a few down, so there are some stumps left. There are way more trees here than on the street down the block. Behind my apartment complex, there's a tree line and another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street, and that one's not as nice. The sidewalks are in bad shape, and most of the buildings look run down. There are a lot of trees on this street, but it's probably just to hide how bad the buildings look. Most of the crime around here has happened at an apartment complex on 43rd street, but I'm not gonna blame them entirely. There are apartments across from me with a lot of crime and a pretty transient population. Despite all that, I kinda like living here. It's affordable, and there are plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially love how the university's within walking distance, and there are two bus stops so I can easily get to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood is like a haven. It's made up of identical-looking duplexes on a cul-de-sac, but they feel like individual homes thanks to the unique way they're spaced out. Each one's painted a bright yellow with a white porch and a green metal roof. Most of us are like one big happy family, although we're not all exactly close. You'd often catch us standing at the end of our driveway some evenings, chatting away while the kids play with their toys, draw with sidewalk chalk, or fly their kites. In today's world that's all about technology and machines, it feels like we've stepped back in time. We're surrounded by vast fields, trees, and open skies with big, puffy white clouds. But, this season's been a bit of a mixed bag - we've had tornado warnings and, for the first time, the sirens actually went off last night, so we had to head for shelter. I was crouched in my bathtub, clutching my smallest dog and my purse, along with a few pillows for good measure. My bigger dog refused to join me, instead staying in the living room, barking nervously as he sensed something was off. The neighborhood was eerily quiet, except for the sound of hail pounding the ground. After the storm, the temperature dropped dramatically - we went from 92 to 75 degrees in just a few minutes. The hail melted instantly when it hit the scorching pavement. As the skies cleared, the sun came out and rain started pouring down, followed by a breathtaking double rainbow. I quickly grabbed my camera and snapped some pics to share with my friends and family on Facebook - they were just as amazed as I was. The streets stayed quiet for a bit, then people started trickling back home from wherever they'd been when the storm hit. Once again, it was business as usual - the moms and kids were back out, and the delicious smell of dinner wafted through the air. I've only recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina, and I'm loving the friendly vibe of my new neighborhood. Everyone speaks with that charming Southern accent that's so unique and endearing. Although all the houses look the same from the outside, each apartment's different on the inside - some are surprisingly tiny. It's a bit puzzling, but it doesn't take away from the charm of this place. I adore strolling through the biggest field behind my house and making my way to the pond, which is more of a scenic spot than a swimming hole. I've spotted deer, and in the mornings, you can hear the deep, melodious song of the bullfrog. It's a fantastic place to live, just a 40-minute drive from the city of Charlotte. Every morning starts with the cheerful sound of roosters crowing from the nearby farms - it's like living in a little village all its own. We even have a friendly donkey at a nearby farm that brays in the evening to let us know he's there. I feel lucky to have found this hidden gem of a neighborhood.",
            "I moved into this neighborhood on the eve of starting eighth grade, and it was a bit of a challenge to make friends initially. However, I eventually connected with a friend who lives just two houses down from me and another guy from my street. Although they no longer live here, the memories we shared remain vivid. The familiar faces from when I first moved here are still around, giving the neighborhood a sense of continuity. Our neighborhood bears a striking resemblance to a typical American suburban neighborhood - rows of two-story houses, the sound of kids playing outside on warm days, and an overall quiet atmosphere most of the week. I've never had any issues with my neighbors, and it's not unusual to be left to your own devices unless you need help. Online deliveries are also safe, with no packages ever going missing from my porch. This level of trust is rare, and I appreciate it. The park, just a minute or two away, holds a special place in my heart. I have fond memories of playing basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood. However, it's also where I experienced one of my worst moments - getting elbowed in the nose while playing football. The good memories far outweigh the bad, and whenever I visit the park now, it's to spend time with my cousin's energetic kids. They love the swings and slides, and it brings back nostalgic feelings. The neighborhood is also quite diverse, with a wide range of cuisines available within a one-mile radius. You can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants nearby, but many people now opt for food delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash. The popular fast food joints are always busy, but you can find these in most suburban neighborhoods. There are also plenty of pizza places and diverse stores, including an Indian-owned store for those craving homemade Indian food or ready-made options. Overall, I'm grateful for my neighborhood. Seeing the horror stories of other people's neighborhood experiences on social media and the news makes me appreciate mine even more.",
            "Our little neighborhood in South Carolina is a quaint town that doesn't stand out from the crowd. However, it's made a significant name for itself in the agriculture sector. The town proudly calls itself the Peach Capital of the World, a title that's showcased on its welcoming sign. The town is mostly made up of vast farmlands, with either peach trees or cattle taking over the landscape. Houses outside of the town center are spaced out, with most being two-story homes featuring metal roofs to combat the scorching summer heat or gray shingles. These homes are often located far from the main road, allowing the front fields to be used for animals and crops. The town center, on the other hand, is where you'll find a single four-way stop light and a few stores. There are three fast-food places to choose from: Hong Kong, a small family-run Chinese restaurant; Fiesta Mexican Restaurant; or Gary's, a small burger chain. We used to have a pizzeria, but it closed down not too long ago. There's a small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug, which is surprisingly famous for selling Cherry Coca-Cola. The only grocery store in town is Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, which is a bit pricey. While it's the only option, many people prefer to drive to the Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville to buy most of their groceries. The most popular store in town, however, is Dollar General, which sells a wide range of everyday items and is always bustling from opening to closing time. There's also a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who's well-respected in the community. The store has been around for a long time and even employs movers who'll deliver the furniture to your doorstep. Next to the furniture store is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels, which offers various services like daycare, boarding, grooming, and more. The doctor's and veterinary practices are located outside of the main town area, but they're small and well-equipped to take care of the town's residents. We have a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School, and once kids complete fifth grade, they have to attend middle and high school in the next town over. Although there aren't any parks in town, we're currently building a 2.5-acre recreational area to provide families with more opportunities to spend time together and attract new visitors and residents. Despite its limitations, our town is a lovely place, so small that you could drive through it without even noticing it!",
            "I remember when I first heard about my apartment complex. It was while listening to a podcast about people who went missing, which was quite surprising. Almost every apartment in the area had rent prices over a thousand dollars a month, and I had never heard about that story or any of my friends had. It might be the harsh reality of life. I've seen some friends of mine cry themselves to sleep at night, struggling to make ends meet. Despite the high costs of living, we've learned to adapt and live with less. You start to grow fond of the musty smell of second-hand toys and old, stored clothes. It's different from the smell of adulthood, which is more like dusty magazines stacked on a dusty piano. The smell seeps into the leather and remains even after you clean it. There are three thrift stores within walking distance from my place. Starting from the far end, you can visit two charity thrift stores, a library, a rare bookshop, and a curio shop. Even though the streets are bustling with cars and people, the thrift stores are surprisingly quiet. It's a great spot to spend an afternoon. Every year, the city becomes more crowded, with more cars and people swarming in. They say it's a developing city, with one of the largest e-commerce and delivery empires headquartered here, but it still shows signs of growing pains. It reminds me of New York, where everyone is focused on their goals, and no one really asks for much from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you be. It's quite different from the South, where being a bit concerned about someone means you genuinely care. Here, you can keep to yourself and the city will just move on like the waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be, with the pianist next door and the two amateur singers upstairs always adding to the atmosphere. In a way, we're not just apartment-mates, but a community of friends who come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other out. I'm lucky to live here, and I really like most of my neighbors. They treat me well, and I try to reciprocate by keeping my space clean and leaving them little gifts. It's nice to see them and I think they enjoy my company just as much as I do theirs. Despite living in a massive, impersonal modernist complex, it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally mess up my life.",
            "The place I live in is pretty much like any other cookie-cutter suburbia. The streets seem to blend together, but my neighborhood sticks out thanks to its strict homeowner's association. As you drive in, you'll see rows of tidy single-family homes that all have the same vibe. Each front yard has a nicely manicured lawn, some decorative pebbles, and a short driveway. You might even spot a small tree or two here and there. Everyone has a two-car garage, and the roads are always well-maintained, with no potholes in sight. Most houses are one-story, but you'll sometimes see two-story ones too. One thing that's a bit different is the way we get our mail. Instead of individual mailboxes in front of each house, we have a big cluster of mailboxes at the end of the street that we access with a key. There are also two larger lockers for packages, thanks to the HOA's love of uniformity. My house is situated right at the edge of the city, so our neighborhood feels like a mix of rural and suburban. We have a lot of space for everything, which is great for outdoor activities. There's a well-maintained community pool that's gated and accessible to anyone living here. We also have walking trails where you can take your dog for a walk or go for a solo evening stroll. You don't need to visit a park to get some exercise – just walk around the neighborhood and you'll get a good workout. The community is mostly made up of retirees, but we also have some middle-aged and young professionals. The area is super safe, and everyone looks out for each other. When it comes to the city, it's surprisingly big in terms of population, but it still has a small-town feel. We've got all the amenities you'd expect, from a mall to high-end grocery stores and bargain outlets. It takes me about 15 minutes to drive to anywhere significant, but once you get there, you've got a ton of stores to choose from. We've got everything from fancy organic food stores to budget-friendly outlets with minimal staff. All in all, my neighborhood is a great place to live – it's safe, well-maintained, and has plenty of nice features like pools and walking trails. Just hop in your car and you're off to any major store you want.",
            "Yesterday, I reflected on my life in this small Midwestern town. It's situated on the outskirts of a major city, with a suburban area nearby. My neighborhood is located on the east side, and it's been described as the economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are generally low here, and most homes are either rented out or owned by low-income families. However, it's not a run-down or unpleasant place. My neighbors are friendly folks who greet me warmly whenever I walk down the street. Crime rates might be slightly higher than other parts of town, but we still manage to keep it under control. There have been a few violent incidents in the past decade, including some shootings and a homicide. A family we know personally lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Luckily, we haven't been directly affected by crime, except for the occasional missing item from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. My town has been severely impacted by the opioid epidemic that's been plaguing the country. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses, and it's been a challenge for us to cope with it. However, we have a few resources available to combat this issue, such as rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those struggling with addiction. Despite the challenges, my town has its positives. The elementary school my son attends has an excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. My son has special needs, but he's never faced bullying due to the positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that organizes various events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. The school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child has to go hungry. We have a zero-tolerance policy towards anyone feeling less than due to financial constraints, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made significant improvements to the town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side, where I live, tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for my neighbors and me. Despite this, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options to meet our needs, and although our home may not be worth much, it's comfortable and suitable for us. We've lived here for over 16 years, and I couldn't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is a melting pot of cultures, nestled on a hill surrounded by historic buildings that reflect its rich heritage. My apartment, a 7-story high-rise, faces the old theater, while just a block away, an arcade bar is the hotspot for people from all walks of life on warm summer nights. During June and July weekends, you'll often spot a line of people waiting to get in. The nearby city park is a tranquil oasis, with its expansive size considering its location. Concrete walls with stairs encircle the park, providing a sense of security. During the harsh winter months, homeless individuals set up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and steps, taking advantage of the proximity to the city's only family center, where they can access basic amenities like bathing and showering facilities. What I appreciate most about my city, though, isn't its picturesque architecture or historic landmarks. It's the people themselves who make this place special. You see, Hilltop once had a notorious reputation for gang violence, with stories of federal officials and the DEA sweeping in to clean up the streets still being passed down through generations. Despite its rough reputation, the community has worked hard to keep the area clean and cared for. They take pride in their city and neighborhood, as evident in the way they look out for one another. Some say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill at night, a warning that still lingers from the past and is tainted with social conditioning. I believe this warning is a reminder of the racism and assumptions that plague our nation, even in a city that prides itself as a melting pot. I'm grateful to be part of this community, where I've experienced kindness and generosity from strangers. Walking the streets at night, I've been offered jackets, phone charges, and words of encouragement from people who have seen beyond my skin color. It's a place where I feel at home, where I'm reminded that I'm valued and beautiful, even on the darkest of nights.",
            "I reside in a small town in rural America, specifically in Michigan, where the landscape transitions seamlessly from farmland to quaint tourist towns. You won't find massive shopping malls like Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee's here. Every time I need to go somewhere, I have to hit the road. But despite this, I live in one of the most breathtaking locations in the world, surrounded by water. My town is flanked by two incredible lakes: the majestic Lake Michigan and the serene Lake Charlevoix. Every spot you visit has its own little beach, inviting you to dip your toes in the cool waters. My neighborhood perfectly encapsulates the essence of a small town. The houses are not stacked haphazardly on top of one another; instead, they're unique, older homes that have been lovingly restored or updated. Many of the houses have basements that are visible from the street, and they're often adorned with beautiful, weathered aluminum siding. The neighborhood is a kaleidoscope of colors, with houses of every hue and style that surround my home. Most of the houses have spacious yards, complete with trampolines, playsets, and sometimes even gardens and fences for pets. The overall atmosphere is quintessentially Midwestern: hardworking people, families, and a strong sense of community. On any given day, you'll see kids running freely through the streets, people walking their dogs, biking, or rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors, and it's easy to spot those who are new to the area. You'll often see someone grilling outside and waving, or a neighbor from a few blocks away walking their dog and smiling warmly. The lawns are meticulously maintained, with neatly cut grass and tidy gardens. It's not a neighborhood that's going to leave you awestruck with its grandeur, but it's a place that exudes a sense of comfort, peace, and safety. Within walking distance, you'll find the county sheriff's department, the health department, and the city recycling center, which serves the community with valuable services. The nearby baseball and softball fields are always bustling with activity, and the sound of announcers calling out player names and keeping score is a familiar soundtrack to our town. Our small town airport is also nearby, adding to the lively atmosphere. You can easily walk to the local ice cream shop or bike to the park, which is just a few blocks away. It's an ideal place to call home."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "My city is a melting pot, with a diverse range of communities living together in the same area. Residential areas seem to pop up randomly alongside shops, restaurants, and entertainment spots, creating a lively atmosphere. Everywhere you look, there are new eateries to try and stores to explore. While some of these stores are big-name brands, others are smaller, independent boutiques that line the streets and are often within walking distance from quiet neighborhoods. The place is also dotted with nearby parks, which are always bustling with families with young kids. When it comes to the people, my neighborhood is a true microcosm of the world, with a thriving LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a significant number of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union all living in the same area. If you venture a bit further out, you'll find even more diverse communities, each with their own little enclaves, such as Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia. However, these areas are only a stone's throw away, yet the traffic can be a nightmare, especially during rush hour, when a 10-mile journey can take two hours. It's not surprising that hardly anyone walks anywhere, given the sheer size of the city and the congested roads. The result is some of the worst traffic in the world, and finding parking spots can be a real challenge. Paradoxically, the city has seen a lot of construction in recent years, with new apartment buildings sprouting up left and right. While this might make it a popular destination, many residents are worried about the influx of new people and the subsequent increase in traffic. When it comes to housing, there's a wide range of options to choose from, from large apartment buildings to single-family homes, duplexes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Even within my immediate neighborhood, I've noticed a diverse range of housing options, and the people who live here are just as varied, with different ages and backgrounds. While it's not a tight-knit community like it used to be, I still have fond memories of playing with my next-door neighbor and a few other friends from the neighborhood when I was younger.",
            "My neighborhood's got character. The majority of the houses are standalone family homes, but you'll find a few that have been split into two, still connected, if that makes sense. My place has a small front yard and a driveway to the left, much like the ones surrounding it. It's like stepping back in time, a reminder of when suburban living was the quintessential American dream. Although that dream seems to be fading away, my neighborhood and many others still hold on to it, a beacon of what once was. The people here aren't as optimistic as they used to be, the upkeep's not what it used to be, but there's still a car or two in every driveway, and the youth still play like the world revolves around them. The old public school, which has been here for nearly 90 years, still stands, still symbolizing a future for the young and stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are scarce and mostly empty, but the basketball courts are always packed. The homes may look different, but they feel the same. There's a large supermarket called Super A, owned by a big Yemeni family, who just so happen to be the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The majority of residents are African American. The streets are wide, and kids usually play football, only stopping for cars to pass. Most of the people here have been here for generations, and many can tell stories of a time when everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school, but after the karate movies stopped being popular, the kids lost interest, and it's now a pharmacy. I guess some people think that taking medicine makes everything better, although I'm not so sure. We also have a small movie theater that screens old films at a discounted price. The youth aren't too interested, but the older folks love it as a cheap way to get out for a night, minus the kids, of course. We have an expressway running through our town, but the entrance and exit are actually in the neighboring town. There was a petition to get an exit in our town, but the youth supported it, while the older folks were against it, claiming it would ruin the town. In the end, they convinced the city council to deny the request. We're building a new high school, and we're trying to decide on a mascot for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the best representation of our town.",
            "At first glance, it may seem unassuming, tucked away behind a strip of shops - not the kind of place you'd expect to find homes, let alone thriving communities. But venture behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk past the hotels that sit vacant most of the year, except for the occasional summer family gathering, and you'll stumble upon a hidden gem. This otherwise unassuming area is actually home to a bustling neighborhood, where apartment complexes line the streets like intricately arranged building blocks.\n\nOne of these complexes has made headlines for some unsavory dealings, but we'll leave that aside for now - appearances can be deceiving. The apartments beside it, and the ones beside those, tell a different story - one that's largely unknown to those living in the area. Across from these complexes is a community college's branch campus, a quiet cluster of buildings standing watch over the road. Students filter in, sipping coffee and yawning as they start their day at 7 am, while commuters behind them grumble at the traffic congestion.\n\nThe road intersects with another residential street, lined with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for those with broken bones. The treatment center boasts cheerful outdoor furniture and a lazily spinning ceiling fan, stirring the hot summer air. Kids run freely in the park, doing somersaults and twirling in the grass as bees lazily flit between the flowers. Retirees walk their dogs on the walking path, shooting disapproving glances at the teenagers on skateboards and nodding politely at the cluster of teenage girls gossiping by the playground.\n\nA strip mall nearby houses a sushi restaurant with affordable food, a swimming supply store, and a nail salon. You can fill up your pool and get a manicure at the same time - the perfect combination of convenience and relaxation. There's also a DIY frozen yogurt shop, where teens often grab cups of cold, dripping yogurt and toppings while they skateboard and vape, thinking they're the coolest. This neighborhood is a quintessential slice of Americana, a time capsule in the quiet south where time seems to stand still.",
            "As we drove past the endless cornfields that filled the horizon, she asked, \"Where are we?\" I knew she'd be surprised by the vast open space. She was from a town where the convenience store was just a 5-minute walk from her house, and she'd never seen so much emptiness. I shared with her what it's like growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood where I came from. The road unwinds like a ribbon through a sea of corn, accompanied by a quarry that's home to a calm lake. Just beyond it lies my home in a small development where houses stand proudly with their brick and stucco facades. Each house boasts at least half an acre of land, which we all take great pride in maintaining. Every spring, the landscape transforms with an explosion of colorful flowers and trees that change colors with each passing season. The driveways are lined with sleek Mercedes-Benz luxury cars, glistening in the sunlight after a refreshing wash. As we continue down the road, my grey stucco home comes into view, and you'll likely catch a glimpse of my friendly Korean neighbor, always tending to his lawn with a warm smile. He spends his days mowing the grass and singing over the hum of his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Everyone in the neighborhood adores him, but beneath his friendly demeanor lies a rich history - he was once a doctor and has lost some of his wit as the years have passed. He blends in with the grass and his trusty mower, a sight that brings smiles to our faces. Eventually, you'll reach my house, where geese roam freely in the side yard, chased by our energetic Terrier. Behind my home lies a tranquil stream that feeds into the quarry, accompanied by the soothing sounds of bullfrogs, the gentle flow of the stream, and the occasional \"moo\" from the nearby farms. Across the rustic wooden bridge lies an untouched haven, teeming with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was where I spent most of my childhood, creating memories with friends and siblings - building tree forts, chasing after wild animals (or at least, trying to!), and enjoying the simple joys of childhood. Our winters can be harsh, but there's nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a lush green landscape to a barren wilderness, with the once-vibrant flowers and trees standing as skeletal reminders of the changing seasons. And when snow falls, a winter wonderland appears overnight, complete with snow angels made by my little sister and snowmen that stand guard over our little domain. My sister and I may have fought often as kids, but during the winter, snowballs were our trusty companions, and our backyard transformed into an arsenal of forts and branches. In our own little world, we were carefree kids, living in a winter wonderland where nothing else mattered.",
            "To truly grasp the essence of Portland, Oregon, you need to grasp the concept of \"weird\". The unofficial town motto, scribbled on the back of a building that's a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and a little bit of a lawbreaker, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". Some see this as a nostalgic call to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's - a place that was lesser-known, more affordable, and gave rise to unique and innovative subcultures. Others see it as an invitation - come to Portland, where you'll still be called weird, but this time as a compliment. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the constant construction of condominiums for these Californians, Portland remains weird. Being weird doesn't mean we're always accepting, but it means we accept things that others wouldn't normally accept. Weird doesn't mean we're devoid of modern conveniences and modern struggles. Like everywhere else, we buy most of our goods from China. Being weird comes in a million forms, a million ways of being not normal, but Portland's got plenty of normal too. Portland has yoga, hipsters, and business professionals. Maybe being weird just means we take all this less seriously. In my neighborhood, like many Portland neighborhoods, the streets are lined with colorful houses, home gardens bursting with flowers, herbs, and vegetables, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are essentially cardboard containers or plastic bags with unwanted items, but sometimes you'll stumble upon something magical - a treasure tailored to the person wandering by. Free boxes can contain anything from clothes and books to anything else you can imagine. The thrill of strolling through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about, from my perspective, but I'm just one of the thousands of weird Portlanders. Some people I live among wouldn't dare pick through the contents of a box on the sidewalk. They'd rather attend goat yoga (yes, yoga with live goats) or a Timbers match (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things and pursue their passions, or at least dream about pursuing them, while having one too many drinks at the bar. Unfortunately, Portland also has a drug problem, which stems from underlying mental health issues, and the constant drizzle and cloudy skies might be contributing to it. The city also struggles with homelessness, and no one seems to know the solution. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, which are better than in most parts of the country, but they're still insufficient. The non-homeless population is torn between compassion and disdain. In this, we're not weird at all.",
            "The mountains stand tall and unyielding in the north, their presence a constant reminder of the passage of time as the sun rises and sets. Their solidity is unwavering, unchanging despite my preoccupation with life's everyday struggles. It's as if they silently demand my attention on the most trying days, offering me a chance to temporarily lay my anxious thoughts to rest and find solace in their unshakeable strength. My journey here started when I first began my university studies, and it was the mountains north of campus that initially drew me in. While the university itself boasts its own share of breathtaking scenery, from buildings to ponds and trees that have a piece of my heart, the mountains hold a special place. The town is lovely in its own right, with its charming cafés where I've spent countless hours fueled by coffee and cram sessions. A short walk or bus ride takes me to the downtown area, where the faded bricks of old buildings envelop me in a sense of history and antiquity. The contrast between this laid-back atmosphere and the bustling urban city nearby is a big part of what makes this town so endearing. This dichotomy of worlds existing side by side makes it easy to create lasting memories, each tied to a specific part of town. Whether it's strolling past the rusted swings in the park after a long night of studying or racing through the downtown streets to catch a movie at the cinema, every moment is a treasure. However, as with any place, there are also memories that are harder to cherish, memories that remind us of life's complexities. The ponds, in particular, can be a poignant place for reflection and introspection, especially during those late-night existential crises when the world seems overwhelming. As I wander past the pond, the park, and the quaint houses that remind me of the comforts of suburbia, I find myself drawn towards the main street. It's there, under the golden glow of the sunrise painting the sky, that I catch sight of the mountains in all their glory. Their stature and presence are a constant reminder of my own strength and perseverance, and in that moment, I am reminded of the importance of staying the course.",
            "If you're planning a trip to Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you won't have a hard time finding it - public transport is easy to access and a super popular mode of transport in New York City. Bensonhurt's a fairly urban area, so you'll still get that New York City vibe. When you're there, get ready to see loads of Asian stores around every corner. Over the years, Bensonhurt's become a hotspot for Asians, and you'll notice an Asian-owned store every few blocks as you walk around. Supermarkets and laundromats are the most popular ones - they're super convenient, with great food quality, super cheap prices, and super efficient services. Just around my place, there are four Asian supermarkets within a 2-minute walk from each other - talk about convenience! Now, don't get me wrong, Bensonhurt's not all Asian - it's super diverse, with immigrants and their American-born kids living here. Most of the big businesses in the area are Asian-owned, but you'll also find a renovated park nearby with loads of facilities - 10 basketball courts, a big field for soccer or baseball, 4 handball courts, swings, a kids' playground, and even a water fountain for the summer. Since we're in New York City, you'll see a mix of everything here - all sorts of people getting along just fine. Unlike the city's corporate buildings, Bensonhurt's mostly got co-op living and condo apartments, with a few two-family houses here and there. The people are generally nice, but be prepared for some noise pollution - you'll hear cars blasting music and speeding by, and some folks can be a bit rowdy. If you're visiting at night, just be aware of your surroundings - the area's generally safe, but you never know when you might run into someone causing trouble. I've had my share of run-ins with troublemakers in the past, so be cautious. Plus, keep an eye out for package thieves - they're a thing here. One last thing - people don't always follow the rules about cleaning up after their dogs, so be prepared to see dog waste on the streets. My biggest pet peeve? Dog waste everywhere I go - keep your shoes clean and watch where you step!",
            "Living in my area, I've come to realize that sidewalks are a rare sight. We have a really steep hill in our neighborhood, often referred to as the \"workout hill\" due to the numerous joggers who use it as part of their daily routine. With no sidewalks on my street, pedestrians are forced to walk on the road, which can be hazardous due to the potholes and uneven surface. Our road is also lined with worn-out telephone and electric wires that look like they're on their last leg. The frequent storms and heavy rainfall in our area often cause branches and debris to knock down the power lines, leading to a patchwork of repairs. The scene is dominated by tall evergreen trees, but strangely, people here tend to see them as a nuisance, cutting them down to get a clear view of the ocean. Many houses are built high up on the hill, with expansive glass windows to take in the breathtaking view of the bay. It's truly stunning during sunset, when the water below seems to glow and the sky turns a vibrant orange. However, this sight is often obstructed by the overcast skies that prevail most days, casting a haze over the scenery. As a result, moss grows abundantly on everything it can find - roofs, cars, and railings alike. I once left my car parked for a month, and when I returned, it was covered in a thick layer of moss that took three hours to remove. Our neighborhood is home to a few schools, but it's mostly populated by older folks, many of whom have retired. Dogs are a common sight, with many owners letting them roam freely in their lawns or racing them down the street. Be careful not to leave your door or window open, or you might find a curious canine sneaking in. I once found one lounging in my living room, and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits also run wild in our area, and while some are quite large, they're a nuisance to gardeners who see them digging up plants and burrowing into lawns. My cats, on the other hand, seem to enjoy the thrill of the hunt, and have managed to drive most of them out of our neighborhood. We also have a variety of birds, including small sparrows and hummingbirds, as well as the occasional hawk or eagle that swoops by until the crows chase it off. While there are no stores nearby, a short hike down to the waterfront reveals a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. The beach itself isn't impressive, but the rocks along the shore make for a fun spot to skip stones into the water. The bay is relatively narrow, and on most days, you can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist.",
            "Me and my family, my wife and two daughters, ages 11 and 14, live in a typical suburban area in a small town in Tennessee. Our street is like a main artery connecting two state highways, which means we get more traffic than we'd like, but overall it's a peaceful neighborhood. Not many people move in or out, so I'm familiar with most of the folks around here. Everyone keeps busy with yard work and daily chores. In the winters, we enjoy sledding down a hill on our side street, right at the front corner of our street where our house is located. We see everything that's going on from our house since it's a central spot on the street. When we see a strange car, we take note of it. Some neighbors go for walks or walk their dogs, while the kids ride their bikes. With us working from home, we're often around. It's just the four of us, so I'd say our neighbors are used to seeing us come and go. We like to get outside, even on rainy days. Sometimes we grill on our back deck, and the smell of barbecue is always a delight. There's always someone cutting grass around here, so we hear lawn mowers almost daily from March to October, when the grass slows down. Our neighborhood was originally wooded, so we have plenty of trees, providing shade but also a lot of leaves in the fall, which means raking and burning them every year. I love the smell of burning leaves, signaling the start of fall. Lately, we haven't been experiencing much winter, so it just feels like an extended fall. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we usually use the back door, unless someone knocks on the front door, which is rare. When I'm working on my truck or projects in the garage with the doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, things get pretty quiet around here. We get some visitors from out of town on Thanksgiving and other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas, which brings more cars around. Overall, I really like living here. If it weren't for the through street, it'd be perfect.",
            "I live in a neighborhood smack in the middle of the high desert, surrounded by dirt and nothing much else. Unless you've experienced living here, you can't really grasp the feeling of seeing brown everywhere you look. If you do come across a lawn, you know that person is shelling out a fortune on lawn care. When I first moved here in the 90s, houses were spread out, but it wasn't as crowded as it is now. There are a lot more people and new additions, making the area look more and more like a city every day. Most places are changing the same way, I guess. The people here are generally friendly, but like any city, you've got your ups and downs. I'm lucky to live in a pretty nice neighborhood surrounded by friendly old folks. The shops around here are mostly chain stores like Food for Less and Smart and Final. If you want to go organic, you'll have to travel a bit. I rarely see any Whole Foods or similar stores around. The dominant profession in our city, from what I've observed, is construction. I think it's because our city is still pretty undeveloped, leaving plenty of wide open spaces to build on. To be honest, that scares me a bit - I prefer things the way they are. I left a big city behind, and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction, that's the field where I work full-time as a drywall and T-bar installer. What I love about my home is the variety of animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, including its stark beauty. The unique high desert climate and topography create challenging ecosystems that need our protection and are home to diverse wildlife. As a resident, it's essential to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment with us, so we can coexist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted well to the local wildlife. My three kids are obsessed with lizards and desert bugs, and as I write this, they're outside trying to catch different specimens. As for attractions, we have a few. Victorville is a great place for families to experience the desert, offering a unique experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with the annual San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will add a great mix of activities and fun to your visit, showcasing the Victorville way. Head to nearby Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to cap off your visit. If you're interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem, check out the Victor Valley Museum, which features geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of Victorville's development and industry.",
            "Hmmm...when people ask me to describe my neighborhood, my answer's gonna be pretty different, I'm sure. Most others who answer this question are probably homeowners living their own lives, but I'm a bit of an exception. My neighborhood's actually the college campus I live on, and my dorm-mates are basically my community. The surrounding campus is also part of my neighborhood, but to a lesser extent. Despite being a bit unusual, my neighborhood shares some similarities with the usual ideas about neighborhoods. Like any typical neighborhood, my campus has houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's start with the 'houses' in my neighborhood. By the way, there are three types of housing here – apartments, normal houses, and dormitories. First, in the apartments, each room usually has 2-4 people, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. Each building can have about 2 floors, so that's around 20 people living in each one. Second, there are normal houses that are available for school affiliates to rent – usually 2-4 bedrooms. However, they're quite rare, as they're not the most efficient option. Lastly, there are the typical dorm rooms where hundreds of students live, usually 2 people sharing a room, except in some cases. These are the most common type of housing here. Now that we've covered housing, let's move on to the people. My school's all about diversity, and this is reflected in the neighborhood. We have people from all sorts of cultures and ages living here. The professionals usually stay in the houses, while the new students live in the dorms and the older students live in apartments. Talking about the people here is a bit hard to sum up, so let's just move on to the stores and parks. Since my school is pretty much its own neighborhood, it has plenty of stores and a single park. The stores have a mix of dining options and the school's unique clothing and grocery stores. You can pretty much find everything you need within the neighborhood. The park's a playground for all the diverse people here, kept clean and crime-free by everyone in the neighborhood.",
            "I've been living in this neighborhood for almost 10 years now, and I think it's time for me to share some of my experiences. When I first moved here from Riverdale to Stockbridge, I was really sad - I missed my old home and the people there. But my parents wanted the best for my sister and me, so we moved to a new area with better housing and a better school. It was a big change, but over time, I got used to it and made some new friends and even some enemies at school. However, I never really got to know my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis, who lived right next door. They've been like family to me, and I appreciate them a lot. I remember attending Mr. Glen's wedding, and it was an amazing experience - I even caught the little strap from Ms. Veda's leg when she threw it away! We all danced and had a great time, and I'm looking forward to having a similar celebration someday when I'm successful and can give my future wife the life she deserves. I also had a great time with Marsharii, Mr. Glen's daughter, but I haven't seen her since then. I hope she's doing well. Our neighborhood is like a maze, but now that I have a GPS, I can explore it more. I've only gone so far, and most of the time, it's been with my friends Kason and Curtis - we used to love playing video games together and just enjoying life. Sometimes, I'd go to the park and appreciate nature, which really calms me down. It gives me a sense of peace and tranquility. I'd also bring sticks from Home Depot and practice my balance, and I even bring my bokken wooden sword if I can. It's a lot of fun doing what I love. We also have a basketball and tennis court, although I haven't played in a long time - it's nice to have the option to pick it up again if I want to. My dad taught me and my best friend tennis with Mr. Graves, and we always had a great time - they worked us hard, but we always enjoyed it. There are a lot of good memories here, but these are some of the ones that stand out to me, and I think the best times are yet to come!",
            "I'm pretty lucky to be living near the college I attend. It's just a short walk away, so I get to enjoy the convenience. The area's got a mix of apartment buildings and some pretty affordable restaurants and bars that are fun to hang out at. One of the bars just changed its name, and it's a bit pricier, but the service and drinks aren't bad. Most of the people around here are either students like me or lower-income folks, thanks to the affordable housing. There's a lot of families with kids living here because there's an elementary school nearby. To be honest, I don't really know my neighbors, and I'm not really looking to. They're always smoking pot, and the management had to put an air freshener in front of their unit, which my boyfriend and I found hilarious. It's almost like they're taunting us. The building I live in is a bit old, but the interior's been renovated. Down the street, there are some brand new apartments that look nice, but I'm not a fan. They're cheaply made, but the rent's pretty steep, which seems like a rip-off. I think it's because they're close to campus that they can get away with it. There's a super cheap eatery about a 5-minute walk from my place that serves food on paper plates and microwaves most of their meals. Across from that is a gas station that's not a great place to work. However, the city put in some money to redo the road last summer, and now we've got a nice big sidewalk, lots of greenery on the medians and sides of the road, and the area's looking a bit nicer. The apartment building I live in is surrounded by trees, but they cut a few down, so there are some stumps left. There are way more trees here than on the street down the block. Behind my apartment complex, there's a tree line and another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street, and that one's not as nice. The sidewalks are in bad shape, and most of the buildings look run down. There are a lot of trees on this street, but it's probably just to hide how bad the buildings look. Most of the crime around here has happened at an apartment complex on 43rd street, but I'm not gonna blame them entirely. There are apartments across from me with a lot of crime and a pretty transient population. Despite all that, I kinda like living here. It's affordable, and there are plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially love how the university's within walking distance, and there are two bus stops so I can easily get to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood is like a haven. It's made up of identical-looking duplexes on a cul-de-sac, but they feel like individual homes thanks to the unique way they're spaced out. Each one's painted a bright yellow with a white porch and a green metal roof. Most of us are like one big happy family, although we're not all exactly close. You'd often catch us standing at the end of our driveway some evenings, chatting away while the kids play with their toys, draw with sidewalk chalk, or fly their kites. In today's world that's all about technology and machines, it feels like we've stepped back in time. We're surrounded by vast fields, trees, and open skies with big, puffy white clouds. But, this season's been a bit of a mixed bag - we've had tornado warnings and, for the first time, the sirens actually went off last night, so we had to head for shelter. I was crouched in my bathtub, clutching my smallest dog and my purse, along with a few pillows for good measure. My bigger dog refused to join me, instead staying in the living room, barking nervously as he sensed something was off. The neighborhood was eerily quiet, except for the sound of hail pounding the ground. After the storm, the temperature dropped dramatically - we went from 92 to 75 degrees in just a few minutes. The hail melted instantly when it hit the scorching pavement. As the skies cleared, the sun came out and rain started pouring down, followed by a breathtaking double rainbow. I quickly grabbed my camera and snapped some pics to share with my friends and family on Facebook - they were just as amazed as I was. The streets stayed quiet for a bit, then people started trickling back home from wherever they'd been when the storm hit. Once again, it was business as usual - the moms and kids were back out, and the delicious smell of dinner wafted through the air. I've only recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina, and I'm loving the friendly vibe of my new neighborhood. Everyone speaks with that charming Southern accent that's so unique and endearing. Although all the houses look the same from the outside, each apartment's different on the inside - some are surprisingly tiny. It's a bit puzzling, but it doesn't take away from the charm of this place. I adore strolling through the biggest field behind my house and making my way to the pond, which is more of a scenic spot than a swimming hole. I've spotted deer, and in the mornings, you can hear the deep, melodious song of the bullfrog. It's a fantastic place to live, just a 40-minute drive from the city of Charlotte. Every morning starts with the cheerful sound of roosters crowing from the nearby farms - it's like living in a little village all its own. We even have a friendly donkey at a nearby farm that brays in the evening to let us know he's there. I feel lucky to have found this hidden gem of a neighborhood.",
            "I moved into this neighborhood on the eve of starting eighth grade, and it was a bit of a challenge to make friends initially. However, I eventually connected with a friend who lives just two houses down from me and another guy from my street. Although they no longer live here, the memories we shared remain vivid. The familiar faces from when I first moved here are still around, giving the neighborhood a sense of continuity. Our neighborhood bears a striking resemblance to a typical American suburban neighborhood - rows of two-story houses, the sound of kids playing outside on warm days, and an overall quiet atmosphere most of the week. I've never had any issues with my neighbors, and it's not unusual to be left to your own devices unless you need help. Online deliveries are also safe, with no packages ever going missing from my porch. This level of trust is rare, and I appreciate it. The park, just a minute or two away, holds a special place in my heart. I have fond memories of playing basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood. However, it's also where I experienced one of my worst moments - getting elbowed in the nose while playing football. The good memories far outweigh the bad, and whenever I visit the park now, it's to spend time with my cousin's energetic kids. They love the swings and slides, and it brings back nostalgic feelings. The neighborhood is also quite diverse, with a wide range of cuisines available within a one-mile radius. You can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants nearby, but many people now opt for food delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash. The popular fast food joints are always busy, but you can find these in most suburban neighborhoods. There are also plenty of pizza places and diverse stores, including an Indian-owned store for those craving homemade Indian food or ready-made options. Overall, I'm grateful for my neighborhood. Seeing the horror stories of other people's neighborhood experiences on social media and the news makes me appreciate mine even more.",
            "Our little neighborhood in South Carolina is a quaint town that doesn't stand out from the crowd. However, it's made a significant name for itself in the agriculture sector. The town proudly calls itself the Peach Capital of the World, a title that's showcased on its welcoming sign. The town is mostly made up of vast farmlands, with either peach trees or cattle taking over the landscape. Houses outside of the town center are spaced out, with most being two-story homes featuring metal roofs to combat the scorching summer heat or gray shingles. These homes are often located far from the main road, allowing the front fields to be used for animals and crops. The town center, on the other hand, is where you'll find a single four-way stop light and a few stores. There are three fast-food places to choose from: Hong Kong, a small family-run Chinese restaurant; Fiesta Mexican Restaurant; or Gary's, a small burger chain. We used to have a pizzeria, but it closed down not too long ago. There's a small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug, which is surprisingly famous for selling Cherry Coca-Cola. The only grocery store in town is Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, which is a bit pricey. While it's the only option, many people prefer to drive to the Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville to buy most of their groceries. The most popular store in town, however, is Dollar General, which sells a wide range of everyday items and is always bustling from opening to closing time. There's also a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who's well-respected in the community. The store has been around for a long time and even employs movers who'll deliver the furniture to your doorstep. Next to the furniture store is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels, which offers various services like daycare, boarding, grooming, and more. The doctor's and veterinary practices are located outside of the main town area, but they're small and well-equipped to take care of the town's residents. We have a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School, and once kids complete fifth grade, they have to attend middle and high school in the next town over. Although there aren't any parks in town, we're currently building a 2.5-acre recreational area to provide families with more opportunities to spend time together and attract new visitors and residents. Despite its limitations, our town is a lovely place, so small that you could drive through it without even noticing it!",
            "I remember when I first heard about my apartment complex. It was while listening to a podcast about people who went missing, which was quite surprising. Almost every apartment in the area had rent prices over a thousand dollars a month, and I had never heard about that story or any of my friends had. It might be the harsh reality of life. I've seen some friends of mine cry themselves to sleep at night, struggling to make ends meet. Despite the high costs of living, we've learned to adapt and live with less. You start to grow fond of the musty smell of second-hand toys and old, stored clothes. It's different from the smell of adulthood, which is more like dusty magazines stacked on a dusty piano. The smell seeps into the leather and remains even after you clean it. There are three thrift stores within walking distance from my place. Starting from the far end, you can visit two charity thrift stores, a library, a rare bookshop, and a curio shop. Even though the streets are bustling with cars and people, the thrift stores are surprisingly quiet. It's a great spot to spend an afternoon. Every year, the city becomes more crowded, with more cars and people swarming in. They say it's a developing city, with one of the largest e-commerce and delivery empires headquartered here, but it still shows signs of growing pains. It reminds me of New York, where everyone is focused on their goals, and no one really asks for much from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you be. It's quite different from the South, where being a bit concerned about someone means you genuinely care. Here, you can keep to yourself and the city will just move on like the waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be, with the pianist next door and the two amateur singers upstairs always adding to the atmosphere. In a way, we're not just apartment-mates, but a community of friends who come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other out. I'm lucky to live here, and I really like most of my neighbors. They treat me well, and I try to reciprocate by keeping my space clean and leaving them little gifts. It's nice to see them and I think they enjoy my company just as much as I do theirs. Despite living in a massive, impersonal modernist complex, it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally mess up my life.",
            "The place I live in is pretty much like any other cookie-cutter suburbia. The streets seem to blend together, but my neighborhood sticks out thanks to its strict homeowner's association. As you drive in, you'll see rows of tidy single-family homes that all have the same vibe. Each front yard has a nicely manicured lawn, some decorative pebbles, and a short driveway. You might even spot a small tree or two here and there. Everyone has a two-car garage, and the roads are always well-maintained, with no potholes in sight. Most houses are one-story, but you'll sometimes see two-story ones too. One thing that's a bit different is the way we get our mail. Instead of individual mailboxes in front of each house, we have a big cluster of mailboxes at the end of the street that we access with a key. There are also two larger lockers for packages, thanks to the HOA's love of uniformity. My house is situated right at the edge of the city, so our neighborhood feels like a mix of rural and suburban. We have a lot of space for everything, which is great for outdoor activities. There's a well-maintained community pool that's gated and accessible to anyone living here. We also have walking trails where you can take your dog for a walk or go for a solo evening stroll. You don't need to visit a park to get some exercise – just walk around the neighborhood and you'll get a good workout. The community is mostly made up of retirees, but we also have some middle-aged and young professionals. The area is super safe, and everyone looks out for each other. When it comes to the city, it's surprisingly big in terms of population, but it still has a small-town feel. We've got all the amenities you'd expect, from a mall to high-end grocery stores and bargain outlets. It takes me about 15 minutes to drive to anywhere significant, but once you get there, you've got a ton of stores to choose from. We've got everything from fancy organic food stores to budget-friendly outlets with minimal staff. All in all, my neighborhood is a great place to live – it's safe, well-maintained, and has plenty of nice features like pools and walking trails. Just hop in your car and you're off to any major store you want.",
            "Yesterday, I reflected on my life in this small Midwestern town. It's situated on the outskirts of a major city, with a suburban area nearby. My neighborhood is located on the east side, and it's been described as the economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are generally low here, and most homes are either rented out or owned by low-income families. However, it's not a run-down or unpleasant place. My neighbors are friendly folks who greet me warmly whenever I walk down the street. Crime rates might be slightly higher than other parts of town, but we still manage to keep it under control. There have been a few violent incidents in the past decade, including some shootings and a homicide. A family we know personally lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Luckily, we haven't been directly affected by crime, except for the occasional missing item from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. My town has been severely impacted by the opioid epidemic that's been plaguing the country. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses, and it's been a challenge for us to cope with it. However, we have a few resources available to combat this issue, such as rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those struggling with addiction. Despite the challenges, my town has its positives. The elementary school my son attends has an excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. My son has special needs, but he's never faced bullying due to the positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that organizes various events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. The school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child has to go hungry. We have a zero-tolerance policy towards anyone feeling less than due to financial constraints, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made significant improvements to the town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side, where I live, tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for my neighbors and me. Despite this, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options to meet our needs, and although our home may not be worth much, it's comfortable and suitable for us. We've lived here for over 16 years, and I couldn't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is a melting pot of cultures, nestled on a hill surrounded by historic buildings that reflect its rich heritage. My apartment, a 7-story high-rise, faces the old theater, while just a block away, an arcade bar is the hotspot for people from all walks of life on warm summer nights. During June and July weekends, you'll often spot a line of people waiting to get in. The nearby city park is a tranquil oasis, with its expansive size considering its location. Concrete walls with stairs encircle the park, providing a sense of security. During the harsh winter months, homeless individuals set up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and steps, taking advantage of the proximity to the city's only family center, where they can access basic amenities like bathing and showering facilities. What I appreciate most about my city, though, isn't its picturesque architecture or historic landmarks. It's the people themselves who make this place special. You see, Hilltop once had a notorious reputation for gang violence, with stories of federal officials and the DEA sweeping in to clean up the streets still being passed down through generations. Despite its rough reputation, the community has worked hard to keep the area clean and cared for. They take pride in their city and neighborhood, as evident in the way they look out for one another. Some say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill at night, a warning that still lingers from the past and is tainted with social conditioning. I believe this warning is a reminder of the racism and assumptions that plague our nation, even in a city that prides itself as a melting pot. I'm grateful to be part of this community, where I've experienced kindness and generosity from strangers. Walking the streets at night, I've been offered jackets, phone charges, and words of encouragement from people who have seen beyond my skin color. It's a place where I feel at home, where I'm reminded that I'm valued and beautiful, even on the darkest of nights.",
            "I reside in a small town in rural America, specifically in Michigan, where the landscape transitions seamlessly from farmland to quaint tourist towns. You won't find massive shopping malls like Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee's here. Every time I need to go somewhere, I have to hit the road. But despite this, I live in one of the most breathtaking locations in the world, surrounded by water. My town is flanked by two incredible lakes: the majestic Lake Michigan and the serene Lake Charlevoix. Every spot you visit has its own little beach, inviting you to dip your toes in the cool waters. My neighborhood perfectly encapsulates the essence of a small town. The houses are not stacked haphazardly on top of one another; instead, they're unique, older homes that have been lovingly restored or updated. Many of the houses have basements that are visible from the street, and they're often adorned with beautiful, weathered aluminum siding. The neighborhood is a kaleidoscope of colors, with houses of every hue and style that surround my home. Most of the houses have spacious yards, complete with trampolines, playsets, and sometimes even gardens and fences for pets. The overall atmosphere is quintessentially Midwestern: hardworking people, families, and a strong sense of community. On any given day, you'll see kids running freely through the streets, people walking their dogs, biking, or rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors, and it's easy to spot those who are new to the area. You'll often see someone grilling outside and waving, or a neighbor from a few blocks away walking their dog and smiling warmly. The lawns are meticulously maintained, with neatly cut grass and tidy gardens. It's not a neighborhood that's going to leave you awestruck with its grandeur, but it's a place that exudes a sense of comfort, peace, and safety. Within walking distance, you'll find the county sheriff's department, the health department, and the city recycling center, which serves the community with valuable services. The nearby baseball and softball fields are always bustling with activity, and the sound of announcers calling out player names and keeping score is a familiar soundtrack to our town. Our small town airport is also nearby, adding to the lively atmosphere. You can easily walk to the local ice cream shop or bike to the park, which is just a few blocks away. It's an ideal place to call home."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "Living in a big city like mine, I've got a pretty diverse neighborhood. House areas are scattered around commercial areas, which are filled with various shops, offices, restaurants, and entertainment spots. You can easily find new places to eat or shop at, with a mix of big brands and small boutiques popping up everywhere. Some boutiques line the streets, often just a short walk away from quiet neighborhoods that would be peaceful if not for all the things to see and do. We've also got a few parks nearby, and I've noticed that people often take their kids there. As for the people, my neighborhood has its fair share of diversity. There's even a small area with a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a group of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. If you venture a bit further out, you'll find even more people of different races and origins, often grouped together in their own mini-communities within the city. Places like Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia are just a few miles away, but getting there can take a while due to the crazy traffic. It's a big city, and most people prefer not to walk anywhere - only a few miles can turn into a two-hour drive during rush hour. To make matters worse, we've got some of the worst traffic in the world, and parking spots are hard to come by. On top of that, there's been a lot of construction lately, with new apartment buildings springing up everywhere. Some people are happy about the growth, but many are worried about the extra crowds and traffic. As for housing, we've got a mix of big apartment buildings, houses of all sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condos. Some properties have single-family homes, while others have duplexes. Even in my immediate neighborhood, you can find all sorts of housing options. The same goes for the people living here - we've got a wide range of ages, and I don't even know most of my neighbors. It's not as tight-knit a community as it used to be when I was a kid, but I do have some fond memories of playing with my next-door neighbor and a few other friends from back in the day.",
            "My neighborhood is a sight to behold. Most of the homes here are single-family dwellings, but there are a few that have been divided into two separate units, while still sharing a common wall. My house has a small front yard and a driveway to the left, just like most of the others. It's a nostalgic sight, reminiscent of a time not so long ago when the suburbs were the epitome of the American dream. Although that dream has lost its allure for some, my neighborhood remains a testament to its enduring appeal. The people here don't radiate the same optimism they once did, and the upkeep of the lawns has suffered, but there are still cars parked in every driveway, and the youth still play with abandon, as if nothing's changed. The local public school, which has been around for almost 90 years, still stands tall, giving the kids a glimpse of the future, while transporting the older residents back to a bygone era. The churches are few and far between, but the basketball courts are still bustling with activity. Despite the varying appearances of the homes, they all feel the same. There's a large supermarket called Super \"A\", owned by a Yemeni family, who are possibly the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The majority of residents, however, are African American. The streets are wide and spacious, and the kids usually play football, giving way to passing cars. Most people in my neighborhood have lived here for generations, and they can recall a time when everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school, but when the karate kid movies fell out of favor, the kids lost interest, so it's now a pharmacy, as everyone seems to think that medication can cure anything. There's also a small movie theater that shows old movies at a discounted price, which seems to please the older folks, who think it's a small price to pay for an evening out, minus the kids, of course. Our town is connected to the next one by a single expressway, but the entrance and exit are actually in the adjacent town. There was once a petition to get an exit in our town, but the youth supported it, while the older residents opposed it, fearing that the expressway would ruin our town. They managed to persuade the city council to reject the proposal. We're currently building a new high school, and we're still deciding on a mascot for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the perfect representation of our town.",
            "At first glance, this place may not seem like much - a residential area behind a shopping strip that's easy to overlook. It's not the kind of place that jumps out at you as having much to offer. But, if you take a walk behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and head back behind the hotels that are only occupied for part of the year, you'll stumble upon a thriving community. The streets here are lined with a row of apartment complexes, each one carefully situated next to the others like a series of connected puzzle pieces. These aren't the kind of places you'd expect to find in an area like this, but they're actually a world unto themselves that most people who live here don't even know about. Across the street from these complexes is a community college campus - a set of quiet, sleepy buildings that seem almost out of place alongside the bustling road. Students shuffle in, yawning and clutching their coffee, on their way to start their day at 7 am. The iron gates creak open to let them in, while commuters behind the wheel mutter and shake their fists in frustration when they get stuck behind them. Further down the road, another residential street intersects, lined with a park and a rehabilitation center for people with broken bones. The treatment center has a cheerful, welcoming atmosphere, with a lazy ceiling fan spinning gently above and a porch full of furniture. Children play in the park across the street, laughing and running through the grass while bees flit lazily around the flowers. Retirees walk their dogs on the walking path, shaking their heads at the teenagers on skateboards but smiling at the teenage girls gossiping by the playground equipment. A sushi place in a strip mall near the park has affordable food but never seems to be busy, while a swimming supply store and nail salon are right next door. You could fill your pool for the season, get a manicure, and enjoy some hibachi chicken all in one go - the kind of convenience that's hard to find. There's even a frozen yogurt shop where you can grab a treat while watching the teens do tricks on their skateboards and vape. This neighborhood is a slice of quintessential America, a piece of history in the sleepy south where time itself seems to stand still.",
            "As we cruised down the winding road lined with endless cornfields, my friend gazed out at the seemingly endless landscape. \"Where are we?\" she asked, taken aback by the vast open spaces. I smiled knowingly, anticipating her shock at the stark difference from the bustling town she was used to, where the grocery store was just a stone's throw away from her doorstep. Growing up in a small town in rural Ohio, I was familiar with this kind of scenery, and I shared my own experiences with her. In that moment, she finally grasped who I was and where I came from.\n\nAs we continued down the two-lane road, a tranquil quarry came into view, its calm waters reflecting the sky above. Just beyond it lay the quaint development where I lived, a collection of brick and stucco homes that each boasted a generous half-acre plot, lovingly tended by their owners. During spring, vibrant flowers bloomed alongside the region's iconic midwestern trees, their changing leaves a constant reminder of the passing seasons. The driveways were a sight to behold, lined with sleek Mercedes-Benz luxury cars that glistened in the sunlight after a refreshing wash. My friendly Korean neighbor, a constant presence in our community, could often be found tending to his lawn, his cheerful humming a stark contrast to the whirring of his John Deere mower.\n\nAs we approached my home, a grey stucco house nestled among the trees, the sounds of the outdoors grew louder – the occasional honk of a goose, the chirping of birds, and the soothing hum of the nearby stream. The Terrier, ever vigilant, chased after the geese in the side yard, while the bullfrogs and the occasional \"moo\" from the nearby farms added to the symphony of sounds. A handmade wooden bridge spanned the small stream, leading to a hidden oasis teeming with wildflowers, herbs, and naturally growing trees – a sanctuary where I spent countless hours as a child. From building tree forts to \"hunting\" animals (which mostly involved chasing them), there was never a dull moment, and I was always surrounded by friends from the neighborhood.\n\nIn the harsh winters, our small town transformed into a winter wonderland. The once-vibrant trees stood bare, their branches etched against the grey sky like skeletal fingers. But when snow fell, the backyard was transformed into a magical landscape of snow angels and snowmen, crafted by my mischievous little sister and me. We'd engage in fierce snowball fights, our arsenal of branches and sticks at the ready, and construct elaborate forts to house our winter wonderland. In those carefree days, nothing else mattered – just the joy of childhood, untainted by the complexities of adulthood.",
            "You gotta understand what being \"weird\" means in Portland, Oregon. The unofficial town motto, scribbled on a building that's a pizza joint, bar, music venue, and strip club all rolled into one, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, it's a nostalgic call to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a time when the city was less known, less expensive, and birthed unique subcultures. Others see it as a welcoming invitation - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but this time as a compliment. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the never-ending construction of new condos to house them, Portland remains weird. Being weird doesn't mean we're always accepting, but it does mean we're open to things that others might not be. We're not a place without modern conveniences or modern problems - we buy most of our stuff from China, just like everyone else. Being weird can mean a million different things, but in Portland, there's also plenty of normalcy. We have yoga, hipsters, and suits, just like any other city. Maybe weird just means we don't take ourselves too seriously. In my neighborhood, it's not uncommon to see colorful houses, home gardens overflowing with flowers, herbs, and veggies, and free boxes lining the streets in the summer. Free boxes contain all sorts of treasures - clothes, books, or anything else someone's getting rid of. Sometimes, they're magical, containing just the thing you need. That's what Portland is all about to me - the thrill of discovering something amazing on a random walk through a Southeast Portland neighborhood. Of course, I'm just one of the many weirdos who call this city home. Some of my neighbors would never be caught dead rummaging through a free box on the sidewalk. They'd rather go to goat yoga or catch a Timbers game (that's the city's soccer team). Portland's full of people who love all sorts of things, from unusual hobbies to wild ambitions. We're a city of dreamers, and dreamers who spend way too much time at the bar. Yes, we have problems with substance abuse, which often stem from deeper mental health issues. And yeah, the constant rain and grey skies don't exactly help. We also have a homelessness problem, which no one seems to know how to tackle. The homeless population is drawn by the social services we offer, but they're just not enough. Our non-homeless residents are torn between sympathy and frustration. In this, we're not so weird after all.",
            "The mountains have been steadfast companions, silently bearing witness to the sun's daily rituals of dawn and dusk. Unchanging and unwavering, they remain unaffected by life's turmoil and tribulations. On days when I'm overwhelmed and stressed, they beckon me to pause and take in their serene beauty, lending me the strength to carry on, one day at a time. I first fell under their spell when I began my university journey, and the mountains north of campus have held a special place in my heart ever since. While the university grounds have their own charms, from the striking buildings to the picturesque ponds and trees, it's the mountains that truly command my affection. The rest of the town is equally captivating, with its numerous cafes that have been the backdrop for countless hours of late-night studying fueled by caffeine. I cherish the memories of strolling or taking the bus to downtown, surrounded by the faded grandeur of old buildings, which blends seamlessly with the vibrant energy of the urban city. Yet, it's easy to retreat from the bustle and return to the tranquil atmosphere of the small town by simply walking past the library. This juxtaposition of contrasting atmospheres has created a unique sense of wonder, as if the town is constantly inviting me to explore its depths. Every memory I've created, whether it's sharing laughter with friends under the rusted swings in the park or rushing through downtown to catch a movie, is tied to a specific part of town. The ponds, however, hold a special significance - they've been a sanctuary for reflection and, at times, a cry for help during my darkest nights of self-doubt. As I sit by the water, watching the turtles, ducks, and insects go about their lives, I'm reminded of my own search for purpose and meaning. I often find myself lost in thought, pondering the mysteries of life, but as I walk past the pond, the park, and the houses, I reach the main street, where the sun's radiance paints the sky with hues of yellow and blue. And there, I'm reminded of the mountains, always present, yet often overlooked. They stand tall, their grandeur a source of inspiration, urging me to persevere.",
            "If you're planning a trip to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you won't have a hard time finding it. The public transportation in New York City is great, making it super easy to get around. Bensonhurst is a pretty urban area, so you'll still get that quintessential New York City vibe during your visit. As you walk around, keep an eye out for the numerous Asian stores that dot the neighborhood. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurst has seen a significant influx of Asian residents, which is reflected in the abundance of Asian-owned stores on almost every block. You'll likely find Asian supermarkets and laundromats in abundance, and the locals love them for their great food quality, affordable prices, and convenience. Just a block away from me, there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk of each other, making grocery shopping a breeze. Of course, Bensonhurst isn't exclusively Asian - it's a melting pot of cultures, with immigrants and their American-born kids calling the neighborhood home. Many of the big businesses in the area are Asian-owned, but you'll also find a beautiful, recently renovated park nearby with plenty of facilities like basketball courts, a soccer/baseball field, handball courts, a playground, and even a water feature for kids to enjoy during the summer. As you'd expect in New York City, the park is a vibrant hub of activity, showcasing the area's diversity in the best possible light. One thing you won't find in abundance in Bensonhurst is corporate skyscrapers - co-op living buildings and condominium apartments are the norm, with many residents living in two-family homes. The people here are generally nice, but be warned: the noise levels can get pretty high, with cars blasting music and speeding down the streets. If you're planning a nighttime visit, be mindful of your surroundings - while the neighborhood is safe, you can never be too careful. I've had my share of run-ins with troublemakers in the past, including a physical altercation and a package theft incident. While it's a common problem, package theft is a concern in this area. One more thing to watch out for: dog owners who don't clean up after their pets. Every morning, you'll likely spot dog waste on the sidewalk or near the train station or supermarket. My pet peeve? Dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be sure to keep your shoes clean!",
            "Lately, I've been noticing that my neighborhood lacks sidewalks, and my house happens to be situated at the top of the steepest hill in the area. Locals have nicknamed it the \"workout hill\" since joggers often use it as part of their daily routine. Due to the absence of sidewalks on my street, everyone walks on the road, which can be hazardous, especially with potholes scattered here and there. The telephone and electric wires around the block appear tattered, and constant storms cause branches and debris to knock down the power lines, necessitating frequent repairs. It's a common sight to see patchwork repairs on these wires. The landscape is dominated by tall evergreen trees, but residents tend to cut them down to preserve the ocean view. Many houses are built with large glass-fronted second stories to take in the breathtaking view of the bay. Watching the sunset is a treat, with the water getting lit up from below, and the sky turning orange. However, most days are overcast, resulting in a damp atmosphere and a lot of haze. Moss grows profusely on everything, including roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked for a month, and when I returned, it was a green, moss-covered mess that took three hours to clean off. Our neighborhood is relatively quiet, with not many children around, except for a school a short distance away. Mostly retired people reside in our area, and instead of kids, you often see dogs roaming the streets or racing each other. They're quite common in our neighborhood, and if you leave a door or window open, you risk having them sneak into your house. I once found one in my living room and had to shoo it out the front door. Rabbits are also abundant in the area, and while they can be a nuisance to gardeners as they dig up plant roots and burrow into lawns, my cats enjoy hunting them. We also have our fair share of birds, including small sparrows, hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle that swoops by before being chased away by crows. If you're willing to hike downhill to the waterfront, you can find a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. The shoreline isn't extensive, but the rocks along the shore are fun to throw into the water. The bay is relatively narrow, and on most days, you can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist.",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area in a small town in Tennessee, surrounded by state highways that bring a moderate amount of traffic to our quiet street. Our neighborhood is generally stable, with not many new residents moving in, so I've gotten accustomed to knowing most of my neighbors. Daily life revolves around yard work and daily routines. In winter, we enjoy sledding down the hill on our side street, and since our house is located at the front of our street, we have a clear view of everyone passing by. We're always on the lookout for unfamiliar vehicles. Some neighbors take walks for exercise or to walk their dogs, while kids can be seen riding their bikes. We spend most of our time at home working from our house, with my wife and our two daughters – aged eleven and fourteen – keeping me company. As a result, everyone in the neighborhood is familiar with our coming and going. We're not ones to shy away from spending time outdoors, even on rainy days. Occasionally, we fire up the barbecue on our back deck, filling the air with a pleasant smell. The sound of lawn mowers is a regular occurrence from March to October, a reminder that our neighborhood was once a wooded area and still retains its lush tree cover. This brings a lot of shade, but also a lot of leaves in the fall, requiring us to rake and burn them annually. I must admit, I enjoy the smell of burning leaves, a sure sign that fall has arrived. Lately, the lack of winter has made the season feel like a prolonged fall. Our garage, located at the back of our house, sees minimal use, except when I'm working on my truck or other projects, which allows me to stay connected to the neighborhood. Holidays are generally quiet, with occasional visits from out-of-town family members during Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, and Christmas, resulting in an influx of cars on our street. Overall, I'm content with living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be an ideal neighborhood.",
            "My home is situated smack in the middle of a high desert landscape, where dirt and dust seem to rule supreme. Anyone who hasn't experienced living here wouldn't grasp the perpetual sight of brown hues and the sense of awe when spotting a lawn, which is usually a result of extensive maintenance. When I first moved here in the 90s, houses were scattered far and wide, giving it a more secluded feel. Although it's not much different now, with new developments sprouting up, our neighborhood is slowly transforming into a bustling urban area, just like many other places. The people here are generally friendly, but, like any city, it has its share of good and not-so-good aspects. I've been fortunate to be surrounded by kind-hearted elderly folks, making my neighborhood a more pleasant place to live. Our local stores are mostly chains, such as Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you're craving fresh produce, you'll have to venture out. The dominant industries in my city appear to be construction, as there's still plenty of open space left to be developed. This prospect unsettles me a bit, as I prefer things as they are. I left behind the hustle and bustle of a big city and don't want to go back. Speaking of construction, my job as a drywall and T-bar installer is located in this very field. What I appreciate about my home is the diverse wildlife. The high desert is a magnet for visitors, not just for its breathtaking beauty but also for the unique ecosystems it supports. It's essential for human residents to learn about the non-human inhabitants of this environment to coexist peacefully and responsibly. My family and I have grown accustomed to the local wildlife, and my kids are particularly fond of lizards and desert insects. As I write this, they're outside trying to catch various specimens. When it comes to attractions, we have a few notable ones. Victorville is an excellent destination for families looking to experience the desert. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with the San Bernardino County Fair, which offers an unforgettable experience with a mix of activities and fun. Visit nearby Wrightwood to witness the snow-capped mountains and take part in winter sports to cap off your visit. For those interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem, the Victor Valley Museum is a must-visit, featuring geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of Victorville's development and growth.",
            "When people ask me to describe my neighborhood, I give answers that are, in a way, quite distinct. You see, my neighbors aren't just the folks who live next door, but the people I share my college campus with. The dormitory I stay in is my community, and the surrounding campus is my neighborhood too, albeit to a lesser degree. Now, you might think my situation's a bit unusual, but my neighborhood still shares some common traits with what you'd expect from a typical neighborhood. It's got houses, people, stores, and parks – the basics, really. Let's start with the \"houses\" in my neighborhood, although they're a bit different from what you'd find elsewhere. In my neck of the woods, we've got three types of housing: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory houses. First off, the apartments usually have 2-4 people sharing a room, with 4-6 rooms per floor, and about 20 people living in each building on average. Then there are the actual houses, which are mostly 2-4 bedroom setups rented by alumni, but there aren't many of those around. Last but not least, we've got the dorm rooms, which are the most common type of housing here, with two people sharing a room, except in some cases. With housing covered, let's move on to the people. My school's all about being diverse, and that's reflected in my neighborhood's makeup. We've got people from all walks of life and cultures living here, with the professional staff in the houses, new students in the dorms, and older students in the apartments. Talking about the people here would take too long, so let's skip to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. As my school is basically a self-contained neighborhood, we've got plenty of stores and a single park. The stores offer a mix of regular dining options and the school's own brand of clothing and grocery stores, so you can find everything you need within our neighborhood boundaries. Our park is a playground for all the diverse folks in my neighborhood, kept clean and safe thanks to everyone's efforts.",
            "I've been living in this neighborhood for about 10 years now, so I guess I can share some of my experiences. When I first moved here from Riverdale to Stockbridge, I was really down in the dumps. I cried because I missed my old place and the people there, but my parents wanted the best for my little sister and me, so we had to move to a better area with a nicer house and a better school. Looking back, it was a tough transition, but I slowly got used to it and made some new friends and acquaintances in school. I didn't really get to know my neighbors that well, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis, who lived right next door. They've been like family to me over the years, and I'm grateful for their presence in my life. I still remember the time I went to Mr. Glen's wedding - it was a blast, and I'm looking forward to having a similar celebration when I get married someday and can give my future wife the life she deserves. At the wedding, I was lucky enough to catch the little strap that Ms. Veda threw off her leg, but unfortunately, I missed the flowers. I had a great time dancing with Marsharii, Mr. Glen's daughter, but I haven't seen her since. I hope she's doing well and achieving her goals. This neighborhood can be confusing, but with the help of GPS, I've been able to explore it more. I've hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis, and we used to spend hours playing video games and just enjoying life. Sometimes I'd go to the park and connect with nature, which helps calm me down and brings me a sense of peace. I also like to visit the park and practice my balance with sticks I bought from Home Depot, and I sometimes bring my bokken wooden sword along. I enjoy doing what I love. There are also a basketball and tennis court nearby, although I haven't played in a while, it's nice to know they're there in case I want to pick it up again. My dad used to take me and my best friend to play tennis with Mr. Graves, and we always had a great time, even though they pushed us hard. I've had a lot of fun in this neighborhood, and there are plenty of stories to share, but these are the ones that really stand out to me. I'm excited to see what the future holds.",
            "Living in my neighborhood is pretty ideal for me because it's just a short walk to the college I attend. Most of the apartments around me are decently priced, and there are some affordable bars and restaurants nearby that I enjoy going to. However, one of the bars just got a new name and seems to be priced a bit higher, but the quality of service and drinks is still good. The crowd is generally nice, consisting of college students and low-income residents. The area is also quite family-friendly, with an elementary school nearby that's within walking distance. I don't really know my neighbors, but I'm a bit amused by how they often smoke weed - the management even installed an air freshener unit in front of their door, which my boyfriend and I found quite funny. It's almost like they're being mocked. The buildings in my area are mostly old but have been renovated inside. Down the street, there are some brand new apartments, but I'm not a fan because I heard the construction wasn't great and the rent is still quite high. I think it's a scam, but since they're close to campus, the management gets away with it. There's a super cheap restaurant nearby that serves food on paper plates and microwaves most of their dishes. Across from it is a gas station that's not exactly a great place to work. Thanks to some city funding, the road was repaved last summer, making it look a bit nicer with a big sidewalk and lots of grass. However, my apartment building is surrounded by a lot of trees, which I think is nice. They've cut down a few, but there are still plenty more than in the surrounding areas. Behind my building is a tree line and another apartment complex. The street behind mine is 43rd, and it's not as nice as 42nd where I live. The sidewalks are in bad shape, and most of the buildings look run-down. The street is lined with trees, but it's probably just to hide the state of the buildings. There have been some issues with crime in the area, particularly at an apartment complex on 43rd, but I don't think it's entirely their fault. There are other apartments across from me with similar problems and a transient population. Despite this, I like living here because it's affordable and convenient, with the university nearby and two bus stops for easy access to the store and downtown.",
            "I live in a neighborhood with a unique charm. It's made up of identical-looking duplexes on a cul-de-sac, each painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. The friendly vibe is palpable, with most neighbors getting along and even chatting with each other on their driveways in the evenings. It's a refreshing escape from the digital world we're often immersed in, like stepping back in time. We're surrounded by lush fields, trees, and the vast blue sky with puffy white clouds, creating a serene atmosphere. However, this season brought some unexpected challenges – tornado warnings and actual sirens that forced us to seek shelter. I was right there in my bathtub, clutching my little dog and my purse, while my bigger dog stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The neighborhood was eerily quiet, except for the sound of hail pounding the ground. As the storm passed, the temperature dropped drastically, causing the road to steam up. The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement, and as I looked up, a beautiful double rainbow appeared in the sky. I quickly grabbed my camera and snapped some amazing shots to share with my friends and family on Facebook. They were just as amazed as I was. The streets remained quiet for a while until people returned home, and then it was back to normal – kids playing outside while their parents cooked dinner. I'm so grateful to have found this lovely neighborhood, especially after moving from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I adore the Southern accent and the friendly people. My two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment might look the same as the others on the outside, but each one has its unique interior. Some are surprisingly small, and I'm still trying to figure out why. I love taking long walks through the big field behind my home and strolling down to the pond, where I often spot deer and listen to the enchanting song of the bullfrog. It's a great place to live, just 40 minutes outside Charlotte. Every morning starts with the sweet sound of roosters crowing from the nearby farms, giving me a sense of living in a small village community. Even the nearby farm has a lovable donkey that brays in the evening to remind us he's there. I feel so lucky to have found this gem of a neighborhood.",
            "My family and I moved into this neighborhood a little while before I started eighth grade. It took some time for me to adjust and make friends, but I ended up becoming close to two neighbours, one of whom lives just two doors down from me and the other on the same street. Unfortunately, they're no longer living here now, but the memories we made are still vivid. The people who've been here since I first moved in are still around, which is nice. My neighbourhood is pretty typical, with rows of two-story houses, and every weekend when the weather's warm, you can hear kids playing outside. It's usually pretty quiet here most weekdays, though. I've never had any issues with my neighbours, and I feel comfortable trusting them. I've ordered plenty of packages online and never had one go missing from my porch. There's a park about a minute's walk from my house, where I have lots of fond memories. I used to play basketball, football, and baseball with the other guys in the neighbourhood, but one of my worst memories is also from there – I got elbowed in the nose while playing football! Despite that, the good times far outweigh the bad. Nowadays, when I visit the park, it's usually to spend time with my cousin's younger kids. They love playing on the swings and slides, and it brings a smile to my face seeing them have so much fun. The park holds a special place in my heart, and every time I go there, I'm filled with nostalgia. \n\nMy neighbourhood is pretty diverse, with loads of different food options nearby. Within a one-mile radius, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, with the rise of food delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash, many people just order in instead of going out. The most popular spots are usually the fast food chains, which are common in most suburban neighbourhoods. There are plenty of pizza places too. The local stores have everything you could need, including multiple dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store – a popular chain in the Midwest. Some of the stores even cater to specific tastes, like an Indian-owned shop where you can buy ingredients for homemade Indian dishes or ready-made food. Overall, I'm really happy with my neighbourhood. When I see the horror stories on social media and the news about people's experiences with their neighbours, I feel grateful for mine.",
            "My neighborhood is a humble little town in South Carolina. It may not stand out, but it has a significant impact on the region's agriculture. Johnston proudly claims to be the Peach Capital of the World, and this pride is reflected on the town's welcoming sign. The town is mainly composed of farmland with peach trees and cattle dominating the landscape. Houses are scattered, with most being two-story homes featuring either metal or gray roofs to combat the scorching summer heat. Those situated outside the main part of town are often farther back from the road, allowing for the front fields to be used for animals and crops. The main part of town is marked by a single four-way stop light, where you'll find the town's only stores. For those craving convenience food, there's Hong Kong, a family-run Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, but it sadly closed down not too long ago. You'll also find Maxwell and Halford Drug, a small family-owned pharmacy famous for their Cherry Coca-Cola. A small, but pricey grocery store called IGA is the town's only supermarket, but many residents prefer to visit the Walmart in nearby Batesburg-Leesville for their grocery needs. The most popular store in town, however, is Dollar General, which sells a wide range of everyday essentials and is always bustling from opening to closing time. There's also Possibilities Furniture & More, a cozy furniture store run by a well-known local woman who hires movers to deliver purchased items. Next door to the furniture store is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a small pet groomers offering various services like daycare, boarding, and grooming. Both the doctor's and veterinary practice are situated outside the main part of town, but they're both well-equipped to serve the community. Johnston Elementary School is the town's only school, and students attend middle and high school in the neighboring town after completing fifth grade. Although there aren't many parks or entertainment options, the town is currently developing a 2.5-acre recreational area to provide families with more opportunities for outdoor activities and attract new residents. Despite its simplicity, Johnston is a charming town that can easily go unnoticed in the blink of an eye.",
            "The first time I heard about my area, I was tuning into a podcast about people who had vanished. It caught me off guard, as almost every apartment in the neighborhood was being sold for over $1000 a month. I had never heard anything about it, nor had any of my friends. I guess that's what happens when you're struggling. I know a few of my friends have trouble sleeping at night because things are just so expensive. But we've learned to be frugal over the years. You start to get used to the smell of flea market toys and old clothes that have been tucked away for a while. You smell less in adulthood, and you might even start smoking or just get used to things being a certain way. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty old magazines stacked on an old piano, and it gets stuck in the leather even after you wash it. Our neighborhood has three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start from the far side, you can visit two charity shops, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curio shop. Downtown is crowded, with cars and people everywhere in the morning, but you wouldn't know it in the thrift stores. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the stores are always quiet. It's a great place to waste an afternoon. Every year, there are more and more cars and people flooding the city. It's developing, they say. One of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery calls it home, and it's still showing signs of growth. It reminds me of New York. Everyone's got their own goals, and nobody really bothers you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep your shell as long as you want, and the city will just roll with it. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have more of a community of friends than a bunch of strangers living in an apartment. We come together for birthdays, funerals, and when we need each other. In some ways, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors, and they treat me pretty well. I try to keep my apartment clean and leave them food, and they do the same for me. We exchange mail and it's nice to see them. I think they enjoy my presence just as much as I do theirs. Despite living in a massive, impersonal modernist sprawl, it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't completely mess up my life.",
            "My neighborhood is a classic example of cookie cutter suburbia. I live in an area where the presence of a homeowner's association is strongly felt. As soon as you step in, you'll notice rows of perfectly maintained single-family homes, thanks to the HOA. The front yards are surprisingly uniform, with a small patch of grass, decorative pebbles, and short driveways. Every now and then, you'll spot a small tree or two. It's also common to see two-car garages on most homes. The roads are immaculate, with newly paved concrete and no potholes in sight. While the majority of houses are single-story, a few have two stories. One thing that stands out is the unique mailbox system. Instead of having individual mailboxes in front of each house, we have a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street, which requires a key to access your specific box. There are also two larger lockers for packages, all thanks to the HOA's emphasis on uniformity. Our neighborhood is situated on the outskirts of the nearby city, making it a mix of rural and suburban living. As a result, we have plenty of space for various amenities. There are multiple community pools, all well-maintained and gated, where anyone living here can swim. We also have walking trails where you can take your dog for a walk or enjoy an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get some exercise; simply running around the neighborhood will suffice.\n\nThe community is predominantly made up of retirees, who make up a significant portion of the residents. It's an extremely safe area, with everyone looking out for one another. Mixed in with the retirees are a few middle-aged and young professionals. Our city is surprisingly large in terms of population but has a small-town feel. We have all the amenities you'd expect, including a single mall that may not be huge but gets the job done. It takes me around 15 minutes to drive to any major destination, but once I arrive, I'm greeted with a variety of stores to choose from. We have high-end grocery stores with organic options to bargain outlets with limited selection and minimal staff to keep costs low. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have many nice amenities like pools and walking trails, and while we're not right next door to shopping, it's just a short drive to get to any major chain store.",
            "I reside in a small Midwestern town just on the outskirts of a major city, nestled in the suburbs. My neighborhood, situated on the east side, is considered one of the economically disadvantaged areas of the town. The property values are relatively low, with many houses being rented or owned by families with lower incomes. Yet, it's not an uninviting place. My neighbors are generally friendly folks who greet me with a smile when I walk down the street. Although the crime rates are slightly higher than in other parts of town, they're still manageable. Over the past decade, there have been some violent incidents, including a few shootings and a homicide, within a few blocks of my home. I recall our next-door neighbors losing their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Thankfully, our family hasn't been directly affected by crime, except for the occasional missing item from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. Our town has been significantly impacted by the \"opioid epidemic\" that has affected many parts of the United States. However, there are various resources available to combat this issue, including rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those struggling with addiction. Despite these challenges, our town has many appealing qualities. My son's elementary school boasts an excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. He has not faced any bullying, thanks to the positive atmosphere of the school, and he genuinely enjoys attending. We have an active PTO that organizes numerous events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Given that over 20% of our town's population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. No child or family is treated as inferior due to financial constraints, and the costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are relatively low. The City Council and staff have made efforts to improve our town's appearance, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side, where I reside, tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for my neighbors and me. Overall, I appreciate living in this town. People are generally kind, the schools are excellent, there are sufficient shopping options to meet our needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it's comfortable and suitable. We've lived here for over 16 years, and it's hard to imagine calling anywhere else home.",
            "My neighborhood is a melting pot of culture, perched on a hill amidst a cluster of buildings steeped in history. I reside in a 7-story apartment building, directly opposite the old theater, and just a block away is this charming arcade bar that attracts a diverse crowd on warm summer evenings. On weekends in June and July, a long queue often forms outside its doors. Just a few blocks up is the city's nearest park, a sprawling green space considering its location in this part of town. The park is surrounded by concrete, with tall stairs carved into the wall. During the harsh winter months, homeless people set up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and the wide steps. This strategic placement keeps them relatively warmer, despite the lack of snow, and allows them easy access to the nearby family center, where they can bathe and shower. What I cherish about my city, though, isn't its historic architecture or the grand buildings that dot the hillsides. It's the community that truly makes it special. You see, Hilltop was once notorious for gang violence on the West Coast. Even decades later, stories of the federal government and DEA swooping in to clean up the streets still circulate. The people haven't forgotten. These stories are passed down through generations, from the original residents to newcomers like me, as a reminder of the neighborhood's rough past. Despite its reputation, the community works hard to maintain its cleanliness and care about what goes on in their city and on their block. They even caution outsiders not to venture out after dark, a warning that still carries the weight of its troubled history. As a 'not-quite-white' girl, I feel a connection to this community. Perhaps it's because I'm dark enough to blend in, or maybe Hilltop has accepted me as one of their own, someone who's aware of the ingrained racism and biases that plague our society. I know one thing: Hilltop will always be my home. I feel alive strolling through the streets at night, surrounded by people who've shown me kindness and empathy more often than not. It's a place where laundromats stay open late to let me charge my phone when I'm caught in the rain, and where strangers have handed me money and told me I'm beautiful and valuable, even when I felt invisible.",
            "I live in the heart of Rural America, nestled in the quaint town of Michigan. My home is surrounded by the picturesque beauty of farmland and charming tourist cities. Life here is simple, with no big city malls, chain stores like Wal-mart or Target, or restaurants like Applebee's within reach. You have to drive to get anywhere, but the journey is worth it, as I'm blessed to live in one of the most breathtaking places on earth, surrounded by two magnificent lakes - Lake Michigan to the one side and Lake Charlevoix to the other. Every corner of our small town offers a serene beach to dip your toes in, making it a haven for those seeking tranquility. My neighborhood is a classic example of small-town living, with houses that reflect the essence of Middle America. These aren't cookie-cutter homes, but rather unique, older residences that have been lovingly updated and remodeled over the years. Many of these homes boast basements, some of which are fully-fledged and open to the eye from the street. The neighborhood is a kaleidoscope of colors, with houses painted in every hue imaginable. Most homes have spacious yards, complete with trampolines, playsets, gardens, and fences for pets. Our community is comprised of hardworking individuals who strive to make a living and raise their families. On any given day, you'll see kids playing in the streets, people strolling their dogs, biking, or rollerblading. Neighbors know one another, and it's not uncommon to see a friendly wave or a smile from a passerby. The lawns are meticulously maintained, with green grass and well-trimmed plants adding to the neighborhood's charm. While it may not be the most stunning neighborhood you've ever seen, it's one that exudes a sense of belonging and a promise of a safe haven. Within walking distance, you'll find the county sheriff's department, the health department, and the recycling center, all of which serve our community. Our small town is also home to baseball and softball fields, where you can hear the excitement of the game, and a nearby airport where small planes take off and land. You can stroll to the local ice cream parlor, and if you're feeling adventurous, take a short walk downtown. The best part? My kids can ride their bikes to the nearby park, just 8 blocks away. It's a wonderful place to call home."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "Living in a big city like mine, I've got a pretty diverse neighborhood. House areas are scattered around commercial areas, which are filled with various shops, offices, restaurants, and entertainment spots. You can easily find new places to eat or shop at, with a mix of big brands and small boutiques popping up everywhere. Some boutiques line the streets, often just a short walk away from quiet neighborhoods that would be peaceful if not for all the things to see and do. We've also got a few parks nearby, and I've noticed that people often take their kids there. As for the people, my neighborhood has its fair share of diversity. There's even a small area with a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a group of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. If you venture a bit further out, you'll find even more people of different races and origins, often grouped together in their own mini-communities within the city. Places like Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia are just a few miles away, but getting there can take a while due to the crazy traffic. It's a big city, and most people prefer not to walk anywhere - only a few miles can turn into a two-hour drive during rush hour. To make matters worse, we've got some of the worst traffic in the world, and parking spots are hard to come by. On top of that, there's been a lot of construction lately, with new apartment buildings springing up everywhere. Some people are happy about the growth, but many are worried about the extra crowds and traffic. As for housing, we've got a mix of big apartment buildings, houses of all sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condos. Some properties have single-family homes, while others have duplexes. Even in my immediate neighborhood, you can find all sorts of housing options. The same goes for the people living here - we've got a wide range of ages, and I don't even know most of my neighbors. It's not as tight-knit a community as it used to be when I was a kid, but I do have some fond memories of playing with my next-door neighbor and a few other friends from back in the day.",
            "My neighborhood is a sight to behold. Most of the homes here are single-family dwellings, but there are a few that have been divided into two separate units, while still sharing a common wall. My house has a small front yard and a driveway to the left, just like most of the others. It's a nostalgic sight, reminiscent of a time not so long ago when the suburbs were the epitome of the American dream. Although that dream has lost its allure for some, my neighborhood remains a testament to its enduring appeal. The people here don't radiate the same optimism they once did, and the upkeep of the lawns has suffered, but there are still cars parked in every driveway, and the youth still play with abandon, as if nothing's changed. The local public school, which has been around for almost 90 years, still stands tall, giving the kids a glimpse of the future, while transporting the older residents back to a bygone era. The churches are few and far between, but the basketball courts are still bustling with activity. Despite the varying appearances of the homes, they all feel the same. There's a large supermarket called Super \"A\", owned by a Yemeni family, who are possibly the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The majority of residents, however, are African American. The streets are wide and spacious, and the kids usually play football, giving way to passing cars. Most people in my neighborhood have lived here for generations, and they can recall a time when everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school, but when the karate kid movies fell out of favor, the kids lost interest, so it's now a pharmacy, as everyone seems to think that medication can cure anything. There's also a small movie theater that shows old movies at a discounted price, which seems to please the older folks, who think it's a small price to pay for an evening out, minus the kids, of course. Our town is connected to the next one by a single expressway, but the entrance and exit are actually in the adjacent town. There was once a petition to get an exit in our town, but the youth supported it, while the older residents opposed it, fearing that the expressway would ruin our town. They managed to persuade the city council to reject the proposal. We're currently building a new high school, and we're still deciding on a mascot for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the perfect representation of our town.",
            "At first glance, this place may not seem like much - a residential area behind a shopping strip that's easy to overlook. It's not the kind of place that jumps out at you as having much to offer. But, if you take a walk behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and head back behind the hotels that are only occupied for part of the year, you'll stumble upon a thriving community. The streets here are lined with a row of apartment complexes, each one carefully situated next to the others like a series of connected puzzle pieces. These aren't the kind of places you'd expect to find in an area like this, but they're actually a world unto themselves that most people who live here don't even know about. Across the street from these complexes is a community college campus - a set of quiet, sleepy buildings that seem almost out of place alongside the bustling road. Students shuffle in, yawning and clutching their coffee, on their way to start their day at 7 am. The iron gates creak open to let them in, while commuters behind the wheel mutter and shake their fists in frustration when they get stuck behind them. Further down the road, another residential street intersects, lined with a park and a rehabilitation center for people with broken bones. The treatment center has a cheerful, welcoming atmosphere, with a lazy ceiling fan spinning gently above and a porch full of furniture. Children play in the park across the street, laughing and running through the grass while bees flit lazily around the flowers. Retirees walk their dogs on the walking path, shaking their heads at the teenagers on skateboards but smiling at the teenage girls gossiping by the playground equipment. A sushi place in a strip mall near the park has affordable food but never seems to be busy, while a swimming supply store and nail salon are right next door. You could fill your pool for the season, get a manicure, and enjoy some hibachi chicken all in one go - the kind of convenience that's hard to find. There's even a frozen yogurt shop where you can grab a treat while watching the teens do tricks on their skateboards and vape. This neighborhood is a slice of quintessential America, a piece of history in the sleepy south where time itself seems to stand still.",
            "As we cruised down the winding road lined with endless cornfields, my friend gazed out at the seemingly endless landscape. \"Where are we?\" she asked, taken aback by the vast open spaces. I smiled knowingly, anticipating her shock at the stark difference from the bustling town she was used to, where the grocery store was just a stone's throw away from her doorstep. Growing up in a small town in rural Ohio, I was familiar with this kind of scenery, and I shared my own experiences with her. In that moment, she finally grasped who I was and where I came from.\n\nAs we continued down the two-lane road, a tranquil quarry came into view, its calm waters reflecting the sky above. Just beyond it lay the quaint development where I lived, a collection of brick and stucco homes that each boasted a generous half-acre plot, lovingly tended by their owners. During spring, vibrant flowers bloomed alongside the region's iconic midwestern trees, their changing leaves a constant reminder of the passing seasons. The driveways were a sight to behold, lined with sleek Mercedes-Benz luxury cars that glistened in the sunlight after a refreshing wash. My friendly Korean neighbor, a constant presence in our community, could often be found tending to his lawn, his cheerful humming a stark contrast to the whirring of his John Deere mower.\n\nAs we approached my home, a grey stucco house nestled among the trees, the sounds of the outdoors grew louder – the occasional honk of a goose, the chirping of birds, and the soothing hum of the nearby stream. The Terrier, ever vigilant, chased after the geese in the side yard, while the bullfrogs and the occasional \"moo\" from the nearby farms added to the symphony of sounds. A handmade wooden bridge spanned the small stream, leading to a hidden oasis teeming with wildflowers, herbs, and naturally growing trees – a sanctuary where I spent countless hours as a child. From building tree forts to \"hunting\" animals (which mostly involved chasing them), there was never a dull moment, and I was always surrounded by friends from the neighborhood.\n\nIn the harsh winters, our small town transformed into a winter wonderland. The once-vibrant trees stood bare, their branches etched against the grey sky like skeletal fingers. But when snow fell, the backyard was transformed into a magical landscape of snow angels and snowmen, crafted by my mischievous little sister and me. We'd engage in fierce snowball fights, our arsenal of branches and sticks at the ready, and construct elaborate forts to house our winter wonderland. In those carefree days, nothing else mattered – just the joy of childhood, untainted by the complexities of adulthood.",
            "You gotta understand what being \"weird\" means in Portland, Oregon. The unofficial town motto, scribbled on a building that's a pizza joint, bar, music venue, and strip club all rolled into one, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, it's a nostalgic call to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a time when the city was less known, less expensive, and birthed unique subcultures. Others see it as a welcoming invitation - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but this time as a compliment. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the never-ending construction of new condos to house them, Portland remains weird. Being weird doesn't mean we're always accepting, but it does mean we're open to things that others might not be. We're not a place without modern conveniences or modern problems - we buy most of our stuff from China, just like everyone else. Being weird can mean a million different things, but in Portland, there's also plenty of normalcy. We have yoga, hipsters, and suits, just like any other city. Maybe weird just means we don't take ourselves too seriously. In my neighborhood, it's not uncommon to see colorful houses, home gardens overflowing with flowers, herbs, and veggies, and free boxes lining the streets in the summer. Free boxes contain all sorts of treasures - clothes, books, or anything else someone's getting rid of. Sometimes, they're magical, containing just the thing you need. That's what Portland is all about to me - the thrill of discovering something amazing on a random walk through a Southeast Portland neighborhood. Of course, I'm just one of the many weirdos who call this city home. Some of my neighbors would never be caught dead rummaging through a free box on the sidewalk. They'd rather go to goat yoga or catch a Timbers game (that's the city's soccer team). Portland's full of people who love all sorts of things, from unusual hobbies to wild ambitions. We're a city of dreamers, and dreamers who spend way too much time at the bar. Yes, we have problems with substance abuse, which often stem from deeper mental health issues. And yeah, the constant rain and grey skies don't exactly help. We also have a homelessness problem, which no one seems to know how to tackle. The homeless population is drawn by the social services we offer, but they're just not enough. Our non-homeless residents are torn between sympathy and frustration. In this, we're not so weird after all.",
            "The mountains have been steadfast companions, silently bearing witness to the sun's daily rituals of dawn and dusk. Unchanging and unwavering, they remain unaffected by life's turmoil and tribulations. On days when I'm overwhelmed and stressed, they beckon me to pause and take in their serene beauty, lending me the strength to carry on, one day at a time. I first fell under their spell when I began my university journey, and the mountains north of campus have held a special place in my heart ever since. While the university grounds have their own charms, from the striking buildings to the picturesque ponds and trees, it's the mountains that truly command my affection. The rest of the town is equally captivating, with its numerous cafes that have been the backdrop for countless hours of late-night studying fueled by caffeine. I cherish the memories of strolling or taking the bus to downtown, surrounded by the faded grandeur of old buildings, which blends seamlessly with the vibrant energy of the urban city. Yet, it's easy to retreat from the bustle and return to the tranquil atmosphere of the small town by simply walking past the library. This juxtaposition of contrasting atmospheres has created a unique sense of wonder, as if the town is constantly inviting me to explore its depths. Every memory I've created, whether it's sharing laughter with friends under the rusted swings in the park or rushing through downtown to catch a movie, is tied to a specific part of town. The ponds, however, hold a special significance - they've been a sanctuary for reflection and, at times, a cry for help during my darkest nights of self-doubt. As I sit by the water, watching the turtles, ducks, and insects go about their lives, I'm reminded of my own search for purpose and meaning. I often find myself lost in thought, pondering the mysteries of life, but as I walk past the pond, the park, and the houses, I reach the main street, where the sun's radiance paints the sky with hues of yellow and blue. And there, I'm reminded of the mountains, always present, yet often overlooked. They stand tall, their grandeur a source of inspiration, urging me to persevere.",
            "If you're planning a trip to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you won't have a hard time finding it. The public transportation in New York City is great, making it super easy to get around. Bensonhurst is a pretty urban area, so you'll still get that quintessential New York City vibe during your visit. As you walk around, keep an eye out for the numerous Asian stores that dot the neighborhood. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurst has seen a significant influx of Asian residents, which is reflected in the abundance of Asian-owned stores on almost every block. You'll likely find Asian supermarkets and laundromats in abundance, and the locals love them for their great food quality, affordable prices, and convenience. Just a block away from me, there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk of each other, making grocery shopping a breeze. Of course, Bensonhurst isn't exclusively Asian - it's a melting pot of cultures, with immigrants and their American-born kids calling the neighborhood home. Many of the big businesses in the area are Asian-owned, but you'll also find a beautiful, recently renovated park nearby with plenty of facilities like basketball courts, a soccer/baseball field, handball courts, a playground, and even a water feature for kids to enjoy during the summer. As you'd expect in New York City, the park is a vibrant hub of activity, showcasing the area's diversity in the best possible light. One thing you won't find in abundance in Bensonhurst is corporate skyscrapers - co-op living buildings and condominium apartments are the norm, with many residents living in two-family homes. The people here are generally nice, but be warned: the noise levels can get pretty high, with cars blasting music and speeding down the streets. If you're planning a nighttime visit, be mindful of your surroundings - while the neighborhood is safe, you can never be too careful. I've had my share of run-ins with troublemakers in the past, including a physical altercation and a package theft incident. While it's a common problem, package theft is a concern in this area. One more thing to watch out for: dog owners who don't clean up after their pets. Every morning, you'll likely spot dog waste on the sidewalk or near the train station or supermarket. My pet peeve? Dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be sure to keep your shoes clean!",
            "Lately, I've been noticing that my neighborhood lacks sidewalks, and my house happens to be situated at the top of the steepest hill in the area. Locals have nicknamed it the \"workout hill\" since joggers often use it as part of their daily routine. Due to the absence of sidewalks on my street, everyone walks on the road, which can be hazardous, especially with potholes scattered here and there. The telephone and electric wires around the block appear tattered, and constant storms cause branches and debris to knock down the power lines, necessitating frequent repairs. It's a common sight to see patchwork repairs on these wires. The landscape is dominated by tall evergreen trees, but residents tend to cut them down to preserve the ocean view. Many houses are built with large glass-fronted second stories to take in the breathtaking view of the bay. Watching the sunset is a treat, with the water getting lit up from below, and the sky turning orange. However, most days are overcast, resulting in a damp atmosphere and a lot of haze. Moss grows profusely on everything, including roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked for a month, and when I returned, it was a green, moss-covered mess that took three hours to clean off. Our neighborhood is relatively quiet, with not many children around, except for a school a short distance away. Mostly retired people reside in our area, and instead of kids, you often see dogs roaming the streets or racing each other. They're quite common in our neighborhood, and if you leave a door or window open, you risk having them sneak into your house. I once found one in my living room and had to shoo it out the front door. Rabbits are also abundant in the area, and while they can be a nuisance to gardeners as they dig up plant roots and burrow into lawns, my cats enjoy hunting them. We also have our fair share of birds, including small sparrows, hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle that swoops by before being chased away by crows. If you're willing to hike downhill to the waterfront, you can find a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. The shoreline isn't extensive, but the rocks along the shore are fun to throw into the water. The bay is relatively narrow, and on most days, you can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist.",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area in a small town in Tennessee, surrounded by state highways that bring a moderate amount of traffic to our quiet street. Our neighborhood is generally stable, with not many new residents moving in, so I've gotten accustomed to knowing most of my neighbors. Daily life revolves around yard work and daily routines. In winter, we enjoy sledding down the hill on our side street, and since our house is located at the front of our street, we have a clear view of everyone passing by. We're always on the lookout for unfamiliar vehicles. Some neighbors take walks for exercise or to walk their dogs, while kids can be seen riding their bikes. We spend most of our time at home working from our house, with my wife and our two daughters – aged eleven and fourteen – keeping me company. As a result, everyone in the neighborhood is familiar with our coming and going. We're not ones to shy away from spending time outdoors, even on rainy days. Occasionally, we fire up the barbecue on our back deck, filling the air with a pleasant smell. The sound of lawn mowers is a regular occurrence from March to October, a reminder that our neighborhood was once a wooded area and still retains its lush tree cover. This brings a lot of shade, but also a lot of leaves in the fall, requiring us to rake and burn them annually. I must admit, I enjoy the smell of burning leaves, a sure sign that fall has arrived. Lately, the lack of winter has made the season feel like a prolonged fall. Our garage, located at the back of our house, sees minimal use, except when I'm working on my truck or other projects, which allows me to stay connected to the neighborhood. Holidays are generally quiet, with occasional visits from out-of-town family members during Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, and Christmas, resulting in an influx of cars on our street. Overall, I'm content with living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be an ideal neighborhood.",
            "My home is situated smack in the middle of a high desert landscape, where dirt and dust seem to rule supreme. Anyone who hasn't experienced living here wouldn't grasp the perpetual sight of brown hues and the sense of awe when spotting a lawn, which is usually a result of extensive maintenance. When I first moved here in the 90s, houses were scattered far and wide, giving it a more secluded feel. Although it's not much different now, with new developments sprouting up, our neighborhood is slowly transforming into a bustling urban area, just like many other places. The people here are generally friendly, but, like any city, it has its share of good and not-so-good aspects. I've been fortunate to be surrounded by kind-hearted elderly folks, making my neighborhood a more pleasant place to live. Our local stores are mostly chains, such as Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you're craving fresh produce, you'll have to venture out. The dominant industries in my city appear to be construction, as there's still plenty of open space left to be developed. This prospect unsettles me a bit, as I prefer things as they are. I left behind the hustle and bustle of a big city and don't want to go back. Speaking of construction, my job as a drywall and T-bar installer is located in this very field. What I appreciate about my home is the diverse wildlife. The high desert is a magnet for visitors, not just for its breathtaking beauty but also for the unique ecosystems it supports. It's essential for human residents to learn about the non-human inhabitants of this environment to coexist peacefully and responsibly. My family and I have grown accustomed to the local wildlife, and my kids are particularly fond of lizards and desert insects. As I write this, they're outside trying to catch various specimens. When it comes to attractions, we have a few notable ones. Victorville is an excellent destination for families looking to experience the desert. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with the San Bernardino County Fair, which offers an unforgettable experience with a mix of activities and fun. Visit nearby Wrightwood to witness the snow-capped mountains and take part in winter sports to cap off your visit. For those interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem, the Victor Valley Museum is a must-visit, featuring geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of Victorville's development and growth.",
            "When people ask me to describe my neighborhood, I give answers that are, in a way, quite distinct. You see, my neighbors aren't just the folks who live next door, but the people I share my college campus with. The dormitory I stay in is my community, and the surrounding campus is my neighborhood too, albeit to a lesser degree. Now, you might think my situation's a bit unusual, but my neighborhood still shares some common traits with what you'd expect from a typical neighborhood. It's got houses, people, stores, and parks – the basics, really. Let's start with the \"houses\" in my neighborhood, although they're a bit different from what you'd find elsewhere. In my neck of the woods, we've got three types of housing: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory houses. First off, the apartments usually have 2-4 people sharing a room, with 4-6 rooms per floor, and about 20 people living in each building on average. Then there are the actual houses, which are mostly 2-4 bedroom setups rented by alumni, but there aren't many of those around. Last but not least, we've got the dorm rooms, which are the most common type of housing here, with two people sharing a room, except in some cases. With housing covered, let's move on to the people. My school's all about being diverse, and that's reflected in my neighborhood's makeup. We've got people from all walks of life and cultures living here, with the professional staff in the houses, new students in the dorms, and older students in the apartments. Talking about the people here would take too long, so let's skip to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. As my school is basically a self-contained neighborhood, we've got plenty of stores and a single park. The stores offer a mix of regular dining options and the school's own brand of clothing and grocery stores, so you can find everything you need within our neighborhood boundaries. Our park is a playground for all the diverse folks in my neighborhood, kept clean and safe thanks to everyone's efforts.",
            "I've been living in this neighborhood for about 10 years now, so I guess I can share some of my experiences. When I first moved here from Riverdale to Stockbridge, I was really down in the dumps. I cried because I missed my old place and the people there, but my parents wanted the best for my little sister and me, so we had to move to a better area with a nicer house and a better school. Looking back, it was a tough transition, but I slowly got used to it and made some new friends and acquaintances in school. I didn't really get to know my neighbors that well, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis, who lived right next door. They've been like family to me over the years, and I'm grateful for their presence in my life. I still remember the time I went to Mr. Glen's wedding - it was a blast, and I'm looking forward to having a similar celebration when I get married someday and can give my future wife the life she deserves. At the wedding, I was lucky enough to catch the little strap that Ms. Veda threw off her leg, but unfortunately, I missed the flowers. I had a great time dancing with Marsharii, Mr. Glen's daughter, but I haven't seen her since. I hope she's doing well and achieving her goals. This neighborhood can be confusing, but with the help of GPS, I've been able to explore it more. I've hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis, and we used to spend hours playing video games and just enjoying life. Sometimes I'd go to the park and connect with nature, which helps calm me down and brings me a sense of peace. I also like to visit the park and practice my balance with sticks I bought from Home Depot, and I sometimes bring my bokken wooden sword along. I enjoy doing what I love. There are also a basketball and tennis court nearby, although I haven't played in a while, it's nice to know they're there in case I want to pick it up again. My dad used to take me and my best friend to play tennis with Mr. Graves, and we always had a great time, even though they pushed us hard. I've had a lot of fun in this neighborhood, and there are plenty of stories to share, but these are the ones that really stand out to me. I'm excited to see what the future holds.",
            "Living in my neighborhood is pretty ideal for me because it's just a short walk to the college I attend. Most of the apartments around me are decently priced, and there are some affordable bars and restaurants nearby that I enjoy going to. However, one of the bars just got a new name and seems to be priced a bit higher, but the quality of service and drinks is still good. The crowd is generally nice, consisting of college students and low-income residents. The area is also quite family-friendly, with an elementary school nearby that's within walking distance. I don't really know my neighbors, but I'm a bit amused by how they often smoke weed - the management even installed an air freshener unit in front of their door, which my boyfriend and I found quite funny. It's almost like they're being mocked. The buildings in my area are mostly old but have been renovated inside. Down the street, there are some brand new apartments, but I'm not a fan because I heard the construction wasn't great and the rent is still quite high. I think it's a scam, but since they're close to campus, the management gets away with it. There's a super cheap restaurant nearby that serves food on paper plates and microwaves most of their dishes. Across from it is a gas station that's not exactly a great place to work. Thanks to some city funding, the road was repaved last summer, making it look a bit nicer with a big sidewalk and lots of grass. However, my apartment building is surrounded by a lot of trees, which I think is nice. They've cut down a few, but there are still plenty more than in the surrounding areas. Behind my building is a tree line and another apartment complex. The street behind mine is 43rd, and it's not as nice as 42nd where I live. The sidewalks are in bad shape, and most of the buildings look run-down. The street is lined with trees, but it's probably just to hide the state of the buildings. There have been some issues with crime in the area, particularly at an apartment complex on 43rd, but I don't think it's entirely their fault. There are other apartments across from me with similar problems and a transient population. Despite this, I like living here because it's affordable and convenient, with the university nearby and two bus stops for easy access to the store and downtown.",
            "I live in a neighborhood with a unique charm. It's made up of identical-looking duplexes on a cul-de-sac, each painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. The friendly vibe is palpable, with most neighbors getting along and even chatting with each other on their driveways in the evenings. It's a refreshing escape from the digital world we're often immersed in, like stepping back in time. We're surrounded by lush fields, trees, and the vast blue sky with puffy white clouds, creating a serene atmosphere. However, this season brought some unexpected challenges – tornado warnings and actual sirens that forced us to seek shelter. I was right there in my bathtub, clutching my little dog and my purse, while my bigger dog stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The neighborhood was eerily quiet, except for the sound of hail pounding the ground. As the storm passed, the temperature dropped drastically, causing the road to steam up. The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement, and as I looked up, a beautiful double rainbow appeared in the sky. I quickly grabbed my camera and snapped some amazing shots to share with my friends and family on Facebook. They were just as amazed as I was. The streets remained quiet for a while until people returned home, and then it was back to normal – kids playing outside while their parents cooked dinner. I'm so grateful to have found this lovely neighborhood, especially after moving from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I adore the Southern accent and the friendly people. My two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment might look the same as the others on the outside, but each one has its unique interior. Some are surprisingly small, and I'm still trying to figure out why. I love taking long walks through the big field behind my home and strolling down to the pond, where I often spot deer and listen to the enchanting song of the bullfrog. It's a great place to live, just 40 minutes outside Charlotte. Every morning starts with the sweet sound of roosters crowing from the nearby farms, giving me a sense of living in a small village community. Even the nearby farm has a lovable donkey that brays in the evening to remind us he's there. I feel so lucky to have found this gem of a neighborhood.",
            "My family and I moved into this neighborhood a little while before I started eighth grade. It took some time for me to adjust and make friends, but I ended up becoming close to two neighbours, one of whom lives just two doors down from me and the other on the same street. Unfortunately, they're no longer living here now, but the memories we made are still vivid. The people who've been here since I first moved in are still around, which is nice. My neighbourhood is pretty typical, with rows of two-story houses, and every weekend when the weather's warm, you can hear kids playing outside. It's usually pretty quiet here most weekdays, though. I've never had any issues with my neighbours, and I feel comfortable trusting them. I've ordered plenty of packages online and never had one go missing from my porch. There's a park about a minute's walk from my house, where I have lots of fond memories. I used to play basketball, football, and baseball with the other guys in the neighbourhood, but one of my worst memories is also from there – I got elbowed in the nose while playing football! Despite that, the good times far outweigh the bad. Nowadays, when I visit the park, it's usually to spend time with my cousin's younger kids. They love playing on the swings and slides, and it brings a smile to my face seeing them have so much fun. The park holds a special place in my heart, and every time I go there, I'm filled with nostalgia. \n\nMy neighbourhood is pretty diverse, with loads of different food options nearby. Within a one-mile radius, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, with the rise of food delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash, many people just order in instead of going out. The most popular spots are usually the fast food chains, which are common in most suburban neighbourhoods. There are plenty of pizza places too. The local stores have everything you could need, including multiple dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store – a popular chain in the Midwest. Some of the stores even cater to specific tastes, like an Indian-owned shop where you can buy ingredients for homemade Indian dishes or ready-made food. Overall, I'm really happy with my neighbourhood. When I see the horror stories on social media and the news about people's experiences with their neighbours, I feel grateful for mine.",
            "My neighborhood is a humble little town in South Carolina. It may not stand out, but it has a significant impact on the region's agriculture. Johnston proudly claims to be the Peach Capital of the World, and this pride is reflected on the town's welcoming sign. The town is mainly composed of farmland with peach trees and cattle dominating the landscape. Houses are scattered, with most being two-story homes featuring either metal or gray roofs to combat the scorching summer heat. Those situated outside the main part of town are often farther back from the road, allowing for the front fields to be used for animals and crops. The main part of town is marked by a single four-way stop light, where you'll find the town's only stores. For those craving convenience food, there's Hong Kong, a family-run Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, but it sadly closed down not too long ago. You'll also find Maxwell and Halford Drug, a small family-owned pharmacy famous for their Cherry Coca-Cola. A small, but pricey grocery store called IGA is the town's only supermarket, but many residents prefer to visit the Walmart in nearby Batesburg-Leesville for their grocery needs. The most popular store in town, however, is Dollar General, which sells a wide range of everyday essentials and is always bustling from opening to closing time. There's also Possibilities Furniture & More, a cozy furniture store run by a well-known local woman who hires movers to deliver purchased items. Next door to the furniture store is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a small pet groomers offering various services like daycare, boarding, and grooming. Both the doctor's and veterinary practice are situated outside the main part of town, but they're both well-equipped to serve the community. Johnston Elementary School is the town's only school, and students attend middle and high school in the neighboring town after completing fifth grade. Although there aren't many parks or entertainment options, the town is currently developing a 2.5-acre recreational area to provide families with more opportunities for outdoor activities and attract new residents. Despite its simplicity, Johnston is a charming town that can easily go unnoticed in the blink of an eye.",
            "The first time I heard about my area, I was tuning into a podcast about people who had vanished. It caught me off guard, as almost every apartment in the neighborhood was being sold for over $1000 a month. I had never heard anything about it, nor had any of my friends. I guess that's what happens when you're struggling. I know a few of my friends have trouble sleeping at night because things are just so expensive. But we've learned to be frugal over the years. You start to get used to the smell of flea market toys and old clothes that have been tucked away for a while. You smell less in adulthood, and you might even start smoking or just get used to things being a certain way. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty old magazines stacked on an old piano, and it gets stuck in the leather even after you wash it. Our neighborhood has three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start from the far side, you can visit two charity shops, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curio shop. Downtown is crowded, with cars and people everywhere in the morning, but you wouldn't know it in the thrift stores. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the stores are always quiet. It's a great place to waste an afternoon. Every year, there are more and more cars and people flooding the city. It's developing, they say. One of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery calls it home, and it's still showing signs of growth. It reminds me of New York. Everyone's got their own goals, and nobody really bothers you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep your shell as long as you want, and the city will just roll with it. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have more of a community of friends than a bunch of strangers living in an apartment. We come together for birthdays, funerals, and when we need each other. In some ways, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors, and they treat me pretty well. I try to keep my apartment clean and leave them food, and they do the same for me. We exchange mail and it's nice to see them. I think they enjoy my presence just as much as I do theirs. Despite living in a massive, impersonal modernist sprawl, it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't completely mess up my life.",
            "My neighborhood is a classic example of cookie cutter suburbia. I live in an area where the presence of a homeowner's association is strongly felt. As soon as you step in, you'll notice rows of perfectly maintained single-family homes, thanks to the HOA. The front yards are surprisingly uniform, with a small patch of grass, decorative pebbles, and short driveways. Every now and then, you'll spot a small tree or two. It's also common to see two-car garages on most homes. The roads are immaculate, with newly paved concrete and no potholes in sight. While the majority of houses are single-story, a few have two stories. One thing that stands out is the unique mailbox system. Instead of having individual mailboxes in front of each house, we have a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street, which requires a key to access your specific box. There are also two larger lockers for packages, all thanks to the HOA's emphasis on uniformity. Our neighborhood is situated on the outskirts of the nearby city, making it a mix of rural and suburban living. As a result, we have plenty of space for various amenities. There are multiple community pools, all well-maintained and gated, where anyone living here can swim. We also have walking trails where you can take your dog for a walk or enjoy an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get some exercise; simply running around the neighborhood will suffice.\n\nThe community is predominantly made up of retirees, who make up a significant portion of the residents. It's an extremely safe area, with everyone looking out for one another. Mixed in with the retirees are a few middle-aged and young professionals. Our city is surprisingly large in terms of population but has a small-town feel. We have all the amenities you'd expect, including a single mall that may not be huge but gets the job done. It takes me around 15 minutes to drive to any major destination, but once I arrive, I'm greeted with a variety of stores to choose from. We have high-end grocery stores with organic options to bargain outlets with limited selection and minimal staff to keep costs low. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have many nice amenities like pools and walking trails, and while we're not right next door to shopping, it's just a short drive to get to any major chain store.",
            "I reside in a small Midwestern town just on the outskirts of a major city, nestled in the suburbs. My neighborhood, situated on the east side, is considered one of the economically disadvantaged areas of the town. The property values are relatively low, with many houses being rented or owned by families with lower incomes. Yet, it's not an uninviting place. My neighbors are generally friendly folks who greet me with a smile when I walk down the street. Although the crime rates are slightly higher than in other parts of town, they're still manageable. Over the past decade, there have been some violent incidents, including a few shootings and a homicide, within a few blocks of my home. I recall our next-door neighbors losing their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Thankfully, our family hasn't been directly affected by crime, except for the occasional missing item from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. Our town has been significantly impacted by the \"opioid epidemic\" that has affected many parts of the United States. However, there are various resources available to combat this issue, including rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those struggling with addiction. Despite these challenges, our town has many appealing qualities. My son's elementary school boasts an excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. He has not faced any bullying, thanks to the positive atmosphere of the school, and he genuinely enjoys attending. We have an active PTO that organizes numerous events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Given that over 20% of our town's population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. No child or family is treated as inferior due to financial constraints, and the costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are relatively low. The City Council and staff have made efforts to improve our town's appearance, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side, where I reside, tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for my neighbors and me. Overall, I appreciate living in this town. People are generally kind, the schools are excellent, there are sufficient shopping options to meet our needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it's comfortable and suitable. We've lived here for over 16 years, and it's hard to imagine calling anywhere else home.",
            "My neighborhood is a melting pot of culture, perched on a hill amidst a cluster of buildings steeped in history. I reside in a 7-story apartment building, directly opposite the old theater, and just a block away is this charming arcade bar that attracts a diverse crowd on warm summer evenings. On weekends in June and July, a long queue often forms outside its doors. Just a few blocks up is the city's nearest park, a sprawling green space considering its location in this part of town. The park is surrounded by concrete, with tall stairs carved into the wall. During the harsh winter months, homeless people set up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and the wide steps. This strategic placement keeps them relatively warmer, despite the lack of snow, and allows them easy access to the nearby family center, where they can bathe and shower. What I cherish about my city, though, isn't its historic architecture or the grand buildings that dot the hillsides. It's the community that truly makes it special. You see, Hilltop was once notorious for gang violence on the West Coast. Even decades later, stories of the federal government and DEA swooping in to clean up the streets still circulate. The people haven't forgotten. These stories are passed down through generations, from the original residents to newcomers like me, as a reminder of the neighborhood's rough past. Despite its reputation, the community works hard to maintain its cleanliness and care about what goes on in their city and on their block. They even caution outsiders not to venture out after dark, a warning that still carries the weight of its troubled history. As a 'not-quite-white' girl, I feel a connection to this community. Perhaps it's because I'm dark enough to blend in, or maybe Hilltop has accepted me as one of their own, someone who's aware of the ingrained racism and biases that plague our society. I know one thing: Hilltop will always be my home. I feel alive strolling through the streets at night, surrounded by people who've shown me kindness and empathy more often than not. It's a place where laundromats stay open late to let me charge my phone when I'm caught in the rain, and where strangers have handed me money and told me I'm beautiful and valuable, even when I felt invisible.",
            "I live in the heart of Rural America, nestled in the quaint town of Michigan. My home is surrounded by the picturesque beauty of farmland and charming tourist cities. Life here is simple, with no big city malls, chain stores like Wal-mart or Target, or restaurants like Applebee's within reach. You have to drive to get anywhere, but the journey is worth it, as I'm blessed to live in one of the most breathtaking places on earth, surrounded by two magnificent lakes - Lake Michigan to the one side and Lake Charlevoix to the other. Every corner of our small town offers a serene beach to dip your toes in, making it a haven for those seeking tranquility. My neighborhood is a classic example of small-town living, with houses that reflect the essence of Middle America. These aren't cookie-cutter homes, but rather unique, older residences that have been lovingly updated and remodeled over the years. Many of these homes boast basements, some of which are fully-fledged and open to the eye from the street. The neighborhood is a kaleidoscope of colors, with houses painted in every hue imaginable. Most homes have spacious yards, complete with trampolines, playsets, gardens, and fences for pets. Our community is comprised of hardworking individuals who strive to make a living and raise their families. On any given day, you'll see kids playing in the streets, people strolling their dogs, biking, or rollerblading. Neighbors know one another, and it's not uncommon to see a friendly wave or a smile from a passerby. The lawns are meticulously maintained, with green grass and well-trimmed plants adding to the neighborhood's charm. While it may not be the most stunning neighborhood you've ever seen, it's one that exudes a sense of belonging and a promise of a safe haven. Within walking distance, you'll find the county sheriff's department, the health department, and the recycling center, all of which serve our community. Our small town is also home to baseball and softball fields, where you can hear the excitement of the game, and a nearby airport where small planes take off and land. You can stroll to the local ice cream parlor, and if you're feeling adventurous, take a short walk downtown. The best part? My kids can ride their bikes to the nearby park, just 8 blocks away. It's a wonderful place to call home."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "Living in a big city like mine, I've got a pretty diverse neighborhood. House areas are scattered around commercial areas, which are filled with various shops, offices, restaurants, and entertainment spots. You can easily find new places to eat or shop at, with a mix of big brands and small boutiques popping up everywhere. Some boutiques line the streets, often just a short walk away from quiet neighborhoods that would be peaceful if not for all the things to see and do. We've also got a few parks nearby, and I've noticed that people often take their kids there. As for the people, my neighborhood has its fair share of diversity. There's even a small area with a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a group of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. If you venture a bit further out, you'll find even more people of different races and origins, often grouped together in their own mini-communities within the city. Places like Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia are just a few miles away, but getting there can take a while due to the crazy traffic. It's a big city, and most people prefer not to walk anywhere - only a few miles can turn into a two-hour drive during rush hour. To make matters worse, we've got some of the worst traffic in the world, and parking spots are hard to come by. On top of that, there's been a lot of construction lately, with new apartment buildings springing up everywhere. Some people are happy about the growth, but many are worried about the extra crowds and traffic. As for housing, we've got a mix of big apartment buildings, houses of all sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condos. Some properties have single-family homes, while others have duplexes. Even in my immediate neighborhood, you can find all sorts of housing options. The same goes for the people living here - we've got a wide range of ages, and I don't even know most of my neighbors. It's not as tight-knit a community as it used to be when I was a kid, but I do have some fond memories of playing with my next-door neighbor and a few other friends from back in the day.",
            "My neighborhood is a sight to behold. Most of the homes here are single-family dwellings, but there are a few that have been divided into two separate units, while still sharing a common wall. My house has a small front yard and a driveway to the left, just like most of the others. It's a nostalgic sight, reminiscent of a time not so long ago when the suburbs were the epitome of the American dream. Although that dream has lost its allure for some, my neighborhood remains a testament to its enduring appeal. The people here don't radiate the same optimism they once did, and the upkeep of the lawns has suffered, but there are still cars parked in every driveway, and the youth still play with abandon, as if nothing's changed. The local public school, which has been around for almost 90 years, still stands tall, giving the kids a glimpse of the future, while transporting the older residents back to a bygone era. The churches are few and far between, but the basketball courts are still bustling with activity. Despite the varying appearances of the homes, they all feel the same. There's a large supermarket called Super \"A\", owned by a Yemeni family, who are possibly the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The majority of residents, however, are African American. The streets are wide and spacious, and the kids usually play football, giving way to passing cars. Most people in my neighborhood have lived here for generations, and they can recall a time when everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school, but when the karate kid movies fell out of favor, the kids lost interest, so it's now a pharmacy, as everyone seems to think that medication can cure anything. There's also a small movie theater that shows old movies at a discounted price, which seems to please the older folks, who think it's a small price to pay for an evening out, minus the kids, of course. Our town is connected to the next one by a single expressway, but the entrance and exit are actually in the adjacent town. There was once a petition to get an exit in our town, but the youth supported it, while the older residents opposed it, fearing that the expressway would ruin our town. They managed to persuade the city council to reject the proposal. We're currently building a new high school, and we're still deciding on a mascot for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the perfect representation of our town.",
            "At first glance, this place may not seem like much - a residential area behind a shopping strip that's easy to overlook. It's not the kind of place that jumps out at you as having much to offer. But, if you take a walk behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and head back behind the hotels that are only occupied for part of the year, you'll stumble upon a thriving community. The streets here are lined with a row of apartment complexes, each one carefully situated next to the others like a series of connected puzzle pieces. These aren't the kind of places you'd expect to find in an area like this, but they're actually a world unto themselves that most people who live here don't even know about. Across the street from these complexes is a community college campus - a set of quiet, sleepy buildings that seem almost out of place alongside the bustling road. Students shuffle in, yawning and clutching their coffee, on their way to start their day at 7 am. The iron gates creak open to let them in, while commuters behind the wheel mutter and shake their fists in frustration when they get stuck behind them. Further down the road, another residential street intersects, lined with a park and a rehabilitation center for people with broken bones. The treatment center has a cheerful, welcoming atmosphere, with a lazy ceiling fan spinning gently above and a porch full of furniture. Children play in the park across the street, laughing and running through the grass while bees flit lazily around the flowers. Retirees walk their dogs on the walking path, shaking their heads at the teenagers on skateboards but smiling at the teenage girls gossiping by the playground equipment. A sushi place in a strip mall near the park has affordable food but never seems to be busy, while a swimming supply store and nail salon are right next door. You could fill your pool for the season, get a manicure, and enjoy some hibachi chicken all in one go - the kind of convenience that's hard to find. There's even a frozen yogurt shop where you can grab a treat while watching the teens do tricks on their skateboards and vape. This neighborhood is a slice of quintessential America, a piece of history in the sleepy south where time itself seems to stand still.",
            "As we cruised down the winding road lined with endless cornfields, my friend gazed out at the seemingly endless landscape. \"Where are we?\" she asked, taken aback by the vast open spaces. I smiled knowingly, anticipating her shock at the stark difference from the bustling town she was used to, where the grocery store was just a stone's throw away from her doorstep. Growing up in a small town in rural Ohio, I was familiar with this kind of scenery, and I shared my own experiences with her. In that moment, she finally grasped who I was and where I came from.\n\nAs we continued down the two-lane road, a tranquil quarry came into view, its calm waters reflecting the sky above. Just beyond it lay the quaint development where I lived, a collection of brick and stucco homes that each boasted a generous half-acre plot, lovingly tended by their owners. During spring, vibrant flowers bloomed alongside the region's iconic midwestern trees, their changing leaves a constant reminder of the passing seasons. The driveways were a sight to behold, lined with sleek Mercedes-Benz luxury cars that glistened in the sunlight after a refreshing wash. My friendly Korean neighbor, a constant presence in our community, could often be found tending to his lawn, his cheerful humming a stark contrast to the whirring of his John Deere mower.\n\nAs we approached my home, a grey stucco house nestled among the trees, the sounds of the outdoors grew louder – the occasional honk of a goose, the chirping of birds, and the soothing hum of the nearby stream. The Terrier, ever vigilant, chased after the geese in the side yard, while the bullfrogs and the occasional \"moo\" from the nearby farms added to the symphony of sounds. A handmade wooden bridge spanned the small stream, leading to a hidden oasis teeming with wildflowers, herbs, and naturally growing trees – a sanctuary where I spent countless hours as a child. From building tree forts to \"hunting\" animals (which mostly involved chasing them), there was never a dull moment, and I was always surrounded by friends from the neighborhood.\n\nIn the harsh winters, our small town transformed into a winter wonderland. The once-vibrant trees stood bare, their branches etched against the grey sky like skeletal fingers. But when snow fell, the backyard was transformed into a magical landscape of snow angels and snowmen, crafted by my mischievous little sister and me. We'd engage in fierce snowball fights, our arsenal of branches and sticks at the ready, and construct elaborate forts to house our winter wonderland. In those carefree days, nothing else mattered – just the joy of childhood, untainted by the complexities of adulthood.",
            "You gotta understand what being \"weird\" means in Portland, Oregon. The unofficial town motto, scribbled on a building that's a pizza joint, bar, music venue, and strip club all rolled into one, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, it's a nostalgic call to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a time when the city was less known, less expensive, and birthed unique subcultures. Others see it as a welcoming invitation - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but this time as a compliment. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the never-ending construction of new condos to house them, Portland remains weird. Being weird doesn't mean we're always accepting, but it does mean we're open to things that others might not be. We're not a place without modern conveniences or modern problems - we buy most of our stuff from China, just like everyone else. Being weird can mean a million different things, but in Portland, there's also plenty of normalcy. We have yoga, hipsters, and suits, just like any other city. Maybe weird just means we don't take ourselves too seriously. In my neighborhood, it's not uncommon to see colorful houses, home gardens overflowing with flowers, herbs, and veggies, and free boxes lining the streets in the summer. Free boxes contain all sorts of treasures - clothes, books, or anything else someone's getting rid of. Sometimes, they're magical, containing just the thing you need. That's what Portland is all about to me - the thrill of discovering something amazing on a random walk through a Southeast Portland neighborhood. Of course, I'm just one of the many weirdos who call this city home. Some of my neighbors would never be caught dead rummaging through a free box on the sidewalk. They'd rather go to goat yoga or catch a Timbers game (that's the city's soccer team). Portland's full of people who love all sorts of things, from unusual hobbies to wild ambitions. We're a city of dreamers, and dreamers who spend way too much time at the bar. Yes, we have problems with substance abuse, which often stem from deeper mental health issues. And yeah, the constant rain and grey skies don't exactly help. We also have a homelessness problem, which no one seems to know how to tackle. The homeless population is drawn by the social services we offer, but they're just not enough. Our non-homeless residents are torn between sympathy and frustration. In this, we're not so weird after all.",
            "The mountains have been steadfast companions, silently bearing witness to the sun's daily rituals of dawn and dusk. Unchanging and unwavering, they remain unaffected by life's turmoil and tribulations. On days when I'm overwhelmed and stressed, they beckon me to pause and take in their serene beauty, lending me the strength to carry on, one day at a time. I first fell under their spell when I began my university journey, and the mountains north of campus have held a special place in my heart ever since. While the university grounds have their own charms, from the striking buildings to the picturesque ponds and trees, it's the mountains that truly command my affection. The rest of the town is equally captivating, with its numerous cafes that have been the backdrop for countless hours of late-night studying fueled by caffeine. I cherish the memories of strolling or taking the bus to downtown, surrounded by the faded grandeur of old buildings, which blends seamlessly with the vibrant energy of the urban city. Yet, it's easy to retreat from the bustle and return to the tranquil atmosphere of the small town by simply walking past the library. This juxtaposition of contrasting atmospheres has created a unique sense of wonder, as if the town is constantly inviting me to explore its depths. Every memory I've created, whether it's sharing laughter with friends under the rusted swings in the park or rushing through downtown to catch a movie, is tied to a specific part of town. The ponds, however, hold a special significance - they've been a sanctuary for reflection and, at times, a cry for help during my darkest nights of self-doubt. As I sit by the water, watching the turtles, ducks, and insects go about their lives, I'm reminded of my own search for purpose and meaning. I often find myself lost in thought, pondering the mysteries of life, but as I walk past the pond, the park, and the houses, I reach the main street, where the sun's radiance paints the sky with hues of yellow and blue. And there, I'm reminded of the mountains, always present, yet often overlooked. They stand tall, their grandeur a source of inspiration, urging me to persevere.",
            "If you're planning a trip to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you won't have a hard time finding it. The public transportation in New York City is great, making it super easy to get around. Bensonhurst is a pretty urban area, so you'll still get that quintessential New York City vibe during your visit. As you walk around, keep an eye out for the numerous Asian stores that dot the neighborhood. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurst has seen a significant influx of Asian residents, which is reflected in the abundance of Asian-owned stores on almost every block. You'll likely find Asian supermarkets and laundromats in abundance, and the locals love them for their great food quality, affordable prices, and convenience. Just a block away from me, there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk of each other, making grocery shopping a breeze. Of course, Bensonhurst isn't exclusively Asian - it's a melting pot of cultures, with immigrants and their American-born kids calling the neighborhood home. Many of the big businesses in the area are Asian-owned, but you'll also find a beautiful, recently renovated park nearby with plenty of facilities like basketball courts, a soccer/baseball field, handball courts, a playground, and even a water feature for kids to enjoy during the summer. As you'd expect in New York City, the park is a vibrant hub of activity, showcasing the area's diversity in the best possible light. One thing you won't find in abundance in Bensonhurst is corporate skyscrapers - co-op living buildings and condominium apartments are the norm, with many residents living in two-family homes. The people here are generally nice, but be warned: the noise levels can get pretty high, with cars blasting music and speeding down the streets. If you're planning a nighttime visit, be mindful of your surroundings - while the neighborhood is safe, you can never be too careful. I've had my share of run-ins with troublemakers in the past, including a physical altercation and a package theft incident. While it's a common problem, package theft is a concern in this area. One more thing to watch out for: dog owners who don't clean up after their pets. Every morning, you'll likely spot dog waste on the sidewalk or near the train station or supermarket. My pet peeve? Dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be sure to keep your shoes clean!",
            "Lately, I've been noticing that my neighborhood lacks sidewalks, and my house happens to be situated at the top of the steepest hill in the area. Locals have nicknamed it the \"workout hill\" since joggers often use it as part of their daily routine. Due to the absence of sidewalks on my street, everyone walks on the road, which can be hazardous, especially with potholes scattered here and there. The telephone and electric wires around the block appear tattered, and constant storms cause branches and debris to knock down the power lines, necessitating frequent repairs. It's a common sight to see patchwork repairs on these wires. The landscape is dominated by tall evergreen trees, but residents tend to cut them down to preserve the ocean view. Many houses are built with large glass-fronted second stories to take in the breathtaking view of the bay. Watching the sunset is a treat, with the water getting lit up from below, and the sky turning orange. However, most days are overcast, resulting in a damp atmosphere and a lot of haze. Moss grows profusely on everything, including roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked for a month, and when I returned, it was a green, moss-covered mess that took three hours to clean off. Our neighborhood is relatively quiet, with not many children around, except for a school a short distance away. Mostly retired people reside in our area, and instead of kids, you often see dogs roaming the streets or racing each other. They're quite common in our neighborhood, and if you leave a door or window open, you risk having them sneak into your house. I once found one in my living room and had to shoo it out the front door. Rabbits are also abundant in the area, and while they can be a nuisance to gardeners as they dig up plant roots and burrow into lawns, my cats enjoy hunting them. We also have our fair share of birds, including small sparrows, hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle that swoops by before being chased away by crows. If you're willing to hike downhill to the waterfront, you can find a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. The shoreline isn't extensive, but the rocks along the shore are fun to throw into the water. The bay is relatively narrow, and on most days, you can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist.",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area in a small town in Tennessee, surrounded by state highways that bring a moderate amount of traffic to our quiet street. Our neighborhood is generally stable, with not many new residents moving in, so I've gotten accustomed to knowing most of my neighbors. Daily life revolves around yard work and daily routines. In winter, we enjoy sledding down the hill on our side street, and since our house is located at the front of our street, we have a clear view of everyone passing by. We're always on the lookout for unfamiliar vehicles. Some neighbors take walks for exercise or to walk their dogs, while kids can be seen riding their bikes. We spend most of our time at home working from our house, with my wife and our two daughters – aged eleven and fourteen – keeping me company. As a result, everyone in the neighborhood is familiar with our coming and going. We're not ones to shy away from spending time outdoors, even on rainy days. Occasionally, we fire up the barbecue on our back deck, filling the air with a pleasant smell. The sound of lawn mowers is a regular occurrence from March to October, a reminder that our neighborhood was once a wooded area and still retains its lush tree cover. This brings a lot of shade, but also a lot of leaves in the fall, requiring us to rake and burn them annually. I must admit, I enjoy the smell of burning leaves, a sure sign that fall has arrived. Lately, the lack of winter has made the season feel like a prolonged fall. Our garage, located at the back of our house, sees minimal use, except when I'm working on my truck or other projects, which allows me to stay connected to the neighborhood. Holidays are generally quiet, with occasional visits from out-of-town family members during Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, and Christmas, resulting in an influx of cars on our street. Overall, I'm content with living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be an ideal neighborhood.",
            "My home is situated smack in the middle of a high desert landscape, where dirt and dust seem to rule supreme. Anyone who hasn't experienced living here wouldn't grasp the perpetual sight of brown hues and the sense of awe when spotting a lawn, which is usually a result of extensive maintenance. When I first moved here in the 90s, houses were scattered far and wide, giving it a more secluded feel. Although it's not much different now, with new developments sprouting up, our neighborhood is slowly transforming into a bustling urban area, just like many other places. The people here are generally friendly, but, like any city, it has its share of good and not-so-good aspects. I've been fortunate to be surrounded by kind-hearted elderly folks, making my neighborhood a more pleasant place to live. Our local stores are mostly chains, such as Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you're craving fresh produce, you'll have to venture out. The dominant industries in my city appear to be construction, as there's still plenty of open space left to be developed. This prospect unsettles me a bit, as I prefer things as they are. I left behind the hustle and bustle of a big city and don't want to go back. Speaking of construction, my job as a drywall and T-bar installer is located in this very field. What I appreciate about my home is the diverse wildlife. The high desert is a magnet for visitors, not just for its breathtaking beauty but also for the unique ecosystems it supports. It's essential for human residents to learn about the non-human inhabitants of this environment to coexist peacefully and responsibly. My family and I have grown accustomed to the local wildlife, and my kids are particularly fond of lizards and desert insects. As I write this, they're outside trying to catch various specimens. When it comes to attractions, we have a few notable ones. Victorville is an excellent destination for families looking to experience the desert. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with the San Bernardino County Fair, which offers an unforgettable experience with a mix of activities and fun. Visit nearby Wrightwood to witness the snow-capped mountains and take part in winter sports to cap off your visit. For those interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem, the Victor Valley Museum is a must-visit, featuring geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of Victorville's development and growth.",
            "When people ask me to describe my neighborhood, I give answers that are, in a way, quite distinct. You see, my neighbors aren't just the folks who live next door, but the people I share my college campus with. The dormitory I stay in is my community, and the surrounding campus is my neighborhood too, albeit to a lesser degree. Now, you might think my situation's a bit unusual, but my neighborhood still shares some common traits with what you'd expect from a typical neighborhood. It's got houses, people, stores, and parks – the basics, really. Let's start with the \"houses\" in my neighborhood, although they're a bit different from what you'd find elsewhere. In my neck of the woods, we've got three types of housing: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory houses. First off, the apartments usually have 2-4 people sharing a room, with 4-6 rooms per floor, and about 20 people living in each building on average. Then there are the actual houses, which are mostly 2-4 bedroom setups rented by alumni, but there aren't many of those around. Last but not least, we've got the dorm rooms, which are the most common type of housing here, with two people sharing a room, except in some cases. With housing covered, let's move on to the people. My school's all about being diverse, and that's reflected in my neighborhood's makeup. We've got people from all walks of life and cultures living here, with the professional staff in the houses, new students in the dorms, and older students in the apartments. Talking about the people here would take too long, so let's skip to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. As my school is basically a self-contained neighborhood, we've got plenty of stores and a single park. The stores offer a mix of regular dining options and the school's own brand of clothing and grocery stores, so you can find everything you need within our neighborhood boundaries. Our park is a playground for all the diverse folks in my neighborhood, kept clean and safe thanks to everyone's efforts.",
            "I've been living in this neighborhood for about 10 years now, so I guess I can share some of my experiences. When I first moved here from Riverdale to Stockbridge, I was really down in the dumps. I cried because I missed my old place and the people there, but my parents wanted the best for my little sister and me, so we had to move to a better area with a nicer house and a better school. Looking back, it was a tough transition, but I slowly got used to it and made some new friends and acquaintances in school. I didn't really get to know my neighbors that well, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis, who lived right next door. They've been like family to me over the years, and I'm grateful for their presence in my life. I still remember the time I went to Mr. Glen's wedding - it was a blast, and I'm looking forward to having a similar celebration when I get married someday and can give my future wife the life she deserves. At the wedding, I was lucky enough to catch the little strap that Ms. Veda threw off her leg, but unfortunately, I missed the flowers. I had a great time dancing with Marsharii, Mr. Glen's daughter, but I haven't seen her since. I hope she's doing well and achieving her goals. This neighborhood can be confusing, but with the help of GPS, I've been able to explore it more. I've hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis, and we used to spend hours playing video games and just enjoying life. Sometimes I'd go to the park and connect with nature, which helps calm me down and brings me a sense of peace. I also like to visit the park and practice my balance with sticks I bought from Home Depot, and I sometimes bring my bokken wooden sword along. I enjoy doing what I love. There are also a basketball and tennis court nearby, although I haven't played in a while, it's nice to know they're there in case I want to pick it up again. My dad used to take me and my best friend to play tennis with Mr. Graves, and we always had a great time, even though they pushed us hard. I've had a lot of fun in this neighborhood, and there are plenty of stories to share, but these are the ones that really stand out to me. I'm excited to see what the future holds.",
            "Living in my neighborhood is pretty ideal for me because it's just a short walk to the college I attend. Most of the apartments around me are decently priced, and there are some affordable bars and restaurants nearby that I enjoy going to. However, one of the bars just got a new name and seems to be priced a bit higher, but the quality of service and drinks is still good. The crowd is generally nice, consisting of college students and low-income residents. The area is also quite family-friendly, with an elementary school nearby that's within walking distance. I don't really know my neighbors, but I'm a bit amused by how they often smoke weed - the management even installed an air freshener unit in front of their door, which my boyfriend and I found quite funny. It's almost like they're being mocked. The buildings in my area are mostly old but have been renovated inside. Down the street, there are some brand new apartments, but I'm not a fan because I heard the construction wasn't great and the rent is still quite high. I think it's a scam, but since they're close to campus, the management gets away with it. There's a super cheap restaurant nearby that serves food on paper plates and microwaves most of their dishes. Across from it is a gas station that's not exactly a great place to work. Thanks to some city funding, the road was repaved last summer, making it look a bit nicer with a big sidewalk and lots of grass. However, my apartment building is surrounded by a lot of trees, which I think is nice. They've cut down a few, but there are still plenty more than in the surrounding areas. Behind my building is a tree line and another apartment complex. The street behind mine is 43rd, and it's not as nice as 42nd where I live. The sidewalks are in bad shape, and most of the buildings look run-down. The street is lined with trees, but it's probably just to hide the state of the buildings. There have been some issues with crime in the area, particularly at an apartment complex on 43rd, but I don't think it's entirely their fault. There are other apartments across from me with similar problems and a transient population. Despite this, I like living here because it's affordable and convenient, with the university nearby and two bus stops for easy access to the store and downtown.",
            "I live in a neighborhood with a unique charm. It's made up of identical-looking duplexes on a cul-de-sac, each painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. The friendly vibe is palpable, with most neighbors getting along and even chatting with each other on their driveways in the evenings. It's a refreshing escape from the digital world we're often immersed in, like stepping back in time. We're surrounded by lush fields, trees, and the vast blue sky with puffy white clouds, creating a serene atmosphere. However, this season brought some unexpected challenges – tornado warnings and actual sirens that forced us to seek shelter. I was right there in my bathtub, clutching my little dog and my purse, while my bigger dog stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The neighborhood was eerily quiet, except for the sound of hail pounding the ground. As the storm passed, the temperature dropped drastically, causing the road to steam up. The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement, and as I looked up, a beautiful double rainbow appeared in the sky. I quickly grabbed my camera and snapped some amazing shots to share with my friends and family on Facebook. They were just as amazed as I was. The streets remained quiet for a while until people returned home, and then it was back to normal – kids playing outside while their parents cooked dinner. I'm so grateful to have found this lovely neighborhood, especially after moving from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I adore the Southern accent and the friendly people. My two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment might look the same as the others on the outside, but each one has its unique interior. Some are surprisingly small, and I'm still trying to figure out why. I love taking long walks through the big field behind my home and strolling down to the pond, where I often spot deer and listen to the enchanting song of the bullfrog. It's a great place to live, just 40 minutes outside Charlotte. Every morning starts with the sweet sound of roosters crowing from the nearby farms, giving me a sense of living in a small village community. Even the nearby farm has a lovable donkey that brays in the evening to remind us he's there. I feel so lucky to have found this gem of a neighborhood.",
            "My family and I moved into this neighborhood a little while before I started eighth grade. It took some time for me to adjust and make friends, but I ended up becoming close to two neighbours, one of whom lives just two doors down from me and the other on the same street. Unfortunately, they're no longer living here now, but the memories we made are still vivid. The people who've been here since I first moved in are still around, which is nice. My neighbourhood is pretty typical, with rows of two-story houses, and every weekend when the weather's warm, you can hear kids playing outside. It's usually pretty quiet here most weekdays, though. I've never had any issues with my neighbours, and I feel comfortable trusting them. I've ordered plenty of packages online and never had one go missing from my porch. There's a park about a minute's walk from my house, where I have lots of fond memories. I used to play basketball, football, and baseball with the other guys in the neighbourhood, but one of my worst memories is also from there – I got elbowed in the nose while playing football! Despite that, the good times far outweigh the bad. Nowadays, when I visit the park, it's usually to spend time with my cousin's younger kids. They love playing on the swings and slides, and it brings a smile to my face seeing them have so much fun. The park holds a special place in my heart, and every time I go there, I'm filled with nostalgia. \n\nMy neighbourhood is pretty diverse, with loads of different food options nearby. Within a one-mile radius, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, with the rise of food delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash, many people just order in instead of going out. The most popular spots are usually the fast food chains, which are common in most suburban neighbourhoods. There are plenty of pizza places too. The local stores have everything you could need, including multiple dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store – a popular chain in the Midwest. Some of the stores even cater to specific tastes, like an Indian-owned shop where you can buy ingredients for homemade Indian dishes or ready-made food. Overall, I'm really happy with my neighbourhood. When I see the horror stories on social media and the news about people's experiences with their neighbours, I feel grateful for mine.",
            "My neighborhood is a humble little town in South Carolina. It may not stand out, but it has a significant impact on the region's agriculture. Johnston proudly claims to be the Peach Capital of the World, and this pride is reflected on the town's welcoming sign. The town is mainly composed of farmland with peach trees and cattle dominating the landscape. Houses are scattered, with most being two-story homes featuring either metal or gray roofs to combat the scorching summer heat. Those situated outside the main part of town are often farther back from the road, allowing for the front fields to be used for animals and crops. The main part of town is marked by a single four-way stop light, where you'll find the town's only stores. For those craving convenience food, there's Hong Kong, a family-run Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, but it sadly closed down not too long ago. You'll also find Maxwell and Halford Drug, a small family-owned pharmacy famous for their Cherry Coca-Cola. A small, but pricey grocery store called IGA is the town's only supermarket, but many residents prefer to visit the Walmart in nearby Batesburg-Leesville for their grocery needs. The most popular store in town, however, is Dollar General, which sells a wide range of everyday essentials and is always bustling from opening to closing time. There's also Possibilities Furniture & More, a cozy furniture store run by a well-known local woman who hires movers to deliver purchased items. Next door to the furniture store is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a small pet groomers offering various services like daycare, boarding, and grooming. Both the doctor's and veterinary practice are situated outside the main part of town, but they're both well-equipped to serve the community. Johnston Elementary School is the town's only school, and students attend middle and high school in the neighboring town after completing fifth grade. Although there aren't many parks or entertainment options, the town is currently developing a 2.5-acre recreational area to provide families with more opportunities for outdoor activities and attract new residents. Despite its simplicity, Johnston is a charming town that can easily go unnoticed in the blink of an eye.",
            "The first time I heard about my area, I was tuning into a podcast about people who had vanished. It caught me off guard, as almost every apartment in the neighborhood was being sold for over $1000 a month. I had never heard anything about it, nor had any of my friends. I guess that's what happens when you're struggling. I know a few of my friends have trouble sleeping at night because things are just so expensive. But we've learned to be frugal over the years. You start to get used to the smell of flea market toys and old clothes that have been tucked away for a while. You smell less in adulthood, and you might even start smoking or just get used to things being a certain way. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty old magazines stacked on an old piano, and it gets stuck in the leather even after you wash it. Our neighborhood has three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start from the far side, you can visit two charity shops, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curio shop. Downtown is crowded, with cars and people everywhere in the morning, but you wouldn't know it in the thrift stores. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the stores are always quiet. It's a great place to waste an afternoon. Every year, there are more and more cars and people flooding the city. It's developing, they say. One of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery calls it home, and it's still showing signs of growth. It reminds me of New York. Everyone's got their own goals, and nobody really bothers you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep your shell as long as you want, and the city will just roll with it. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have more of a community of friends than a bunch of strangers living in an apartment. We come together for birthdays, funerals, and when we need each other. In some ways, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors, and they treat me pretty well. I try to keep my apartment clean and leave them food, and they do the same for me. We exchange mail and it's nice to see them. I think they enjoy my presence just as much as I do theirs. Despite living in a massive, impersonal modernist sprawl, it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't completely mess up my life.",
            "My neighborhood is a classic example of cookie cutter suburbia. I live in an area where the presence of a homeowner's association is strongly felt. As soon as you step in, you'll notice rows of perfectly maintained single-family homes, thanks to the HOA. The front yards are surprisingly uniform, with a small patch of grass, decorative pebbles, and short driveways. Every now and then, you'll spot a small tree or two. It's also common to see two-car garages on most homes. The roads are immaculate, with newly paved concrete and no potholes in sight. While the majority of houses are single-story, a few have two stories. One thing that stands out is the unique mailbox system. Instead of having individual mailboxes in front of each house, we have a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street, which requires a key to access your specific box. There are also two larger lockers for packages, all thanks to the HOA's emphasis on uniformity. Our neighborhood is situated on the outskirts of the nearby city, making it a mix of rural and suburban living. As a result, we have plenty of space for various amenities. There are multiple community pools, all well-maintained and gated, where anyone living here can swim. We also have walking trails where you can take your dog for a walk or enjoy an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get some exercise; simply running around the neighborhood will suffice.\n\nThe community is predominantly made up of retirees, who make up a significant portion of the residents. It's an extremely safe area, with everyone looking out for one another. Mixed in with the retirees are a few middle-aged and young professionals. Our city is surprisingly large in terms of population but has a small-town feel. We have all the amenities you'd expect, including a single mall that may not be huge but gets the job done. It takes me around 15 minutes to drive to any major destination, but once I arrive, I'm greeted with a variety of stores to choose from. We have high-end grocery stores with organic options to bargain outlets with limited selection and minimal staff to keep costs low. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have many nice amenities like pools and walking trails, and while we're not right next door to shopping, it's just a short drive to get to any major chain store.",
            "I reside in a small Midwestern town just on the outskirts of a major city, nestled in the suburbs. My neighborhood, situated on the east side, is considered one of the economically disadvantaged areas of the town. The property values are relatively low, with many houses being rented or owned by families with lower incomes. Yet, it's not an uninviting place. My neighbors are generally friendly folks who greet me with a smile when I walk down the street. Although the crime rates are slightly higher than in other parts of town, they're still manageable. Over the past decade, there have been some violent incidents, including a few shootings and a homicide, within a few blocks of my home. I recall our next-door neighbors losing their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Thankfully, our family hasn't been directly affected by crime, except for the occasional missing item from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. Our town has been significantly impacted by the \"opioid epidemic\" that has affected many parts of the United States. However, there are various resources available to combat this issue, including rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those struggling with addiction. Despite these challenges, our town has many appealing qualities. My son's elementary school boasts an excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. He has not faced any bullying, thanks to the positive atmosphere of the school, and he genuinely enjoys attending. We have an active PTO that organizes numerous events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Given that over 20% of our town's population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. No child or family is treated as inferior due to financial constraints, and the costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are relatively low. The City Council and staff have made efforts to improve our town's appearance, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side, where I reside, tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for my neighbors and me. Overall, I appreciate living in this town. People are generally kind, the schools are excellent, there are sufficient shopping options to meet our needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it's comfortable and suitable. We've lived here for over 16 years, and it's hard to imagine calling anywhere else home.",
            "My neighborhood is a melting pot of culture, perched on a hill amidst a cluster of buildings steeped in history. I reside in a 7-story apartment building, directly opposite the old theater, and just a block away is this charming arcade bar that attracts a diverse crowd on warm summer evenings. On weekends in June and July, a long queue often forms outside its doors. Just a few blocks up is the city's nearest park, a sprawling green space considering its location in this part of town. The park is surrounded by concrete, with tall stairs carved into the wall. During the harsh winter months, homeless people set up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and the wide steps. This strategic placement keeps them relatively warmer, despite the lack of snow, and allows them easy access to the nearby family center, where they can bathe and shower. What I cherish about my city, though, isn't its historic architecture or the grand buildings that dot the hillsides. It's the community that truly makes it special. You see, Hilltop was once notorious for gang violence on the West Coast. Even decades later, stories of the federal government and DEA swooping in to clean up the streets still circulate. The people haven't forgotten. These stories are passed down through generations, from the original residents to newcomers like me, as a reminder of the neighborhood's rough past. Despite its reputation, the community works hard to maintain its cleanliness and care about what goes on in their city and on their block. They even caution outsiders not to venture out after dark, a warning that still carries the weight of its troubled history. As a 'not-quite-white' girl, I feel a connection to this community. Perhaps it's because I'm dark enough to blend in, or maybe Hilltop has accepted me as one of their own, someone who's aware of the ingrained racism and biases that plague our society. I know one thing: Hilltop will always be my home. I feel alive strolling through the streets at night, surrounded by people who've shown me kindness and empathy more often than not. It's a place where laundromats stay open late to let me charge my phone when I'm caught in the rain, and where strangers have handed me money and told me I'm beautiful and valuable, even when I felt invisible.",
            "I live in the heart of Rural America, nestled in the quaint town of Michigan. My home is surrounded by the picturesque beauty of farmland and charming tourist cities. Life here is simple, with no big city malls, chain stores like Wal-mart or Target, or restaurants like Applebee's within reach. You have to drive to get anywhere, but the journey is worth it, as I'm blessed to live in one of the most breathtaking places on earth, surrounded by two magnificent lakes - Lake Michigan to the one side and Lake Charlevoix to the other. Every corner of our small town offers a serene beach to dip your toes in, making it a haven for those seeking tranquility. My neighborhood is a classic example of small-town living, with houses that reflect the essence of Middle America. These aren't cookie-cutter homes, but rather unique, older residences that have been lovingly updated and remodeled over the years. Many of these homes boast basements, some of which are fully-fledged and open to the eye from the street. The neighborhood is a kaleidoscope of colors, with houses painted in every hue imaginable. Most homes have spacious yards, complete with trampolines, playsets, gardens, and fences for pets. Our community is comprised of hardworking individuals who strive to make a living and raise their families. On any given day, you'll see kids playing in the streets, people strolling their dogs, biking, or rollerblading. Neighbors know one another, and it's not uncommon to see a friendly wave or a smile from a passerby. The lawns are meticulously maintained, with green grass and well-trimmed plants adding to the neighborhood's charm. While it may not be the most stunning neighborhood you've ever seen, it's one that exudes a sense of belonging and a promise of a safe haven. Within walking distance, you'll find the county sheriff's department, the health department, and the recycling center, all of which serve our community. Our small town is also home to baseball and softball fields, where you can hear the excitement of the game, and a nearby airport where small planes take off and land. You can stroll to the local ice cream parlor, and if you're feeling adventurous, take a short walk downtown. The best part? My kids can ride their bikes to the nearby park, just 8 blocks away. It's a wonderful place to call home."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "Yesterday, I pondered the diversity of my neighborhood in this large city.  Residential areas are scattered randomly between commercial ones, where you can find a variety of businesses like offices, stores, restaurants, and entertainment spots. There's no shortage of restaurants to dine at and stores to shop from. While some stores are well-known brands owned by large corporations, others are small boutiques that are increasingly popular. These boutiques line the streets and are within walking distance of quiet neighborhoods that would otherwise be serene. There are also nearby parks where people take their young children to spend quality time. As for the people, my neighborhood is surprisingly diverse. In one small area, you'll find a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a group of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. If you venture out, you'll find even more people from different racial and ethnic backgrounds, although they tend to form their own communities within the city. There are areas known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and more, just a few miles away. However, those few miles can be a lengthy drive due to traffic, especially during rush hour. It's no surprise that hardly anyone walks anywhere in my city. With some attractions within walking distance, the city is huge, and people generally prefer not to commute on foot. As a result, the city is plagued by terrible traffic, and parking spots are scarce. Ironically, there's been a lot of construction lately, with new apartment buildings popping up. It seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are worried that it'll only lead to more people and traffic. My city has a mix of different types of houses, ranging from large apartment buildings to smaller houses and condominiums. Some properties are single-family homes, while others are duplexes. Even within my immediate neighborhood, there's a variety of housing options. The neighborhood is also home to people of all ages, and I must admit that I'm not familiar with most of my neighbors. It's not the kind of close-knit community it used to be, but I do have fond memories of playing with my next-door neighbor and a few other friends from the neighborhood when I was younger.",
            "My neighborhood is an interesting place. It's a mix of single-family homes, though some have been split into two, still connected, if you can imagine that. My house has a small front yard and a driveway to its left, just like most of the others. It's a reminder of the 'American dream,' a concept that once seemed to capture the hearts of this nation, but now seems to be slipping away. Yet, my neighborhood and many others still stand as a testament to that dream, holding onto it as tightly as we can. The people here don't feel as optimistic as they used to; the upkeep of the lawns isn't what it once was, but you can still spot a car or two in every driveway, and the youth still play as if nothing's wrong. Our public school, which has been here for almost 90 years, still stands, inspiring a sense of possibility in the youth and nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, but the basketball courts are always bustling. Every house looks different, yet feels the same. We have a large supermarket called 'Super A,' which has been run by a Yemni family, who are possibly the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The majority of residents are African American. The streets are wide, and the kids play football, pausing only to let cars pass. Many of us have lived here for generations, and we all have stories to share about a time when everyone knew everyone. We had a karate school, but when the fad died down, it became a pharmacy, because, as they say, \"a pill can fix everything.\" We also have a small movie theater that shows old films at a discounted price, a place the youth avoids due to its outdated titles, but the elders cherish it as a way to spend a night out without the kids. There's a single expressway that runs through our town, though the entrance and exit are in the town next door. There was a petition to get an exit for our town, but the youth supported it, while the elders opposed it, fearing it would ruin our town. We're building a new high school, and we're struggling to decide on a mascot for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the perfect representation of our town.",
            "At first glance, it may seem like just any other residential area - tucked away behind a shopping strip, it's not a place you'd expect to find a thriving community. But look closer, and you'll discover an entire world hidden behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and the hotels that are only occasionally occupied except for family reunions during the summer. Behind these buildings lies a bustling neighborhood, complete with a series of apartment complexes side by side like Russian nesting dolls carefully arranged on the street. One complex has seen its fair share of controversy, but we'll set that aside for now. The others nearby, however, paint a vastly different picture.\n\nNearby, a community college's satellite campus stands quietly by the road, its sleepy buildings a stark contrast to the hustle and bustle of the surrounding area. Students shuffle in for their morning classes, yawning and sipping their coffee as the iron gates creak open to let them in. Commuters driving by curse at the traffic congestion caused by the students. Down the road, a park and a rehabilitation center provide a stark contrast to the busy campus. The rehab center boasts a cheerful porch and a lazily turning ceiling fan, while children play tag in the park across the street, their laughter and shouts mingling with the buzzing bees in the nearby flower patches. Retirees stroll their dogs along the walking path, scowling at the teens on skateboards and nodding politely at the girls gossiping by the playground.\n\nIn a nearby strip mall, you can find a sushi restaurant with affordable food but rarely any crowd, a swimming supply store, and a nail salon nestled in between. It's possible to fill up your pool and get a manicure while enjoying hibachi chicken, all in one stop - the epitome of convenience. There's also a DIY frozen yogurt shop where teens often gather to do tricks on their skateboards and vape, sipping cold, dripping cups of frozen yogurt topped with their favorite treats. This little neighborhood is a slice of quintessential America, frozen in time and changeless, much like the sleepy south that surrounds it.",
            "As we cruised past the endless cornfields which stretched as far as my eyes could see, she asked, \"Where is everything?\" I knew she'd be taken aback by the bare expanses of open land. Coming from a town where the nearest grocery store was just a 5-minute walk away, she'd never experienced this much space before. I filled her in on what it was like growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood me and where I'm from. We drove along a two-lane country road, passing by a quarry filled with water before reaching my small development. The houses here are mostly brick and stucco, each with a lush half-acre of land that the residents take great pride in maintaining. Come spring, the annual flowers bloom alongside the midwestern trees that change with the seasons. The driveways are lined with sleek Mercedes-Benz luxury cars, glistening in the sunlight after a good wash. My home, a grey stucco house, came into view, and I pointed out my friendly Korean neighbor, who's always tending to his lawn and singing along to the hum of his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Everyone in the neighborhood loves him for his genuine and unique personality. He's aged and lost some of his wit, but his past as a doctor is still evident. As we continued down the road, I showed her the side yard, where geese roam free and are chased by our feisty Terrier. The backyard has a small stream that feeds into the quarry, where you can hear the soothing sounds of bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional \"moo\" from the nearby farms. Across a handmade wooden bridge lies an untouched oasis, teeming with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This is where I spent most of my childhood, building tree forts, playing \"hunt\" (which mostly involved chasing animals), and having neighborhood friends to share in the fun. Winters in my hometown can be harsh, but there's something beautiful about it. The yard transforms from a lush green to a barren wilderness, and the trees that once bloomed with vibrant flowers turn into skeletal branches. When snow falls, a winter wonderland appears overnight, and the backyard is filled with snow angels and snowmen made by my little sister and me. We fought frequently as kids, but during the winter, snowballs were our go-to weapon. We'd build massive forts to house our arsenal, using branches and our imaginations to create our own little wonderland – a place where we were carefree, just kids without a worry in the world.",
            "To truly grasp the essence of Portland, Oregon, one must first understand what being \"weird\" truly means. The unofficial town motto, proudly plastered on a building that defies categorization as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, and strip club, all while skirting the law, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, this phrase is a nostalgic reminder of the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's - a lesser-known, more affordable city that fostered unique and creative subcultures. For others, it's an invitation to come to Portland, where the term \"weird\" is now a badge of honor. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the relentless construction of high-rise condos to accommodate them, Portland remains stubbornly eccentric. Being weird doesn't mean being judgmental or exclusive, but rather accepting of things that wouldn't normally be accepted. We have our modern amenities and our share of modern issues, just like the rest of the country - we import most of our goods from China. There are countless ways to be weird, to be unconventional, but Portland has its fair share of the ordinary. You'll find yoga enthusiasts, hipsters, and suit-and-tie professionals living alongside one another. Perhaps \"weird\" simply means we don't take ourselves too seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, you'll find vibrant houses, home gardens bursting with flowers, herbs, and vegetables, and free boxes lining the streets during the summer months. Free boxes are essentially discarded items - often cardboard, sometimes plastic - containing treasures perfect for the passerby. They can hold anything from clothes and books to who-knows-what, and the thrill of the hunt is all part of the magic. This is what Portland is all about to me, but I'm just one of the many weird and wonderful souls that call this city home. Some people I live among would never dream of scavenging through a box on the sidewalk, opting instead for goat yoga or Timbers matches. Portland is a city of people with diverse passions and pursuits - we're a city of dreamers, both those who are actively chasing their dreams and those who spend too much time at the bar, lost in thought. Of course, like every city, Portland struggles with its fair share of problems, including a drug epidemic that often stems from underlying mental health issues. The constant rain and grey skies don't help, but neither do we. We also grapple with homelessness, a complex issue that seems to plague every major city in the country. Our social services are better than many other places, but they're still woefully insufficient. The non-homeless population is torn between empathy and frustration, and in this, we're not at all weird - just like any other city facing similar challenges.",
            "The mountains have been consistent witnesses to the passage of time, silently standing tall in the north as the sun rises and sets each day. They remain steadfast, unperturbed by life's turmoil, and unwavering in their presence. Even when I'm consumed by work and life's demands, they're there, always a constant in my life. On days when I'm feeling overwhelmed and drained, they beckon me to take a step back and rest my anxious soul, offering me the strength to carry on, day by day. It was during my undergrad days that I first fell in love with the mountains north of campus. While the university itself boasts its own unique charm, with its beautiful buildings, ponds, and trees, it's the mountains that hold a special place in my heart. Beyond the campus, the town itself has its own beauty. There are numerous cozy cafes where I spent countless hours fuelled by caffeine and cramming, and just a short walk away lies the downtown area, where the faded brick buildings exude an air of antiquity. This blend of old and new, bustling and serene, creates a captivating atmosphere that invites exploration. As a result, I've created many cherished memories in this town, each tied to a specific location. Whether it's strolling past the rusty swings in the park with friends after a long night of studying or racing through the downtown area to catch a movie in the university's cinema, this town has been a witness to many moments of joy and laughter. However, it's also a place of painful memories, as is true with any place in life. The ponds, in particular, have become a refuge for both reflection and late-night tears during moments of existential crisis. As I watch the turtles, ducks, and insects living their lives, each contributing to the ecosystem, I'm reminded of my own search for purpose. And so, I'd walk past the pond, the park, and the small houses that epitomize suburban life, until I reached the main street. It was then that I'd gaze up at the sunrise, and as the palm trees stood tall beneath it, I'd feel the warmth of the sun's rays. That's when I'd look north and see them: the sturdy, majestic mountains, their peaks grazing the hazy blue and yellow sky. In that moment, they'd stir something deep within me, a sense of resilience that has guided me through life's challenges.",
            "Bensonhurst is quite easy to find if you're planning on visiting. The public transportation system is very accessible, making it one of the most popular modes of transportation in New York City. As you walk through the neighborhood, you'll get a true taste of the city vibe. You'll see a plethora of Asian stores all around, which are a result of the influx of Asian inhabitants over the past two decades. It's not uncommon to spot an Asian-owned store on almost every block. Supermarkets and laundromats are particularly popular, not just among locals but also among visitors, thanks to their affordable prices, high-quality food, and convenient locations. In fact, I'm lucky enough to have four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk of each other, making grocery shopping a breeze. While Bensonhurst is predominantly Asian, it's not homogeneous – you'll find a mix of immigrants, first-generation and second-generation American kids, and a diverse community. The majority of big businesses in the area are Asian-owned, but you'll also find a beautifully renovated park nearby, complete with ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, a playground, and a water fountain for kids to enjoy during the summer. The park is a melting pot of diversity, where people from different backgrounds can come together and get along. When it comes to living spaces, you won't find many high-rise corporate buildings. Instead, you'll see co-op living buildings and condominium apartments, with two-family houses being the most common type of residence. While the people here are generally nice, they can be quite loud. You'll often hear cars blasting music as they drive by, or people flooring it on the gas, which can make for an early morning wake-up call. If you're planning a night visit, be cautious; while the neighborhood is generally safe, you never know who you might run into. Be prepared to encounter people who might start trouble for no reason, bullies, and even thieves. I've had my own share of run-ins with bullies in the past, but thankfully, it was a long time ago. More recently, there have been cases of package theft in the area. Lastly, be aware that people in this neighborhood don't always follow the rules, like cleaning up after their dogs. You'll often see dog waste on the sidewalk, which can be quite frustrating. Just be careful where you step and make sure to keep your shoes clean!",
            "Where I live, the sidewalks are scarce. It's like everything flows downhill, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest slope in the neighbourhood. They call it the \"workout hill\" because many joggers like to run up it as part of their daily routine. Since there are no sidewalks on my street, people walk on the road. The road itself is pitted in some places and can be a bit hazardous to drive on due to several potholes. The telephone and electric wires strung around the block look tattered, and with the frequent rain and storms, branches and debris often knock them down, requiring constant repairs. As a result, they appear patchwork-y and worn out. The area is filled with tall evergreen trees, but the residents dislike them, viewing them as obstructing the ocean view. To compensate, many houses are built high up on the hill, with large glass-fronted second-storey sections that offer a stunning view of the bay. When the sun sets, the water seems to be lit up from below, and the sky turns a vibrant orange. However, it's cloudy most days, so the sunlight often gets filtered through the haze. The weather is mostly overcast and damp, with moss growing on everything it can, from roofs to cars to railings. I once left my car in the driveway for a month, and when I returned, it had turned green and furry with moss, taking three hours to clean off. My neighbourhood is mostly home to older residents, many of whom are retired. In contrast to children, dogs are a common sight in our area, often seen lounging in people's yards or racing down the street. If you leave a door or window open, they might sneak into your house. I once found one in my living room and had to shoo it out the front door. Rabbits are also rampant in the area, digging up roots and burrowing into lawns, much to the dismay of the gardeners. My cats, however, love them and have managed to hunt most of them out of our neighbourhood. The area is also home to a variety of birds, including small sparrows and hummingbirds, as well as the occasional hawk or eagle that soars by until chased off by the neighbourhood crows. If you're willing to hike downhill to the waterfront, you can find a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. The shoreline itself is narrow, but the rocks along the shore make for fun places to throw stones into the water. The bay is not wide, and on most days, you can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist.",
            "We live in a small neighborhood in a southern Tennessee town, situated on a street that connects two state highways. The traffic can get pretty busy, but overall, it's a quiet and peaceful area. I've gotten used to the familiar faces of my neighbors, who keep busy with yard work and daily chores. In the winter, my family and I sled down the hill on our side street, enjoying the thrill of the ride. Our house is at the front corner of the street, so we see everyone passing by and have a good idea of who lives around here. Whenever a new car appears, we take notice. Some neighbors walk their dogs or exercise, while the kids ride their bikes. We spend a lot of time at home, working from there, and our family of four - my wife, our two daughters (11 and 14 years old) - is pretty used to seeing us come and go. We love spending time outside, even on rainy days, and occasionally we fire up the grill on our back deck, filling the air with the delicious smell of barbecue. The sound of lawn mowers fills the air from March to October, reminding us that the grass is growing. Our neighborhood was once wooded, so we have plenty of shade and beautiful trees, but also a lot of leaves in the fall, which means regular raking and burning. We enjoy the smell of burning leaves, signaling the arrival of fall. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we mainly use the back door, unless someone knocks on the front door, which is a rare occurrence. When I work on my truck or other projects in the garage, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. On holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas, the neighborhood is quiet, except for the occasional visitors and extra cars parked around. It's a great place to live, and if it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "Yesterday, I reflected on my neighborhood in the high desert. It's like being smack in the middle of a vast expanse of dirt, with not a speck of green in sight. People who haven't experienced living here might not grasp the feeling of seeing nothing but brown every time they step out. When I first arrived in the 90s, the houses were scattered far apart. Now, it's the same, with new additions sprouting up everywhere. Our neighborhood is transforming into a city, but it's happening everywhere, not just here. Most people are friendly, but like any urban area, there are good and bad parts. I'm surrounded by friendly seniors, so I feel pretty lucky to live here. The local stores are mostly chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want to find something unique, you have to head elsewhere. Construction is the most prominent industry in our area, and I think it's because this city is still relatively undeveloped, leaving plenty of open space to build. To be honest, it worries me - I prefer things the way they are now. I left the city to escape the chaos and don't want to go back. Speaking of construction, my job as a drywall and T-bar installer is right in this field. What I love about my home is the wildlife. People come to the high desert for its breathtaking beauty, but it also has a unique ecosystem that needs protection. We have a responsibility to learn about the animals that call this place home so we can coexist peacefully. I've got three kids, and they're just like me - they're fascinated by lizards and desert bugs. Right now, they're outside trying to catch different species. As for attractions, we've got a few things to offer. Victorville is a great place for families to experience the desert. If you plan your visit during the San Bernardino County Fair, you'll get a memorable experience. Head to Wrightwood to see the snow-capped mountains and take some winter sports lessons to cap off your trip. If you're interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert, the Victor Valley Museum has an impressive collection of geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of how our community developed and thrived.",
            "To describe my neighborhood, I'd say my answer is pretty one-of-a-kind. While others might think of their neighborhood as a typical residential area, mine's a bit different. For me, my neighborhood is actually the college campus I stay on, and the people in my dorm are like my community. I also consider the surrounding campus as part of my neighborhood, but to a lesser extent. Despite being a bit unconventional, my neighborhood shares some familiar traits with the usual idea of a neighborhood. Like any ordinary neighborhood, it's got houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's start with the 'houses' that make up my neighborhood. Before diving into the specifics, I should clarify the different types of housing in my vicinity. There are three main types: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory houses. First, in the apartments, each room usually has 2-4 people, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor, making each building home to around 20 people. Then, there are the actual houses that are available for rent for those affiliated with the school - usually 2-4 bedroom setups, often occupied by alumni, but there aren't many of these around. Lastly, there are the dorm rooms, which house hundreds of students, typically with two people sharing a room, except in some cases. These are the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered, let's move on to the people. My school's all about diversity, and that's reflected in the mix of cultures and ages living in my neighborhood. The professional staff live in the houses, while newer students stay in dorms and older students stay in apartments. It's hard to do justice to the people in my neighborhood, so let's skip to the stores and parks. Since my school is essentially its own self-contained neighborhood, it has plenty of stores and a single park. The stores offer a mix of dining options and the school's own brand of clothing and grocery stores, so you can find everything you need within the neighborhood. The park's a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, kept clean and safe thanks to everyone's efforts.",
            "I must say that after being here for about a decade, I've got some stories to share. I still remember the day I moved here to this neighborhood, I was really down, coming from Riverdale to Stockbridge. It was tough, I won't deny it, I missed them and the life we had there, but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sis, so we packed up and moved to a new place with better housing and a better high school. It was a big change, but over the years, I got used to it and made some new friends and, unfortunately, some new enemies at school too. One thing that's stuck with me is that I never really took the time to get to know my neighbors, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis, who we were lucky to have living next door. They've been like family to me, and I'm really grateful to have them. I remember when my family and I went to Mr. Glen's wedding; it was an amazing experience, and I'm hoping to have something similar one day when I'm older and settled. When Ms. Veda took off her wedding anklet and threw it, I was quick enough to catch it, but I wish I'd caught the flowers too! We danced the night away, and I had a blast with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I've lost touch with her since, but I hope she's doing great. The neighborhood can be confusing, but now that I have a GPS, it's easier to explore. I've only gone so far, mostly hanging out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We used to spend hours playing video games and living life to the fullest. I'd also head to the park to enjoy nature, which really calms me down and gives me a sense of peace. I'd bring sticks and practice my balance, and sometimes I'd bring my bokken sword if I could. It's great to do what I love. We also have a basketball and tennis court, even though I haven't played either sport in a while, it's good to have them around just in case I decide to pick them up again. My dad got me and my best friend into tennis with Mr. Graves, and we always had a blast, even though they pushed us hard. I'm sure there are plenty of more stories from my time here, but these are the things that really stand out, and who knows, the best is yet to come.",
            "The college that I attend is actually just nearby my place, which I must say I'm pretty fortunate about. I live in an apartment building, but there are a few restaurants and bars around that are pretty cool to hang out at, and they're not too pricey. I recently heard that one of the bars has been renamed, and it's a bit more expensive than the others, but the service and drinks aren't too bad. The people in the area are pretty nice, and since it's a college town, there are mostly students and low-income individuals living in the apartment buildings. You can also tell that there are a lot of families around, probably because there's an elementary school within walking distance from my apartment. I don't really know my neighbors, and to be honest, I don't particularly want to. They smoke a lot of weed, and our apartment management decided to put an air freshener unit right outside their door, which my boyfriend and I found pretty amusing. It's almost as if they're mocking us. The apartment buildings around me are mostly old-looking on the outside, but they might have been renovated inside. A bit further down the street, there are brand new apartments, but I don't really like them. I think the construction quality isn't that great, and the rent is super high, which I think is a bit unfair. Since they're close to the campus, the management of those buildings can get away with charging us exorbitant rent. There's this really cheap restaurant just a few minutes from my place that serves food on paper plates and most of it is microwaved. Across from that place is a gas station, which I've heard isn't a great place to work. However, thanks to some funding from the city, the road was renovated last summer, so now there's a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and the area looks a bit better. But my apartment building is actually pretty shaded, with lots of trees around it. They cut down a few of them, so there are a few stumps left behind, but there are still a lot of trees around my place compared to the other street. Behind my apartment complex is a row of trees, and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind it is 43rd street, and that one's not as nice. The sidewalks on that street are pretty bad and are falling apart, and most of the buildings look pretty run-down. There are a lot of trees on that street, but it's probably just to hide the state of the buildings. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but I don't think it's fair to blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But overall, I like living here. The rent is affordable, and there are plenty of useful amenities nearby, including the university, which is within walking distance, and there are two bus stops so I can easily get to the store and downtown.",
            "My current neighborhood is comprised of rows of duplex's in a cul-de-sac. They appear to be individual houses due to the intermittent placement and spacing, although they are painted the same, with yellow walls, white porches, and green metal roofs. Most of the residents are on friendly terms with one another, which adds to the communal atmosphere. Every evening, some of us stand at the end of our driveways and engage in casual conversations while the kids in the neighborhood play with their toys, create art with sidewalk chalk, or fly their kites. This setting is a refreshing escape from the monotony of the modern world, which is dominated by technology and computers. It's as if we're living in a bygone era. The surroundings are picturesque, with fields and trees accompanied by blue skies and puffy white clouds. However, this season has brought us tornado warnings, and for the first time, we actually heard the tornado sirens last night, prompting us to seek shelter. I, along with my little dog, found myself in the bathtub, clutching my purse and a few pillows. My larger dog, however, remained in the living room, whining and barking nervously due to the unusual circumstances. The neighborhood was eerily quiet, except for the sound of large hail pounding against the ground. After the storm passed, the road was steaming due to the dramatic temperature change, with the hail melting as soon as it hit the hot pavement. As I gazed up at the clearing skies, the sun broke through, and it began to rain. A double rainbow appeared, and I quickly ran inside to grab my camera to capture the moment. I shared the photos with my friends and family on Facebook, and they were just as amazed as I was. The streets remained quiet for another hour before people started returning home, and then it was back to normal – moms and kids outside, dinner being cooked. I've grown to adore this friendly neighborhood, especially the southern accent that's become music to my ears. Although all the houses appear identical on the outside, each apartment has its own unique layout and charm. Some are surprisingly small, which I find hard to understand. I enjoy taking leisurely walks through the largest field behind my home and strolling down to the pond, which isn't suitable for swimming. I've spotted deer, and in the mornings, you can hear the deep, resonant song of the bullfrog. It's a fantastic place to live, just a forty-minute drive away from the city of Charlotte. Each morning is a beautiful start, accompanied by the sounds of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It's as if we're living in a small, self-contained community. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that lets out a distinctive bray in the evenings, serving as a gentle reminder of his presence. I feel fortunate to have found this hidden gem of a neighborhood.",
            "It was my first day of eighth grade when I moved into this neighborhood. Making friends wasn't easy at first, but luckily I connected with two of my neighbors - one living two houses down and another on my street. Unfortunately, they've since moved away, but the memories still linger. To my surprise, most of the original residents who welcomed me when I first arrived are still here. Our neighborhood is pretty much your typical American suburban setup - rows of two-story houses and the usual sounds of kids playing outside on warm days. Weekends are usually pretty quiet, but when it's warm, you can hear the laughter of kids outside. I've been fortunate to have never had any issues with my neighbors, and it's clear that this is a community where you're left alone unless you genuinely need help. Online deliveries have become a norm, and I've ordered multiple times without ever having a package go missing from my porch. This speaks volumes about the trust my neighbors have in each other. A park just a minute or two away has been a hub for some of my fondest memories, including playing basketball, football, and baseball with my neighborhood friends. However, it's also where I suffered a painful injury when I got elbowed in the nose during a football game. The good memories far outweigh the bad, though. Nowadays, I visit the park to spend quality time with my cousin's younger kids, who still love playing on the swings and slides. Watching them brings back a mix of emotions, making me nostalgic for my past experiences there. The neighborhood is a melting pot of cultures, with an array of cuisines nearby. Just within a one-mile radius, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants, as well as plenty of fast-food shops and pizza places. Online food delivery services like GrubHub and DoorDash have become increasingly popular, though. The local stores cater to all our needs, with multiple dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store on the same street. There's even an Indian-owned store for those who crave homemade or ready-made Indian food. After seeing the unfortunate stories of neighborly conflicts on social media and news, I feel grateful to live in a neighborhood where I can trust my neighbors.",
            "My hometown is a charming little town in South Carolina that doesn't stand out from the rest, but it's a significant contributor to the agriculture sector. Johnston claims to be the Peach Capital of the World, a title proudly displayed on the town's welcoming sign. Its main landscape consists of farmland where peach trees and cattle dominate the scene. Houses, mostly two-story affairs with metal or gray roofs to combat the scorching summer heat, are scattered throughout the outskirts of town. They're often set back from the road, allowing the front fields to be used for grazing animals and crops. The central part of town features a single stoplight at an intersection, where the few shops are located. A small Chinese restaurant called Hong Kong, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a local burger chain, offer limited dining options. A former pizzeria has since closed down. There's a small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug, famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola. A tiny grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, is the town's sole grocery store, but many residents prefer to shop at the nearby Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville. However, the most bustling spot in town is Dollar General, which sells a vast array of everyday items and is always crowded from opening to closing. A small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind-hearted woman, has been a staple in Johnston for years and even employs delivery services. Adjacent to the furniture store is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet groomer offering various services. Both a doctor's office and a veterinary clinic are located outside the main town area, providing essential services to the residents. The town has a single elementary school, Johnston Elementary School, but students attend middle and high school in the next town over after completing the fifth grade. Although there aren't many recreational activities, the town is working on creating a 2.5-acre recreational area to attract visitors and potential residents. While it's a quiet town with limited amenities, it's still a pleasant place to live, so small that you could easily miss it in the blink of an eye.",
            "The first time I heard about my neighborhood, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It caught me off guard. Almost every apartment in the area was renting for over a thousand dollars a month, but I'd never heard anything about this story. Neither had my friends. It's like the darkness that settles in when you're struggling. I know some of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night due to financial struggles. We've learned to be thrifty over the years, but it's funny how you start to appreciate the smell of second-hand items and old clothes. You even start to enjoy the smell of stale air. As an adult, you might start smoking or just get used to the way things are. But the thrift stores in my area never fail to remind me of this reality. There are three within walking distance, and if you start from the far end, you'll find charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. The townscape may be chaotic, with cars and people packed into the streets every morning, but the thrift stores are always quiet. It's the perfect place to lose an afternoon. Every year, the city grows more crowded with cars and people. It's a developing city, they say, and it's home to one of the largest e-commerce empires. It reminds me of New York, where everyone's focused on their goals and nobody bothers you. You can keep to yourself, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where people seem to pry into your life. In this city, you can keep your shell intact, and the city will just roll on like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be, with the pianist next door and the amateur vocalists upstairs always creating something new. We don't live in a typical apartment of strangers; instead, we're a community of friends who come together for birthdays, funerals, and when we need help. I'm lucky to be here, and I really like most of my neighbors. We look out for each other, clean up after ourselves, and share food and mail. It's nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. Despite living in a massive modernist sprawl, my neighbors make me feel like I haven't completely messed up my life.",
            "I live in a typical suburban area, nothing out of the ordinary. My neighborhood is like a cookie cutter version of suburban living. Everywhere you look, you'll see well-maintained single family homes, thanks to our homeowner's association. The front yards all share a similar theme: a small patch of neatly cut grass, some decorative pebbles, and short driveways. You'll also spot small trees scattered here and there. Every house has two-car garages. As you drive through the neighborhood, you'll notice newly paved concrete roads in excellent condition – no potholes or bumps in sight. Most of the homes are one-story, but some have two stories as well. What sets our neighborhood apart is the mail system. Instead of individual mailboxes in front of each house, we have a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street that require a key to access. We also have two big package lockers, courtesy of our HOA's love for uniformity. Our neighborhood is on the outskirts of the nearby city, so it's a mix of rural and suburban living. We have plenty of open land and a range of amenities, including multiple community pools that are well-maintained and gated. There are also walking trails where you can take your dog for a walk or go for a solo evening stroll. Exercise isn't a problem here – you can simply run around the neighborhood and get your daily dose of exercise. Our community is predominantly made up of retirees, but we also have a mix of middle-aged and young professionals. The city itself is surprisingly large, with a small-town feel. We have all the amenities you'd expect, including a single mall that may not be huge, but gets the job done. It takes me about 15 minutes to drive to anywhere significant, but once I get there, I have access to a variety of stores, from high-end grocery stores to bargain outlets. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty standard – we have our nice touches like pools and walking trails, and while we're not right next door to any shopping centers, it's an easy drive to get to any major chain store I want.",
            "I reside in a small Midwestern town situated just outside the suburban outskirts of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, located on the east side, is considered the most economically disadvantaged area within the town. Property values are on the lower side, with most houses rented or owned by low-income individuals, yet it's far from unattractive or unpleasant. The people in my neighborhood are generally friendly and always greet me with a smile when I walk down the street. Crime rates are slightly higher than in other parts of town, but still relatively low. In the past decade, a few violent crimes have occurred close to my home, including shootings and a homicide. Our next-door neighbors recently lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar. Fortunately, my family hasn't been directly affected by crime, except for occasionally losing items from our porch when we forget to bring them inside. Our town has been greatly impacted by the \"opioid epidemic\" affecting many parts of the United States. Unfortunately, many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are numerous resources available to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those struggling with addiction. Despite the challenges, my town has many positive qualities. My son's elementary school has an excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. He has special needs, yet he hasn't faced any bullying due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he truly loves attending. We have an active PTO that organizes multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Given that over 20% of our town's population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child ever goes hungry. No child or family is treated as less than due to financial constraints, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are reasonable. The City Council and staff have implemented various improvements to our town's appearance, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the town center and on the west side, where shopping areas are located and most traffic passes through. In contrast, the east side, where I live, tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for my neighbors and me. Despite these issues, I genuinely enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are excellent, there are sufficient shopping options to meet my family's needs, and while our home may not be worth much, it is comfortable and suitable. We've lived here for over 16 years, and it's hard to imagine calling anywhere else home.",
            "My neighborhood is a vibrant cultural hub, nestled on a hill surrounded by buildings steeped in history. I live in a 7-story apartment building right opposite the old theater, and just down the road, you'll find a trendy arcade bar that draws in a diverse crowd on warm summer evenings. The line of people waiting to get in is a common sight, especially during weekends in June and July. A short walk up is the city park, a decent size considering its location. The park is encircled by concrete, with steep stairs carved into the wall. During the harsh winter months, you'll see homeless people setting up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and wide steps. Although it doesn't snow often, the heavy rainfall in mid-winter can be challenging to cope with. By setting their tents close together in the city center, they stay relatively warmer. They're also close to the local family center, where they can access basic necessities like showers and baths. What I love about my city isn't its historic architecture or the hills that roll down to the ocean. It's the people themselves who make my neighborhood so special. You see, Hilltop was once notorious for gang violence on the West Coast, and stories of federal officials and the DEA sweeping through the area still circulate today. The community still remembers those days. Despite being considered one of the rougher neighborhoods in the city, the people work hard to keep it clean and safe. They still care about what happens in their area, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill at night, but I think this warning is a relic of the past, tainted with social conditioning. Perhaps it's because I blend in as a 'not-so-white' person, or maybe the Hilltop community recognizes me as one of their own, someone who's just as aware of the reminders that plague our nation. These reminders are a result of racism, cultural conditioning, and ignorance-fueled assumptions, even in a city that prides itself as a cultural melting pot. I know one thing: no matter where life takes me, Hilltop will always be home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who've shown me kindness and compassion, even when I needed it most. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open late to charge my phone when I was stranded in the rain. It's a place where I've sat, feeling invisible, huddled against a concrete storefront on a bleak night, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I reside in Rural America, a small town in Michigan. The landscape here is a beautiful mix of farmland and quaint tourist cities. We don't have the big city luxuries like malls, chain stores like Wal-mart or Target, or even a fancy restaurant like Applebee's. Everything you need is within driving distance. Despite this, our little town is surrounded by breathtaking natural beauty - the stunning waters of Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Every corner of our \"city\" offers access to a beach where you can dip your toes in the water. Our neighborhood perfectly embodies the essence of small-town life. Houses are spread out, not towering on top of each other like in big cities. They're a mix of old and new, with some homes dating back years and others beautifully renovated. Most houses have full basements that are visible from the road, giving them a charming, down-to-earth feel. The neighborhood is a kaleidoscope of colors, with houses painted in every hue imaginable. Yards are a common feature, with trampolines, playsets, and even gardens and fences for pets. The atmosphere is quintessentially Middle American - hardworking folks striving to make a living, some raising families and others having already done so. On any given day, you'll see kids running up and down the streets, people walking their dogs, biking, or rollerblading. Neighbors know and look out for one another, and you can quickly tell who's part of the community and who's an outsider. You'll see people grilling in their front yards, waving at passersby, or walking their dogs and exchanging pleasantries with neighbors a few blocks away. Lawns are well-maintained, with neatly trimmed grass and tidy gardens. It's not a neighborhood that will leave you awestruck, but one that exudes a sense of comfort and security. It's a quiet, peaceful place where you can feel safe, and that's exactly what people want in life. Within walking distance, you'll find the county sheriff's department, the health department, and the recycling center, which serves the entire city. We have baseball and softball fields nearby, where you can hear the announcers calling out the names of players and keeping score. The small town airport is just a stone's throw away, and you can often hear the sound of small planes taking off and landing. You can also walk to the local ice cream shop or head downtown from our neighborhood. My kids can ride their bikes to the nearby park, which is just an 8-block ride away. It's a wonderful place to call home."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "Yesterday, I pondered the diversity of my neighborhood in this large city.  Residential areas are scattered randomly between commercial ones, where you can find a variety of businesses like offices, stores, restaurants, and entertainment spots. There's no shortage of restaurants to dine at and stores to shop from. While some stores are well-known brands owned by large corporations, others are small boutiques that are increasingly popular. These boutiques line the streets and are within walking distance of quiet neighborhoods that would otherwise be serene. There are also nearby parks where people take their young children to spend quality time. As for the people, my neighborhood is surprisingly diverse. In one small area, you'll find a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a group of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. If you venture out, you'll find even more people from different racial and ethnic backgrounds, although they tend to form their own communities within the city. There are areas known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and more, just a few miles away. However, those few miles can be a lengthy drive due to traffic, especially during rush hour. It's no surprise that hardly anyone walks anywhere in my city. With some attractions within walking distance, the city is huge, and people generally prefer not to commute on foot. As a result, the city is plagued by terrible traffic, and parking spots are scarce. Ironically, there's been a lot of construction lately, with new apartment buildings popping up. It seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are worried that it'll only lead to more people and traffic. My city has a mix of different types of houses, ranging from large apartment buildings to smaller houses and condominiums. Some properties are single-family homes, while others are duplexes. Even within my immediate neighborhood, there's a variety of housing options. The neighborhood is also home to people of all ages, and I must admit that I'm not familiar with most of my neighbors. It's not the kind of close-knit community it used to be, but I do have fond memories of playing with my next-door neighbor and a few other friends from the neighborhood when I was younger.",
            "My neighborhood is an interesting place. It's a mix of single-family homes, though some have been split into two, still connected, if you can imagine that. My house has a small front yard and a driveway to its left, just like most of the others. It's a reminder of the 'American dream,' a concept that once seemed to capture the hearts of this nation, but now seems to be slipping away. Yet, my neighborhood and many others still stand as a testament to that dream, holding onto it as tightly as we can. The people here don't feel as optimistic as they used to; the upkeep of the lawns isn't what it once was, but you can still spot a car or two in every driveway, and the youth still play as if nothing's wrong. Our public school, which has been here for almost 90 years, still stands, inspiring a sense of possibility in the youth and nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, but the basketball courts are always bustling. Every house looks different, yet feels the same. We have a large supermarket called 'Super A,' which has been run by a Yemni family, who are possibly the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The majority of residents are African American. The streets are wide, and the kids play football, pausing only to let cars pass. Many of us have lived here for generations, and we all have stories to share about a time when everyone knew everyone. We had a karate school, but when the fad died down, it became a pharmacy, because, as they say, \"a pill can fix everything.\" We also have a small movie theater that shows old films at a discounted price, a place the youth avoids due to its outdated titles, but the elders cherish it as a way to spend a night out without the kids. There's a single expressway that runs through our town, though the entrance and exit are in the town next door. There was a petition to get an exit for our town, but the youth supported it, while the elders opposed it, fearing it would ruin our town. We're building a new high school, and we're struggling to decide on a mascot for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the perfect representation of our town.",
            "At first glance, it may seem like just any other residential area - tucked away behind a shopping strip, it's not a place you'd expect to find a thriving community. But look closer, and you'll discover an entire world hidden behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and the hotels that are only occasionally occupied except for family reunions during the summer. Behind these buildings lies a bustling neighborhood, complete with a series of apartment complexes side by side like Russian nesting dolls carefully arranged on the street. One complex has seen its fair share of controversy, but we'll set that aside for now. The others nearby, however, paint a vastly different picture.\n\nNearby, a community college's satellite campus stands quietly by the road, its sleepy buildings a stark contrast to the hustle and bustle of the surrounding area. Students shuffle in for their morning classes, yawning and sipping their coffee as the iron gates creak open to let them in. Commuters driving by curse at the traffic congestion caused by the students. Down the road, a park and a rehabilitation center provide a stark contrast to the busy campus. The rehab center boasts a cheerful porch and a lazily turning ceiling fan, while children play tag in the park across the street, their laughter and shouts mingling with the buzzing bees in the nearby flower patches. Retirees stroll their dogs along the walking path, scowling at the teens on skateboards and nodding politely at the girls gossiping by the playground.\n\nIn a nearby strip mall, you can find a sushi restaurant with affordable food but rarely any crowd, a swimming supply store, and a nail salon nestled in between. It's possible to fill up your pool and get a manicure while enjoying hibachi chicken, all in one stop - the epitome of convenience. There's also a DIY frozen yogurt shop where teens often gather to do tricks on their skateboards and vape, sipping cold, dripping cups of frozen yogurt topped with their favorite treats. This little neighborhood is a slice of quintessential America, frozen in time and changeless, much like the sleepy south that surrounds it.",
            "As we cruised past the endless cornfields which stretched as far as my eyes could see, she asked, \"Where is everything?\" I knew she'd be taken aback by the bare expanses of open land. Coming from a town where the nearest grocery store was just a 5-minute walk away, she'd never experienced this much space before. I filled her in on what it was like growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood me and where I'm from. We drove along a two-lane country road, passing by a quarry filled with water before reaching my small development. The houses here are mostly brick and stucco, each with a lush half-acre of land that the residents take great pride in maintaining. Come spring, the annual flowers bloom alongside the midwestern trees that change with the seasons. The driveways are lined with sleek Mercedes-Benz luxury cars, glistening in the sunlight after a good wash. My home, a grey stucco house, came into view, and I pointed out my friendly Korean neighbor, who's always tending to his lawn and singing along to the hum of his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Everyone in the neighborhood loves him for his genuine and unique personality. He's aged and lost some of his wit, but his past as a doctor is still evident. As we continued down the road, I showed her the side yard, where geese roam free and are chased by our feisty Terrier. The backyard has a small stream that feeds into the quarry, where you can hear the soothing sounds of bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional \"moo\" from the nearby farms. Across a handmade wooden bridge lies an untouched oasis, teeming with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This is where I spent most of my childhood, building tree forts, playing \"hunt\" (which mostly involved chasing animals), and having neighborhood friends to share in the fun. Winters in my hometown can be harsh, but there's something beautiful about it. The yard transforms from a lush green to a barren wilderness, and the trees that once bloomed with vibrant flowers turn into skeletal branches. When snow falls, a winter wonderland appears overnight, and the backyard is filled with snow angels and snowmen made by my little sister and me. We fought frequently as kids, but during the winter, snowballs were our go-to weapon. We'd build massive forts to house our arsenal, using branches and our imaginations to create our own little wonderland – a place where we were carefree, just kids without a worry in the world.",
            "To truly grasp the essence of Portland, Oregon, one must first understand what being \"weird\" truly means. The unofficial town motto, proudly plastered on a building that defies categorization as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, and strip club, all while skirting the law, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, this phrase is a nostalgic reminder of the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's - a lesser-known, more affordable city that fostered unique and creative subcultures. For others, it's an invitation to come to Portland, where the term \"weird\" is now a badge of honor. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the relentless construction of high-rise condos to accommodate them, Portland remains stubbornly eccentric. Being weird doesn't mean being judgmental or exclusive, but rather accepting of things that wouldn't normally be accepted. We have our modern amenities and our share of modern issues, just like the rest of the country - we import most of our goods from China. There are countless ways to be weird, to be unconventional, but Portland has its fair share of the ordinary. You'll find yoga enthusiasts, hipsters, and suit-and-tie professionals living alongside one another. Perhaps \"weird\" simply means we don't take ourselves too seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, you'll find vibrant houses, home gardens bursting with flowers, herbs, and vegetables, and free boxes lining the streets during the summer months. Free boxes are essentially discarded items - often cardboard, sometimes plastic - containing treasures perfect for the passerby. They can hold anything from clothes and books to who-knows-what, and the thrill of the hunt is all part of the magic. This is what Portland is all about to me, but I'm just one of the many weird and wonderful souls that call this city home. Some people I live among would never dream of scavenging through a box on the sidewalk, opting instead for goat yoga or Timbers matches. Portland is a city of people with diverse passions and pursuits - we're a city of dreamers, both those who are actively chasing their dreams and those who spend too much time at the bar, lost in thought. Of course, like every city, Portland struggles with its fair share of problems, including a drug epidemic that often stems from underlying mental health issues. The constant rain and grey skies don't help, but neither do we. We also grapple with homelessness, a complex issue that seems to plague every major city in the country. Our social services are better than many other places, but they're still woefully insufficient. The non-homeless population is torn between empathy and frustration, and in this, we're not at all weird - just like any other city facing similar challenges.",
            "The mountains have been consistent witnesses to the passage of time, silently standing tall in the north as the sun rises and sets each day. They remain steadfast, unperturbed by life's turmoil, and unwavering in their presence. Even when I'm consumed by work and life's demands, they're there, always a constant in my life. On days when I'm feeling overwhelmed and drained, they beckon me to take a step back and rest my anxious soul, offering me the strength to carry on, day by day. It was during my undergrad days that I first fell in love with the mountains north of campus. While the university itself boasts its own unique charm, with its beautiful buildings, ponds, and trees, it's the mountains that hold a special place in my heart. Beyond the campus, the town itself has its own beauty. There are numerous cozy cafes where I spent countless hours fuelled by caffeine and cramming, and just a short walk away lies the downtown area, where the faded brick buildings exude an air of antiquity. This blend of old and new, bustling and serene, creates a captivating atmosphere that invites exploration. As a result, I've created many cherished memories in this town, each tied to a specific location. Whether it's strolling past the rusty swings in the park with friends after a long night of studying or racing through the downtown area to catch a movie in the university's cinema, this town has been a witness to many moments of joy and laughter. However, it's also a place of painful memories, as is true with any place in life. The ponds, in particular, have become a refuge for both reflection and late-night tears during moments of existential crisis. As I watch the turtles, ducks, and insects living their lives, each contributing to the ecosystem, I'm reminded of my own search for purpose. And so, I'd walk past the pond, the park, and the small houses that epitomize suburban life, until I reached the main street. It was then that I'd gaze up at the sunrise, and as the palm trees stood tall beneath it, I'd feel the warmth of the sun's rays. That's when I'd look north and see them: the sturdy, majestic mountains, their peaks grazing the hazy blue and yellow sky. In that moment, they'd stir something deep within me, a sense of resilience that has guided me through life's challenges.",
            "Bensonhurst is quite easy to find if you're planning on visiting. The public transportation system is very accessible, making it one of the most popular modes of transportation in New York City. As you walk through the neighborhood, you'll get a true taste of the city vibe. You'll see a plethora of Asian stores all around, which are a result of the influx of Asian inhabitants over the past two decades. It's not uncommon to spot an Asian-owned store on almost every block. Supermarkets and laundromats are particularly popular, not just among locals but also among visitors, thanks to their affordable prices, high-quality food, and convenient locations. In fact, I'm lucky enough to have four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk of each other, making grocery shopping a breeze. While Bensonhurst is predominantly Asian, it's not homogeneous – you'll find a mix of immigrants, first-generation and second-generation American kids, and a diverse community. The majority of big businesses in the area are Asian-owned, but you'll also find a beautifully renovated park nearby, complete with ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, a playground, and a water fountain for kids to enjoy during the summer. The park is a melting pot of diversity, where people from different backgrounds can come together and get along. When it comes to living spaces, you won't find many high-rise corporate buildings. Instead, you'll see co-op living buildings and condominium apartments, with two-family houses being the most common type of residence. While the people here are generally nice, they can be quite loud. You'll often hear cars blasting music as they drive by, or people flooring it on the gas, which can make for an early morning wake-up call. If you're planning a night visit, be cautious; while the neighborhood is generally safe, you never know who you might run into. Be prepared to encounter people who might start trouble for no reason, bullies, and even thieves. I've had my own share of run-ins with bullies in the past, but thankfully, it was a long time ago. More recently, there have been cases of package theft in the area. Lastly, be aware that people in this neighborhood don't always follow the rules, like cleaning up after their dogs. You'll often see dog waste on the sidewalk, which can be quite frustrating. Just be careful where you step and make sure to keep your shoes clean!",
            "Where I live, the sidewalks are scarce. It's like everything flows downhill, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest slope in the neighbourhood. They call it the \"workout hill\" because many joggers like to run up it as part of their daily routine. Since there are no sidewalks on my street, people walk on the road. The road itself is pitted in some places and can be a bit hazardous to drive on due to several potholes. The telephone and electric wires strung around the block look tattered, and with the frequent rain and storms, branches and debris often knock them down, requiring constant repairs. As a result, they appear patchwork-y and worn out. The area is filled with tall evergreen trees, but the residents dislike them, viewing them as obstructing the ocean view. To compensate, many houses are built high up on the hill, with large glass-fronted second-storey sections that offer a stunning view of the bay. When the sun sets, the water seems to be lit up from below, and the sky turns a vibrant orange. However, it's cloudy most days, so the sunlight often gets filtered through the haze. The weather is mostly overcast and damp, with moss growing on everything it can, from roofs to cars to railings. I once left my car in the driveway for a month, and when I returned, it had turned green and furry with moss, taking three hours to clean off. My neighbourhood is mostly home to older residents, many of whom are retired. In contrast to children, dogs are a common sight in our area, often seen lounging in people's yards or racing down the street. If you leave a door or window open, they might sneak into your house. I once found one in my living room and had to shoo it out the front door. Rabbits are also rampant in the area, digging up roots and burrowing into lawns, much to the dismay of the gardeners. My cats, however, love them and have managed to hunt most of them out of our neighbourhood. The area is also home to a variety of birds, including small sparrows and hummingbirds, as well as the occasional hawk or eagle that soars by until chased off by the neighbourhood crows. If you're willing to hike downhill to the waterfront, you can find a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. The shoreline itself is narrow, but the rocks along the shore make for fun places to throw stones into the water. The bay is not wide, and on most days, you can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist.",
            "We live in a small neighborhood in a southern Tennessee town, situated on a street that connects two state highways. The traffic can get pretty busy, but overall, it's a quiet and peaceful area. I've gotten used to the familiar faces of my neighbors, who keep busy with yard work and daily chores. In the winter, my family and I sled down the hill on our side street, enjoying the thrill of the ride. Our house is at the front corner of the street, so we see everyone passing by and have a good idea of who lives around here. Whenever a new car appears, we take notice. Some neighbors walk their dogs or exercise, while the kids ride their bikes. We spend a lot of time at home, working from there, and our family of four - my wife, our two daughters (11 and 14 years old) - is pretty used to seeing us come and go. We love spending time outside, even on rainy days, and occasionally we fire up the grill on our back deck, filling the air with the delicious smell of barbecue. The sound of lawn mowers fills the air from March to October, reminding us that the grass is growing. Our neighborhood was once wooded, so we have plenty of shade and beautiful trees, but also a lot of leaves in the fall, which means regular raking and burning. We enjoy the smell of burning leaves, signaling the arrival of fall. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we mainly use the back door, unless someone knocks on the front door, which is a rare occurrence. When I work on my truck or other projects in the garage, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. On holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas, the neighborhood is quiet, except for the occasional visitors and extra cars parked around. It's a great place to live, and if it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "Yesterday, I reflected on my neighborhood in the high desert. It's like being smack in the middle of a vast expanse of dirt, with not a speck of green in sight. People who haven't experienced living here might not grasp the feeling of seeing nothing but brown every time they step out. When I first arrived in the 90s, the houses were scattered far apart. Now, it's the same, with new additions sprouting up everywhere. Our neighborhood is transforming into a city, but it's happening everywhere, not just here. Most people are friendly, but like any urban area, there are good and bad parts. I'm surrounded by friendly seniors, so I feel pretty lucky to live here. The local stores are mostly chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want to find something unique, you have to head elsewhere. Construction is the most prominent industry in our area, and I think it's because this city is still relatively undeveloped, leaving plenty of open space to build. To be honest, it worries me - I prefer things the way they are now. I left the city to escape the chaos and don't want to go back. Speaking of construction, my job as a drywall and T-bar installer is right in this field. What I love about my home is the wildlife. People come to the high desert for its breathtaking beauty, but it also has a unique ecosystem that needs protection. We have a responsibility to learn about the animals that call this place home so we can coexist peacefully. I've got three kids, and they're just like me - they're fascinated by lizards and desert bugs. Right now, they're outside trying to catch different species. As for attractions, we've got a few things to offer. Victorville is a great place for families to experience the desert. If you plan your visit during the San Bernardino County Fair, you'll get a memorable experience. Head to Wrightwood to see the snow-capped mountains and take some winter sports lessons to cap off your trip. If you're interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert, the Victor Valley Museum has an impressive collection of geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of how our community developed and thrived.",
            "To describe my neighborhood, I'd say my answer is pretty one-of-a-kind. While others might think of their neighborhood as a typical residential area, mine's a bit different. For me, my neighborhood is actually the college campus I stay on, and the people in my dorm are like my community. I also consider the surrounding campus as part of my neighborhood, but to a lesser extent. Despite being a bit unconventional, my neighborhood shares some familiar traits with the usual idea of a neighborhood. Like any ordinary neighborhood, it's got houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's start with the 'houses' that make up my neighborhood. Before diving into the specifics, I should clarify the different types of housing in my vicinity. There are three main types: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory houses. First, in the apartments, each room usually has 2-4 people, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor, making each building home to around 20 people. Then, there are the actual houses that are available for rent for those affiliated with the school - usually 2-4 bedroom setups, often occupied by alumni, but there aren't many of these around. Lastly, there are the dorm rooms, which house hundreds of students, typically with two people sharing a room, except in some cases. These are the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered, let's move on to the people. My school's all about diversity, and that's reflected in the mix of cultures and ages living in my neighborhood. The professional staff live in the houses, while newer students stay in dorms and older students stay in apartments. It's hard to do justice to the people in my neighborhood, so let's skip to the stores and parks. Since my school is essentially its own self-contained neighborhood, it has plenty of stores and a single park. The stores offer a mix of dining options and the school's own brand of clothing and grocery stores, so you can find everything you need within the neighborhood. The park's a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, kept clean and safe thanks to everyone's efforts.",
            "I must say that after being here for about a decade, I've got some stories to share. I still remember the day I moved here to this neighborhood, I was really down, coming from Riverdale to Stockbridge. It was tough, I won't deny it, I missed them and the life we had there, but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sis, so we packed up and moved to a new place with better housing and a better high school. It was a big change, but over the years, I got used to it and made some new friends and, unfortunately, some new enemies at school too. One thing that's stuck with me is that I never really took the time to get to know my neighbors, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis, who we were lucky to have living next door. They've been like family to me, and I'm really grateful to have them. I remember when my family and I went to Mr. Glen's wedding; it was an amazing experience, and I'm hoping to have something similar one day when I'm older and settled. When Ms. Veda took off her wedding anklet and threw it, I was quick enough to catch it, but I wish I'd caught the flowers too! We danced the night away, and I had a blast with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I've lost touch with her since, but I hope she's doing great. The neighborhood can be confusing, but now that I have a GPS, it's easier to explore. I've only gone so far, mostly hanging out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We used to spend hours playing video games and living life to the fullest. I'd also head to the park to enjoy nature, which really calms me down and gives me a sense of peace. I'd bring sticks and practice my balance, and sometimes I'd bring my bokken sword if I could. It's great to do what I love. We also have a basketball and tennis court, even though I haven't played either sport in a while, it's good to have them around just in case I decide to pick them up again. My dad got me and my best friend into tennis with Mr. Graves, and we always had a blast, even though they pushed us hard. I'm sure there are plenty of more stories from my time here, but these are the things that really stand out, and who knows, the best is yet to come.",
            "The college that I attend is actually just nearby my place, which I must say I'm pretty fortunate about. I live in an apartment building, but there are a few restaurants and bars around that are pretty cool to hang out at, and they're not too pricey. I recently heard that one of the bars has been renamed, and it's a bit more expensive than the others, but the service and drinks aren't too bad. The people in the area are pretty nice, and since it's a college town, there are mostly students and low-income individuals living in the apartment buildings. You can also tell that there are a lot of families around, probably because there's an elementary school within walking distance from my apartment. I don't really know my neighbors, and to be honest, I don't particularly want to. They smoke a lot of weed, and our apartment management decided to put an air freshener unit right outside their door, which my boyfriend and I found pretty amusing. It's almost as if they're mocking us. The apartment buildings around me are mostly old-looking on the outside, but they might have been renovated inside. A bit further down the street, there are brand new apartments, but I don't really like them. I think the construction quality isn't that great, and the rent is super high, which I think is a bit unfair. Since they're close to the campus, the management of those buildings can get away with charging us exorbitant rent. There's this really cheap restaurant just a few minutes from my place that serves food on paper plates and most of it is microwaved. Across from that place is a gas station, which I've heard isn't a great place to work. However, thanks to some funding from the city, the road was renovated last summer, so now there's a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and the area looks a bit better. But my apartment building is actually pretty shaded, with lots of trees around it. They cut down a few of them, so there are a few stumps left behind, but there are still a lot of trees around my place compared to the other street. Behind my apartment complex is a row of trees, and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind it is 43rd street, and that one's not as nice. The sidewalks on that street are pretty bad and are falling apart, and most of the buildings look pretty run-down. There are a lot of trees on that street, but it's probably just to hide the state of the buildings. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but I don't think it's fair to blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But overall, I like living here. The rent is affordable, and there are plenty of useful amenities nearby, including the university, which is within walking distance, and there are two bus stops so I can easily get to the store and downtown.",
            "My current neighborhood is comprised of rows of duplex's in a cul-de-sac. They appear to be individual houses due to the intermittent placement and spacing, although they are painted the same, with yellow walls, white porches, and green metal roofs. Most of the residents are on friendly terms with one another, which adds to the communal atmosphere. Every evening, some of us stand at the end of our driveways and engage in casual conversations while the kids in the neighborhood play with their toys, create art with sidewalk chalk, or fly their kites. This setting is a refreshing escape from the monotony of the modern world, which is dominated by technology and computers. It's as if we're living in a bygone era. The surroundings are picturesque, with fields and trees accompanied by blue skies and puffy white clouds. However, this season has brought us tornado warnings, and for the first time, we actually heard the tornado sirens last night, prompting us to seek shelter. I, along with my little dog, found myself in the bathtub, clutching my purse and a few pillows. My larger dog, however, remained in the living room, whining and barking nervously due to the unusual circumstances. The neighborhood was eerily quiet, except for the sound of large hail pounding against the ground. After the storm passed, the road was steaming due to the dramatic temperature change, with the hail melting as soon as it hit the hot pavement. As I gazed up at the clearing skies, the sun broke through, and it began to rain. A double rainbow appeared, and I quickly ran inside to grab my camera to capture the moment. I shared the photos with my friends and family on Facebook, and they were just as amazed as I was. The streets remained quiet for another hour before people started returning home, and then it was back to normal – moms and kids outside, dinner being cooked. I've grown to adore this friendly neighborhood, especially the southern accent that's become music to my ears. Although all the houses appear identical on the outside, each apartment has its own unique layout and charm. Some are surprisingly small, which I find hard to understand. I enjoy taking leisurely walks through the largest field behind my home and strolling down to the pond, which isn't suitable for swimming. I've spotted deer, and in the mornings, you can hear the deep, resonant song of the bullfrog. It's a fantastic place to live, just a forty-minute drive away from the city of Charlotte. Each morning is a beautiful start, accompanied by the sounds of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It's as if we're living in a small, self-contained community. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that lets out a distinctive bray in the evenings, serving as a gentle reminder of his presence. I feel fortunate to have found this hidden gem of a neighborhood.",
            "It was my first day of eighth grade when I moved into this neighborhood. Making friends wasn't easy at first, but luckily I connected with two of my neighbors - one living two houses down and another on my street. Unfortunately, they've since moved away, but the memories still linger. To my surprise, most of the original residents who welcomed me when I first arrived are still here. Our neighborhood is pretty much your typical American suburban setup - rows of two-story houses and the usual sounds of kids playing outside on warm days. Weekends are usually pretty quiet, but when it's warm, you can hear the laughter of kids outside. I've been fortunate to have never had any issues with my neighbors, and it's clear that this is a community where you're left alone unless you genuinely need help. Online deliveries have become a norm, and I've ordered multiple times without ever having a package go missing from my porch. This speaks volumes about the trust my neighbors have in each other. A park just a minute or two away has been a hub for some of my fondest memories, including playing basketball, football, and baseball with my neighborhood friends. However, it's also where I suffered a painful injury when I got elbowed in the nose during a football game. The good memories far outweigh the bad, though. Nowadays, I visit the park to spend quality time with my cousin's younger kids, who still love playing on the swings and slides. Watching them brings back a mix of emotions, making me nostalgic for my past experiences there. The neighborhood is a melting pot of cultures, with an array of cuisines nearby. Just within a one-mile radius, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants, as well as plenty of fast-food shops and pizza places. Online food delivery services like GrubHub and DoorDash have become increasingly popular, though. The local stores cater to all our needs, with multiple dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store on the same street. There's even an Indian-owned store for those who crave homemade or ready-made Indian food. After seeing the unfortunate stories of neighborly conflicts on social media and news, I feel grateful to live in a neighborhood where I can trust my neighbors.",
            "My hometown is a charming little town in South Carolina that doesn't stand out from the rest, but it's a significant contributor to the agriculture sector. Johnston claims to be the Peach Capital of the World, a title proudly displayed on the town's welcoming sign. Its main landscape consists of farmland where peach trees and cattle dominate the scene. Houses, mostly two-story affairs with metal or gray roofs to combat the scorching summer heat, are scattered throughout the outskirts of town. They're often set back from the road, allowing the front fields to be used for grazing animals and crops. The central part of town features a single stoplight at an intersection, where the few shops are located. A small Chinese restaurant called Hong Kong, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a local burger chain, offer limited dining options. A former pizzeria has since closed down. There's a small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug, famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola. A tiny grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, is the town's sole grocery store, but many residents prefer to shop at the nearby Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville. However, the most bustling spot in town is Dollar General, which sells a vast array of everyday items and is always crowded from opening to closing. A small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind-hearted woman, has been a staple in Johnston for years and even employs delivery services. Adjacent to the furniture store is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet groomer offering various services. Both a doctor's office and a veterinary clinic are located outside the main town area, providing essential services to the residents. The town has a single elementary school, Johnston Elementary School, but students attend middle and high school in the next town over after completing the fifth grade. Although there aren't many recreational activities, the town is working on creating a 2.5-acre recreational area to attract visitors and potential residents. While it's a quiet town with limited amenities, it's still a pleasant place to live, so small that you could easily miss it in the blink of an eye.",
            "The first time I heard about my neighborhood, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It caught me off guard. Almost every apartment in the area was renting for over a thousand dollars a month, but I'd never heard anything about this story. Neither had my friends. It's like the darkness that settles in when you're struggling. I know some of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night due to financial struggles. We've learned to be thrifty over the years, but it's funny how you start to appreciate the smell of second-hand items and old clothes. You even start to enjoy the smell of stale air. As an adult, you might start smoking or just get used to the way things are. But the thrift stores in my area never fail to remind me of this reality. There are three within walking distance, and if you start from the far end, you'll find charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. The townscape may be chaotic, with cars and people packed into the streets every morning, but the thrift stores are always quiet. It's the perfect place to lose an afternoon. Every year, the city grows more crowded with cars and people. It's a developing city, they say, and it's home to one of the largest e-commerce empires. It reminds me of New York, where everyone's focused on their goals and nobody bothers you. You can keep to yourself, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where people seem to pry into your life. In this city, you can keep your shell intact, and the city will just roll on like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be, with the pianist next door and the amateur vocalists upstairs always creating something new. We don't live in a typical apartment of strangers; instead, we're a community of friends who come together for birthdays, funerals, and when we need help. I'm lucky to be here, and I really like most of my neighbors. We look out for each other, clean up after ourselves, and share food and mail. It's nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. Despite living in a massive modernist sprawl, my neighbors make me feel like I haven't completely messed up my life.",
            "I live in a typical suburban area, nothing out of the ordinary. My neighborhood is like a cookie cutter version of suburban living. Everywhere you look, you'll see well-maintained single family homes, thanks to our homeowner's association. The front yards all share a similar theme: a small patch of neatly cut grass, some decorative pebbles, and short driveways. You'll also spot small trees scattered here and there. Every house has two-car garages. As you drive through the neighborhood, you'll notice newly paved concrete roads in excellent condition – no potholes or bumps in sight. Most of the homes are one-story, but some have two stories as well. What sets our neighborhood apart is the mail system. Instead of individual mailboxes in front of each house, we have a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street that require a key to access. We also have two big package lockers, courtesy of our HOA's love for uniformity. Our neighborhood is on the outskirts of the nearby city, so it's a mix of rural and suburban living. We have plenty of open land and a range of amenities, including multiple community pools that are well-maintained and gated. There are also walking trails where you can take your dog for a walk or go for a solo evening stroll. Exercise isn't a problem here – you can simply run around the neighborhood and get your daily dose of exercise. Our community is predominantly made up of retirees, but we also have a mix of middle-aged and young professionals. The city itself is surprisingly large, with a small-town feel. We have all the amenities you'd expect, including a single mall that may not be huge, but gets the job done. It takes me about 15 minutes to drive to anywhere significant, but once I get there, I have access to a variety of stores, from high-end grocery stores to bargain outlets. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty standard – we have our nice touches like pools and walking trails, and while we're not right next door to any shopping centers, it's an easy drive to get to any major chain store I want.",
            "I reside in a small Midwestern town situated just outside the suburban outskirts of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, located on the east side, is considered the most economically disadvantaged area within the town. Property values are on the lower side, with most houses rented or owned by low-income individuals, yet it's far from unattractive or unpleasant. The people in my neighborhood are generally friendly and always greet me with a smile when I walk down the street. Crime rates are slightly higher than in other parts of town, but still relatively low. In the past decade, a few violent crimes have occurred close to my home, including shootings and a homicide. Our next-door neighbors recently lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar. Fortunately, my family hasn't been directly affected by crime, except for occasionally losing items from our porch when we forget to bring them inside. Our town has been greatly impacted by the \"opioid epidemic\" affecting many parts of the United States. Unfortunately, many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are numerous resources available to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those struggling with addiction. Despite the challenges, my town has many positive qualities. My son's elementary school has an excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. He has special needs, yet he hasn't faced any bullying due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he truly loves attending. We have an active PTO that organizes multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Given that over 20% of our town's population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child ever goes hungry. No child or family is treated as less than due to financial constraints, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are reasonable. The City Council and staff have implemented various improvements to our town's appearance, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the town center and on the west side, where shopping areas are located and most traffic passes through. In contrast, the east side, where I live, tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for my neighbors and me. Despite these issues, I genuinely enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are excellent, there are sufficient shopping options to meet my family's needs, and while our home may not be worth much, it is comfortable and suitable. We've lived here for over 16 years, and it's hard to imagine calling anywhere else home.",
            "My neighborhood is a vibrant cultural hub, nestled on a hill surrounded by buildings steeped in history. I live in a 7-story apartment building right opposite the old theater, and just down the road, you'll find a trendy arcade bar that draws in a diverse crowd on warm summer evenings. The line of people waiting to get in is a common sight, especially during weekends in June and July. A short walk up is the city park, a decent size considering its location. The park is encircled by concrete, with steep stairs carved into the wall. During the harsh winter months, you'll see homeless people setting up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and wide steps. Although it doesn't snow often, the heavy rainfall in mid-winter can be challenging to cope with. By setting their tents close together in the city center, they stay relatively warmer. They're also close to the local family center, where they can access basic necessities like showers and baths. What I love about my city isn't its historic architecture or the hills that roll down to the ocean. It's the people themselves who make my neighborhood so special. You see, Hilltop was once notorious for gang violence on the West Coast, and stories of federal officials and the DEA sweeping through the area still circulate today. The community still remembers those days. Despite being considered one of the rougher neighborhoods in the city, the people work hard to keep it clean and safe. They still care about what happens in their area, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill at night, but I think this warning is a relic of the past, tainted with social conditioning. Perhaps it's because I blend in as a 'not-so-white' person, or maybe the Hilltop community recognizes me as one of their own, someone who's just as aware of the reminders that plague our nation. These reminders are a result of racism, cultural conditioning, and ignorance-fueled assumptions, even in a city that prides itself as a cultural melting pot. I know one thing: no matter where life takes me, Hilltop will always be home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who've shown me kindness and compassion, even when I needed it most. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open late to charge my phone when I was stranded in the rain. It's a place where I've sat, feeling invisible, huddled against a concrete storefront on a bleak night, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I reside in Rural America, a small town in Michigan. The landscape here is a beautiful mix of farmland and quaint tourist cities. We don't have the big city luxuries like malls, chain stores like Wal-mart or Target, or even a fancy restaurant like Applebee's. Everything you need is within driving distance. Despite this, our little town is surrounded by breathtaking natural beauty - the stunning waters of Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Every corner of our \"city\" offers access to a beach where you can dip your toes in the water. Our neighborhood perfectly embodies the essence of small-town life. Houses are spread out, not towering on top of each other like in big cities. They're a mix of old and new, with some homes dating back years and others beautifully renovated. Most houses have full basements that are visible from the road, giving them a charming, down-to-earth feel. The neighborhood is a kaleidoscope of colors, with houses painted in every hue imaginable. Yards are a common feature, with trampolines, playsets, and even gardens and fences for pets. The atmosphere is quintessentially Middle American - hardworking folks striving to make a living, some raising families and others having already done so. On any given day, you'll see kids running up and down the streets, people walking their dogs, biking, or rollerblading. Neighbors know and look out for one another, and you can quickly tell who's part of the community and who's an outsider. You'll see people grilling in their front yards, waving at passersby, or walking their dogs and exchanging pleasantries with neighbors a few blocks away. Lawns are well-maintained, with neatly trimmed grass and tidy gardens. It's not a neighborhood that will leave you awestruck, but one that exudes a sense of comfort and security. It's a quiet, peaceful place where you can feel safe, and that's exactly what people want in life. Within walking distance, you'll find the county sheriff's department, the health department, and the recycling center, which serves the entire city. We have baseball and softball fields nearby, where you can hear the announcers calling out the names of players and keeping score. The small town airport is just a stone's throw away, and you can often hear the sound of small planes taking off and landing. You can also walk to the local ice cream shop or head downtown from our neighborhood. My kids can ride their bikes to the nearby park, which is just an 8-block ride away. It's a wonderful place to call home."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "Yesterday, I pondered the diversity of my neighborhood in this large city.  Residential areas are scattered randomly between commercial ones, where you can find a variety of businesses like offices, stores, restaurants, and entertainment spots. There's no shortage of restaurants to dine at and stores to shop from. While some stores are well-known brands owned by large corporations, others are small boutiques that are increasingly popular. These boutiques line the streets and are within walking distance of quiet neighborhoods that would otherwise be serene. There are also nearby parks where people take their young children to spend quality time. As for the people, my neighborhood is surprisingly diverse. In one small area, you'll find a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a group of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. If you venture out, you'll find even more people from different racial and ethnic backgrounds, although they tend to form their own communities within the city. There are areas known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and more, just a few miles away. However, those few miles can be a lengthy drive due to traffic, especially during rush hour. It's no surprise that hardly anyone walks anywhere in my city. With some attractions within walking distance, the city is huge, and people generally prefer not to commute on foot. As a result, the city is plagued by terrible traffic, and parking spots are scarce. Ironically, there's been a lot of construction lately, with new apartment buildings popping up. It seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are worried that it'll only lead to more people and traffic. My city has a mix of different types of houses, ranging from large apartment buildings to smaller houses and condominiums. Some properties are single-family homes, while others are duplexes. Even within my immediate neighborhood, there's a variety of housing options. The neighborhood is also home to people of all ages, and I must admit that I'm not familiar with most of my neighbors. It's not the kind of close-knit community it used to be, but I do have fond memories of playing with my next-door neighbor and a few other friends from the neighborhood when I was younger.",
            "My neighborhood is an interesting place. It's a mix of single-family homes, though some have been split into two, still connected, if you can imagine that. My house has a small front yard and a driveway to its left, just like most of the others. It's a reminder of the 'American dream,' a concept that once seemed to capture the hearts of this nation, but now seems to be slipping away. Yet, my neighborhood and many others still stand as a testament to that dream, holding onto it as tightly as we can. The people here don't feel as optimistic as they used to; the upkeep of the lawns isn't what it once was, but you can still spot a car or two in every driveway, and the youth still play as if nothing's wrong. Our public school, which has been here for almost 90 years, still stands, inspiring a sense of possibility in the youth and nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, but the basketball courts are always bustling. Every house looks different, yet feels the same. We have a large supermarket called 'Super A,' which has been run by a Yemni family, who are possibly the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The majority of residents are African American. The streets are wide, and the kids play football, pausing only to let cars pass. Many of us have lived here for generations, and we all have stories to share about a time when everyone knew everyone. We had a karate school, but when the fad died down, it became a pharmacy, because, as they say, \"a pill can fix everything.\" We also have a small movie theater that shows old films at a discounted price, a place the youth avoids due to its outdated titles, but the elders cherish it as a way to spend a night out without the kids. There's a single expressway that runs through our town, though the entrance and exit are in the town next door. There was a petition to get an exit for our town, but the youth supported it, while the elders opposed it, fearing it would ruin our town. We're building a new high school, and we're struggling to decide on a mascot for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the perfect representation of our town.",
            "At first glance, it may seem like just any other residential area - tucked away behind a shopping strip, it's not a place you'd expect to find a thriving community. But look closer, and you'll discover an entire world hidden behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and the hotels that are only occasionally occupied except for family reunions during the summer. Behind these buildings lies a bustling neighborhood, complete with a series of apartment complexes side by side like Russian nesting dolls carefully arranged on the street. One complex has seen its fair share of controversy, but we'll set that aside for now. The others nearby, however, paint a vastly different picture.\n\nNearby, a community college's satellite campus stands quietly by the road, its sleepy buildings a stark contrast to the hustle and bustle of the surrounding area. Students shuffle in for their morning classes, yawning and sipping their coffee as the iron gates creak open to let them in. Commuters driving by curse at the traffic congestion caused by the students. Down the road, a park and a rehabilitation center provide a stark contrast to the busy campus. The rehab center boasts a cheerful porch and a lazily turning ceiling fan, while children play tag in the park across the street, their laughter and shouts mingling with the buzzing bees in the nearby flower patches. Retirees stroll their dogs along the walking path, scowling at the teens on skateboards and nodding politely at the girls gossiping by the playground.\n\nIn a nearby strip mall, you can find a sushi restaurant with affordable food but rarely any crowd, a swimming supply store, and a nail salon nestled in between. It's possible to fill up your pool and get a manicure while enjoying hibachi chicken, all in one stop - the epitome of convenience. There's also a DIY frozen yogurt shop where teens often gather to do tricks on their skateboards and vape, sipping cold, dripping cups of frozen yogurt topped with their favorite treats. This little neighborhood is a slice of quintessential America, frozen in time and changeless, much like the sleepy south that surrounds it.",
            "As we cruised past the endless cornfields which stretched as far as my eyes could see, she asked, \"Where is everything?\" I knew she'd be taken aback by the bare expanses of open land. Coming from a town where the nearest grocery store was just a 5-minute walk away, she'd never experienced this much space before. I filled her in on what it was like growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood me and where I'm from. We drove along a two-lane country road, passing by a quarry filled with water before reaching my small development. The houses here are mostly brick and stucco, each with a lush half-acre of land that the residents take great pride in maintaining. Come spring, the annual flowers bloom alongside the midwestern trees that change with the seasons. The driveways are lined with sleek Mercedes-Benz luxury cars, glistening in the sunlight after a good wash. My home, a grey stucco house, came into view, and I pointed out my friendly Korean neighbor, who's always tending to his lawn and singing along to the hum of his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Everyone in the neighborhood loves him for his genuine and unique personality. He's aged and lost some of his wit, but his past as a doctor is still evident. As we continued down the road, I showed her the side yard, where geese roam free and are chased by our feisty Terrier. The backyard has a small stream that feeds into the quarry, where you can hear the soothing sounds of bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional \"moo\" from the nearby farms. Across a handmade wooden bridge lies an untouched oasis, teeming with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This is where I spent most of my childhood, building tree forts, playing \"hunt\" (which mostly involved chasing animals), and having neighborhood friends to share in the fun. Winters in my hometown can be harsh, but there's something beautiful about it. The yard transforms from a lush green to a barren wilderness, and the trees that once bloomed with vibrant flowers turn into skeletal branches. When snow falls, a winter wonderland appears overnight, and the backyard is filled with snow angels and snowmen made by my little sister and me. We fought frequently as kids, but during the winter, snowballs were our go-to weapon. We'd build massive forts to house our arsenal, using branches and our imaginations to create our own little wonderland – a place where we were carefree, just kids without a worry in the world.",
            "To truly grasp the essence of Portland, Oregon, one must first understand what being \"weird\" truly means. The unofficial town motto, proudly plastered on a building that defies categorization as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, and strip club, all while skirting the law, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, this phrase is a nostalgic reminder of the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's - a lesser-known, more affordable city that fostered unique and creative subcultures. For others, it's an invitation to come to Portland, where the term \"weird\" is now a badge of honor. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the relentless construction of high-rise condos to accommodate them, Portland remains stubbornly eccentric. Being weird doesn't mean being judgmental or exclusive, but rather accepting of things that wouldn't normally be accepted. We have our modern amenities and our share of modern issues, just like the rest of the country - we import most of our goods from China. There are countless ways to be weird, to be unconventional, but Portland has its fair share of the ordinary. You'll find yoga enthusiasts, hipsters, and suit-and-tie professionals living alongside one another. Perhaps \"weird\" simply means we don't take ourselves too seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, you'll find vibrant houses, home gardens bursting with flowers, herbs, and vegetables, and free boxes lining the streets during the summer months. Free boxes are essentially discarded items - often cardboard, sometimes plastic - containing treasures perfect for the passerby. They can hold anything from clothes and books to who-knows-what, and the thrill of the hunt is all part of the magic. This is what Portland is all about to me, but I'm just one of the many weird and wonderful souls that call this city home. Some people I live among would never dream of scavenging through a box on the sidewalk, opting instead for goat yoga or Timbers matches. Portland is a city of people with diverse passions and pursuits - we're a city of dreamers, both those who are actively chasing their dreams and those who spend too much time at the bar, lost in thought. Of course, like every city, Portland struggles with its fair share of problems, including a drug epidemic that often stems from underlying mental health issues. The constant rain and grey skies don't help, but neither do we. We also grapple with homelessness, a complex issue that seems to plague every major city in the country. Our social services are better than many other places, but they're still woefully insufficient. The non-homeless population is torn between empathy and frustration, and in this, we're not at all weird - just like any other city facing similar challenges.",
            "The mountains have been consistent witnesses to the passage of time, silently standing tall in the north as the sun rises and sets each day. They remain steadfast, unperturbed by life's turmoil, and unwavering in their presence. Even when I'm consumed by work and life's demands, they're there, always a constant in my life. On days when I'm feeling overwhelmed and drained, they beckon me to take a step back and rest my anxious soul, offering me the strength to carry on, day by day. It was during my undergrad days that I first fell in love with the mountains north of campus. While the university itself boasts its own unique charm, with its beautiful buildings, ponds, and trees, it's the mountains that hold a special place in my heart. Beyond the campus, the town itself has its own beauty. There are numerous cozy cafes where I spent countless hours fuelled by caffeine and cramming, and just a short walk away lies the downtown area, where the faded brick buildings exude an air of antiquity. This blend of old and new, bustling and serene, creates a captivating atmosphere that invites exploration. As a result, I've created many cherished memories in this town, each tied to a specific location. Whether it's strolling past the rusty swings in the park with friends after a long night of studying or racing through the downtown area to catch a movie in the university's cinema, this town has been a witness to many moments of joy and laughter. However, it's also a place of painful memories, as is true with any place in life. The ponds, in particular, have become a refuge for both reflection and late-night tears during moments of existential crisis. As I watch the turtles, ducks, and insects living their lives, each contributing to the ecosystem, I'm reminded of my own search for purpose. And so, I'd walk past the pond, the park, and the small houses that epitomize suburban life, until I reached the main street. It was then that I'd gaze up at the sunrise, and as the palm trees stood tall beneath it, I'd feel the warmth of the sun's rays. That's when I'd look north and see them: the sturdy, majestic mountains, their peaks grazing the hazy blue and yellow sky. In that moment, they'd stir something deep within me, a sense of resilience that has guided me through life's challenges.",
            "Bensonhurst is quite easy to find if you're planning on visiting. The public transportation system is very accessible, making it one of the most popular modes of transportation in New York City. As you walk through the neighborhood, you'll get a true taste of the city vibe. You'll see a plethora of Asian stores all around, which are a result of the influx of Asian inhabitants over the past two decades. It's not uncommon to spot an Asian-owned store on almost every block. Supermarkets and laundromats are particularly popular, not just among locals but also among visitors, thanks to their affordable prices, high-quality food, and convenient locations. In fact, I'm lucky enough to have four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk of each other, making grocery shopping a breeze. While Bensonhurst is predominantly Asian, it's not homogeneous – you'll find a mix of immigrants, first-generation and second-generation American kids, and a diverse community. The majority of big businesses in the area are Asian-owned, but you'll also find a beautifully renovated park nearby, complete with ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, a playground, and a water fountain for kids to enjoy during the summer. The park is a melting pot of diversity, where people from different backgrounds can come together and get along. When it comes to living spaces, you won't find many high-rise corporate buildings. Instead, you'll see co-op living buildings and condominium apartments, with two-family houses being the most common type of residence. While the people here are generally nice, they can be quite loud. You'll often hear cars blasting music as they drive by, or people flooring it on the gas, which can make for an early morning wake-up call. If you're planning a night visit, be cautious; while the neighborhood is generally safe, you never know who you might run into. Be prepared to encounter people who might start trouble for no reason, bullies, and even thieves. I've had my own share of run-ins with bullies in the past, but thankfully, it was a long time ago. More recently, there have been cases of package theft in the area. Lastly, be aware that people in this neighborhood don't always follow the rules, like cleaning up after their dogs. You'll often see dog waste on the sidewalk, which can be quite frustrating. Just be careful where you step and make sure to keep your shoes clean!",
            "Where I live, the sidewalks are scarce. It's like everything flows downhill, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest slope in the neighbourhood. They call it the \"workout hill\" because many joggers like to run up it as part of their daily routine. Since there are no sidewalks on my street, people walk on the road. The road itself is pitted in some places and can be a bit hazardous to drive on due to several potholes. The telephone and electric wires strung around the block look tattered, and with the frequent rain and storms, branches and debris often knock them down, requiring constant repairs. As a result, they appear patchwork-y and worn out. The area is filled with tall evergreen trees, but the residents dislike them, viewing them as obstructing the ocean view. To compensate, many houses are built high up on the hill, with large glass-fronted second-storey sections that offer a stunning view of the bay. When the sun sets, the water seems to be lit up from below, and the sky turns a vibrant orange. However, it's cloudy most days, so the sunlight often gets filtered through the haze. The weather is mostly overcast and damp, with moss growing on everything it can, from roofs to cars to railings. I once left my car in the driveway for a month, and when I returned, it had turned green and furry with moss, taking three hours to clean off. My neighbourhood is mostly home to older residents, many of whom are retired. In contrast to children, dogs are a common sight in our area, often seen lounging in people's yards or racing down the street. If you leave a door or window open, they might sneak into your house. I once found one in my living room and had to shoo it out the front door. Rabbits are also rampant in the area, digging up roots and burrowing into lawns, much to the dismay of the gardeners. My cats, however, love them and have managed to hunt most of them out of our neighbourhood. The area is also home to a variety of birds, including small sparrows and hummingbirds, as well as the occasional hawk or eagle that soars by until chased off by the neighbourhood crows. If you're willing to hike downhill to the waterfront, you can find a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. The shoreline itself is narrow, but the rocks along the shore make for fun places to throw stones into the water. The bay is not wide, and on most days, you can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist.",
            "We live in a small neighborhood in a southern Tennessee town, situated on a street that connects two state highways. The traffic can get pretty busy, but overall, it's a quiet and peaceful area. I've gotten used to the familiar faces of my neighbors, who keep busy with yard work and daily chores. In the winter, my family and I sled down the hill on our side street, enjoying the thrill of the ride. Our house is at the front corner of the street, so we see everyone passing by and have a good idea of who lives around here. Whenever a new car appears, we take notice. Some neighbors walk their dogs or exercise, while the kids ride their bikes. We spend a lot of time at home, working from there, and our family of four - my wife, our two daughters (11 and 14 years old) - is pretty used to seeing us come and go. We love spending time outside, even on rainy days, and occasionally we fire up the grill on our back deck, filling the air with the delicious smell of barbecue. The sound of lawn mowers fills the air from March to October, reminding us that the grass is growing. Our neighborhood was once wooded, so we have plenty of shade and beautiful trees, but also a lot of leaves in the fall, which means regular raking and burning. We enjoy the smell of burning leaves, signaling the arrival of fall. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we mainly use the back door, unless someone knocks on the front door, which is a rare occurrence. When I work on my truck or other projects in the garage, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. On holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas, the neighborhood is quiet, except for the occasional visitors and extra cars parked around. It's a great place to live, and if it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "Yesterday, I reflected on my neighborhood in the high desert. It's like being smack in the middle of a vast expanse of dirt, with not a speck of green in sight. People who haven't experienced living here might not grasp the feeling of seeing nothing but brown every time they step out. When I first arrived in the 90s, the houses were scattered far apart. Now, it's the same, with new additions sprouting up everywhere. Our neighborhood is transforming into a city, but it's happening everywhere, not just here. Most people are friendly, but like any urban area, there are good and bad parts. I'm surrounded by friendly seniors, so I feel pretty lucky to live here. The local stores are mostly chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want to find something unique, you have to head elsewhere. Construction is the most prominent industry in our area, and I think it's because this city is still relatively undeveloped, leaving plenty of open space to build. To be honest, it worries me - I prefer things the way they are now. I left the city to escape the chaos and don't want to go back. Speaking of construction, my job as a drywall and T-bar installer is right in this field. What I love about my home is the wildlife. People come to the high desert for its breathtaking beauty, but it also has a unique ecosystem that needs protection. We have a responsibility to learn about the animals that call this place home so we can coexist peacefully. I've got three kids, and they're just like me - they're fascinated by lizards and desert bugs. Right now, they're outside trying to catch different species. As for attractions, we've got a few things to offer. Victorville is a great place for families to experience the desert. If you plan your visit during the San Bernardino County Fair, you'll get a memorable experience. Head to Wrightwood to see the snow-capped mountains and take some winter sports lessons to cap off your trip. If you're interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert, the Victor Valley Museum has an impressive collection of geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of how our community developed and thrived.",
            "To describe my neighborhood, I'd say my answer is pretty one-of-a-kind. While others might think of their neighborhood as a typical residential area, mine's a bit different. For me, my neighborhood is actually the college campus I stay on, and the people in my dorm are like my community. I also consider the surrounding campus as part of my neighborhood, but to a lesser extent. Despite being a bit unconventional, my neighborhood shares some familiar traits with the usual idea of a neighborhood. Like any ordinary neighborhood, it's got houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's start with the 'houses' that make up my neighborhood. Before diving into the specifics, I should clarify the different types of housing in my vicinity. There are three main types: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory houses. First, in the apartments, each room usually has 2-4 people, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor, making each building home to around 20 people. Then, there are the actual houses that are available for rent for those affiliated with the school - usually 2-4 bedroom setups, often occupied by alumni, but there aren't many of these around. Lastly, there are the dorm rooms, which house hundreds of students, typically with two people sharing a room, except in some cases. These are the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered, let's move on to the people. My school's all about diversity, and that's reflected in the mix of cultures and ages living in my neighborhood. The professional staff live in the houses, while newer students stay in dorms and older students stay in apartments. It's hard to do justice to the people in my neighborhood, so let's skip to the stores and parks. Since my school is essentially its own self-contained neighborhood, it has plenty of stores and a single park. The stores offer a mix of dining options and the school's own brand of clothing and grocery stores, so you can find everything you need within the neighborhood. The park's a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, kept clean and safe thanks to everyone's efforts.",
            "I must say that after being here for about a decade, I've got some stories to share. I still remember the day I moved here to this neighborhood, I was really down, coming from Riverdale to Stockbridge. It was tough, I won't deny it, I missed them and the life we had there, but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sis, so we packed up and moved to a new place with better housing and a better high school. It was a big change, but over the years, I got used to it and made some new friends and, unfortunately, some new enemies at school too. One thing that's stuck with me is that I never really took the time to get to know my neighbors, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis, who we were lucky to have living next door. They've been like family to me, and I'm really grateful to have them. I remember when my family and I went to Mr. Glen's wedding; it was an amazing experience, and I'm hoping to have something similar one day when I'm older and settled. When Ms. Veda took off her wedding anklet and threw it, I was quick enough to catch it, but I wish I'd caught the flowers too! We danced the night away, and I had a blast with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I've lost touch with her since, but I hope she's doing great. The neighborhood can be confusing, but now that I have a GPS, it's easier to explore. I've only gone so far, mostly hanging out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We used to spend hours playing video games and living life to the fullest. I'd also head to the park to enjoy nature, which really calms me down and gives me a sense of peace. I'd bring sticks and practice my balance, and sometimes I'd bring my bokken sword if I could. It's great to do what I love. We also have a basketball and tennis court, even though I haven't played either sport in a while, it's good to have them around just in case I decide to pick them up again. My dad got me and my best friend into tennis with Mr. Graves, and we always had a blast, even though they pushed us hard. I'm sure there are plenty of more stories from my time here, but these are the things that really stand out, and who knows, the best is yet to come.",
            "The college that I attend is actually just nearby my place, which I must say I'm pretty fortunate about. I live in an apartment building, but there are a few restaurants and bars around that are pretty cool to hang out at, and they're not too pricey. I recently heard that one of the bars has been renamed, and it's a bit more expensive than the others, but the service and drinks aren't too bad. The people in the area are pretty nice, and since it's a college town, there are mostly students and low-income individuals living in the apartment buildings. You can also tell that there are a lot of families around, probably because there's an elementary school within walking distance from my apartment. I don't really know my neighbors, and to be honest, I don't particularly want to. They smoke a lot of weed, and our apartment management decided to put an air freshener unit right outside their door, which my boyfriend and I found pretty amusing. It's almost as if they're mocking us. The apartment buildings around me are mostly old-looking on the outside, but they might have been renovated inside. A bit further down the street, there are brand new apartments, but I don't really like them. I think the construction quality isn't that great, and the rent is super high, which I think is a bit unfair. Since they're close to the campus, the management of those buildings can get away with charging us exorbitant rent. There's this really cheap restaurant just a few minutes from my place that serves food on paper plates and most of it is microwaved. Across from that place is a gas station, which I've heard isn't a great place to work. However, thanks to some funding from the city, the road was renovated last summer, so now there's a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and the area looks a bit better. But my apartment building is actually pretty shaded, with lots of trees around it. They cut down a few of them, so there are a few stumps left behind, but there are still a lot of trees around my place compared to the other street. Behind my apartment complex is a row of trees, and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind it is 43rd street, and that one's not as nice. The sidewalks on that street are pretty bad and are falling apart, and most of the buildings look pretty run-down. There are a lot of trees on that street, but it's probably just to hide the state of the buildings. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but I don't think it's fair to blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But overall, I like living here. The rent is affordable, and there are plenty of useful amenities nearby, including the university, which is within walking distance, and there are two bus stops so I can easily get to the store and downtown.",
            "My current neighborhood is comprised of rows of duplex's in a cul-de-sac. They appear to be individual houses due to the intermittent placement and spacing, although they are painted the same, with yellow walls, white porches, and green metal roofs. Most of the residents are on friendly terms with one another, which adds to the communal atmosphere. Every evening, some of us stand at the end of our driveways and engage in casual conversations while the kids in the neighborhood play with their toys, create art with sidewalk chalk, or fly their kites. This setting is a refreshing escape from the monotony of the modern world, which is dominated by technology and computers. It's as if we're living in a bygone era. The surroundings are picturesque, with fields and trees accompanied by blue skies and puffy white clouds. However, this season has brought us tornado warnings, and for the first time, we actually heard the tornado sirens last night, prompting us to seek shelter. I, along with my little dog, found myself in the bathtub, clutching my purse and a few pillows. My larger dog, however, remained in the living room, whining and barking nervously due to the unusual circumstances. The neighborhood was eerily quiet, except for the sound of large hail pounding against the ground. After the storm passed, the road was steaming due to the dramatic temperature change, with the hail melting as soon as it hit the hot pavement. As I gazed up at the clearing skies, the sun broke through, and it began to rain. A double rainbow appeared, and I quickly ran inside to grab my camera to capture the moment. I shared the photos with my friends and family on Facebook, and they were just as amazed as I was. The streets remained quiet for another hour before people started returning home, and then it was back to normal – moms and kids outside, dinner being cooked. I've grown to adore this friendly neighborhood, especially the southern accent that's become music to my ears. Although all the houses appear identical on the outside, each apartment has its own unique layout and charm. Some are surprisingly small, which I find hard to understand. I enjoy taking leisurely walks through the largest field behind my home and strolling down to the pond, which isn't suitable for swimming. I've spotted deer, and in the mornings, you can hear the deep, resonant song of the bullfrog. It's a fantastic place to live, just a forty-minute drive away from the city of Charlotte. Each morning is a beautiful start, accompanied by the sounds of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It's as if we're living in a small, self-contained community. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that lets out a distinctive bray in the evenings, serving as a gentle reminder of his presence. I feel fortunate to have found this hidden gem of a neighborhood.",
            "It was my first day of eighth grade when I moved into this neighborhood. Making friends wasn't easy at first, but luckily I connected with two of my neighbors - one living two houses down and another on my street. Unfortunately, they've since moved away, but the memories still linger. To my surprise, most of the original residents who welcomed me when I first arrived are still here. Our neighborhood is pretty much your typical American suburban setup - rows of two-story houses and the usual sounds of kids playing outside on warm days. Weekends are usually pretty quiet, but when it's warm, you can hear the laughter of kids outside. I've been fortunate to have never had any issues with my neighbors, and it's clear that this is a community where you're left alone unless you genuinely need help. Online deliveries have become a norm, and I've ordered multiple times without ever having a package go missing from my porch. This speaks volumes about the trust my neighbors have in each other. A park just a minute or two away has been a hub for some of my fondest memories, including playing basketball, football, and baseball with my neighborhood friends. However, it's also where I suffered a painful injury when I got elbowed in the nose during a football game. The good memories far outweigh the bad, though. Nowadays, I visit the park to spend quality time with my cousin's younger kids, who still love playing on the swings and slides. Watching them brings back a mix of emotions, making me nostalgic for my past experiences there. The neighborhood is a melting pot of cultures, with an array of cuisines nearby. Just within a one-mile radius, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants, as well as plenty of fast-food shops and pizza places. Online food delivery services like GrubHub and DoorDash have become increasingly popular, though. The local stores cater to all our needs, with multiple dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store on the same street. There's even an Indian-owned store for those who crave homemade or ready-made Indian food. After seeing the unfortunate stories of neighborly conflicts on social media and news, I feel grateful to live in a neighborhood where I can trust my neighbors.",
            "My hometown is a charming little town in South Carolina that doesn't stand out from the rest, but it's a significant contributor to the agriculture sector. Johnston claims to be the Peach Capital of the World, a title proudly displayed on the town's welcoming sign. Its main landscape consists of farmland where peach trees and cattle dominate the scene. Houses, mostly two-story affairs with metal or gray roofs to combat the scorching summer heat, are scattered throughout the outskirts of town. They're often set back from the road, allowing the front fields to be used for grazing animals and crops. The central part of town features a single stoplight at an intersection, where the few shops are located. A small Chinese restaurant called Hong Kong, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a local burger chain, offer limited dining options. A former pizzeria has since closed down. There's a small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug, famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola. A tiny grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, is the town's sole grocery store, but many residents prefer to shop at the nearby Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville. However, the most bustling spot in town is Dollar General, which sells a vast array of everyday items and is always crowded from opening to closing. A small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind-hearted woman, has been a staple in Johnston for years and even employs delivery services. Adjacent to the furniture store is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet groomer offering various services. Both a doctor's office and a veterinary clinic are located outside the main town area, providing essential services to the residents. The town has a single elementary school, Johnston Elementary School, but students attend middle and high school in the next town over after completing the fifth grade. Although there aren't many recreational activities, the town is working on creating a 2.5-acre recreational area to attract visitors and potential residents. While it's a quiet town with limited amenities, it's still a pleasant place to live, so small that you could easily miss it in the blink of an eye.",
            "The first time I heard about my neighborhood, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It caught me off guard. Almost every apartment in the area was renting for over a thousand dollars a month, but I'd never heard anything about this story. Neither had my friends. It's like the darkness that settles in when you're struggling. I know some of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night due to financial struggles. We've learned to be thrifty over the years, but it's funny how you start to appreciate the smell of second-hand items and old clothes. You even start to enjoy the smell of stale air. As an adult, you might start smoking or just get used to the way things are. But the thrift stores in my area never fail to remind me of this reality. There are three within walking distance, and if you start from the far end, you'll find charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. The townscape may be chaotic, with cars and people packed into the streets every morning, but the thrift stores are always quiet. It's the perfect place to lose an afternoon. Every year, the city grows more crowded with cars and people. It's a developing city, they say, and it's home to one of the largest e-commerce empires. It reminds me of New York, where everyone's focused on their goals and nobody bothers you. You can keep to yourself, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where people seem to pry into your life. In this city, you can keep your shell intact, and the city will just roll on like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be, with the pianist next door and the amateur vocalists upstairs always creating something new. We don't live in a typical apartment of strangers; instead, we're a community of friends who come together for birthdays, funerals, and when we need help. I'm lucky to be here, and I really like most of my neighbors. We look out for each other, clean up after ourselves, and share food and mail. It's nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. Despite living in a massive modernist sprawl, my neighbors make me feel like I haven't completely messed up my life.",
            "I live in a typical suburban area, nothing out of the ordinary. My neighborhood is like a cookie cutter version of suburban living. Everywhere you look, you'll see well-maintained single family homes, thanks to our homeowner's association. The front yards all share a similar theme: a small patch of neatly cut grass, some decorative pebbles, and short driveways. You'll also spot small trees scattered here and there. Every house has two-car garages. As you drive through the neighborhood, you'll notice newly paved concrete roads in excellent condition – no potholes or bumps in sight. Most of the homes are one-story, but some have two stories as well. What sets our neighborhood apart is the mail system. Instead of individual mailboxes in front of each house, we have a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street that require a key to access. We also have two big package lockers, courtesy of our HOA's love for uniformity. Our neighborhood is on the outskirts of the nearby city, so it's a mix of rural and suburban living. We have plenty of open land and a range of amenities, including multiple community pools that are well-maintained and gated. There are also walking trails where you can take your dog for a walk or go for a solo evening stroll. Exercise isn't a problem here – you can simply run around the neighborhood and get your daily dose of exercise. Our community is predominantly made up of retirees, but we also have a mix of middle-aged and young professionals. The city itself is surprisingly large, with a small-town feel. We have all the amenities you'd expect, including a single mall that may not be huge, but gets the job done. It takes me about 15 minutes to drive to anywhere significant, but once I get there, I have access to a variety of stores, from high-end grocery stores to bargain outlets. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty standard – we have our nice touches like pools and walking trails, and while we're not right next door to any shopping centers, it's an easy drive to get to any major chain store I want.",
            "I reside in a small Midwestern town situated just outside the suburban outskirts of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, located on the east side, is considered the most economically disadvantaged area within the town. Property values are on the lower side, with most houses rented or owned by low-income individuals, yet it's far from unattractive or unpleasant. The people in my neighborhood are generally friendly and always greet me with a smile when I walk down the street. Crime rates are slightly higher than in other parts of town, but still relatively low. In the past decade, a few violent crimes have occurred close to my home, including shootings and a homicide. Our next-door neighbors recently lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar. Fortunately, my family hasn't been directly affected by crime, except for occasionally losing items from our porch when we forget to bring them inside. Our town has been greatly impacted by the \"opioid epidemic\" affecting many parts of the United States. Unfortunately, many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are numerous resources available to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those struggling with addiction. Despite the challenges, my town has many positive qualities. My son's elementary school has an excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. He has special needs, yet he hasn't faced any bullying due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he truly loves attending. We have an active PTO that organizes multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Given that over 20% of our town's population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child ever goes hungry. No child or family is treated as less than due to financial constraints, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are reasonable. The City Council and staff have implemented various improvements to our town's appearance, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the town center and on the west side, where shopping areas are located and most traffic passes through. In contrast, the east side, where I live, tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for my neighbors and me. Despite these issues, I genuinely enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are excellent, there are sufficient shopping options to meet my family's needs, and while our home may not be worth much, it is comfortable and suitable. We've lived here for over 16 years, and it's hard to imagine calling anywhere else home.",
            "My neighborhood is a vibrant cultural hub, nestled on a hill surrounded by buildings steeped in history. I live in a 7-story apartment building right opposite the old theater, and just down the road, you'll find a trendy arcade bar that draws in a diverse crowd on warm summer evenings. The line of people waiting to get in is a common sight, especially during weekends in June and July. A short walk up is the city park, a decent size considering its location. The park is encircled by concrete, with steep stairs carved into the wall. During the harsh winter months, you'll see homeless people setting up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and wide steps. Although it doesn't snow often, the heavy rainfall in mid-winter can be challenging to cope with. By setting their tents close together in the city center, they stay relatively warmer. They're also close to the local family center, where they can access basic necessities like showers and baths. What I love about my city isn't its historic architecture or the hills that roll down to the ocean. It's the people themselves who make my neighborhood so special. You see, Hilltop was once notorious for gang violence on the West Coast, and stories of federal officials and the DEA sweeping through the area still circulate today. The community still remembers those days. Despite being considered one of the rougher neighborhoods in the city, the people work hard to keep it clean and safe. They still care about what happens in their area, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill at night, but I think this warning is a relic of the past, tainted with social conditioning. Perhaps it's because I blend in as a 'not-so-white' person, or maybe the Hilltop community recognizes me as one of their own, someone who's just as aware of the reminders that plague our nation. These reminders are a result of racism, cultural conditioning, and ignorance-fueled assumptions, even in a city that prides itself as a cultural melting pot. I know one thing: no matter where life takes me, Hilltop will always be home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who've shown me kindness and compassion, even when I needed it most. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open late to charge my phone when I was stranded in the rain. It's a place where I've sat, feeling invisible, huddled against a concrete storefront on a bleak night, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I reside in Rural America, a small town in Michigan. The landscape here is a beautiful mix of farmland and quaint tourist cities. We don't have the big city luxuries like malls, chain stores like Wal-mart or Target, or even a fancy restaurant like Applebee's. Everything you need is within driving distance. Despite this, our little town is surrounded by breathtaking natural beauty - the stunning waters of Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Every corner of our \"city\" offers access to a beach where you can dip your toes in the water. Our neighborhood perfectly embodies the essence of small-town life. Houses are spread out, not towering on top of each other like in big cities. They're a mix of old and new, with some homes dating back years and others beautifully renovated. Most houses have full basements that are visible from the road, giving them a charming, down-to-earth feel. The neighborhood is a kaleidoscope of colors, with houses painted in every hue imaginable. Yards are a common feature, with trampolines, playsets, and even gardens and fences for pets. The atmosphere is quintessentially Middle American - hardworking folks striving to make a living, some raising families and others having already done so. On any given day, you'll see kids running up and down the streets, people walking their dogs, biking, or rollerblading. Neighbors know and look out for one another, and you can quickly tell who's part of the community and who's an outsider. You'll see people grilling in their front yards, waving at passersby, or walking their dogs and exchanging pleasantries with neighbors a few blocks away. Lawns are well-maintained, with neatly trimmed grass and tidy gardens. It's not a neighborhood that will leave you awestruck, but one that exudes a sense of comfort and security. It's a quiet, peaceful place where you can feel safe, and that's exactly what people want in life. Within walking distance, you'll find the county sheriff's department, the health department, and the recycling center, which serves the entire city. We have baseball and softball fields nearby, where you can hear the announcers calling out the names of players and keeping score. The small town airport is just a stone's throw away, and you can often hear the sound of small planes taking off and landing. You can also walk to the local ice cream shop or head downtown from our neighborhood. My kids can ride their bikes to the nearby park, which is just an 8-block ride away. It's a wonderful place to call home."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "Lately, I've been living in a bustling city, where the streets are filled with people from all walks of life. My neighborhood is a melting pot, with residential areas scattered among commercial ones. You can find everything from offices to restaurants, stores, and entertainment spots. There are countless new restaurants to try and shops to browse, ranging from big, well-known brands to small, trendy boutiques. These boutiques not only line the malls but also occupy the streets, which are just a short walk from quiet neighborhoods that would otherwise be peaceful. I've noticed that people often visit the nearby parks with their kids, enjoying the fresh air and greenery. The diversity in my neighborhood is quite impressive, with a thriving LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a group of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union all living in the same area. Further afield, there are even more people from different racial and cultural backgrounds, though they often stick together in their own little communities within the city. We have areas like Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia, just a few miles away, but the traffic makes it a pain to get there. Rush hour is especially bad, and it takes a long time to drive short distances. People don't usually walk much in my city, given its size, so the traffic is atrocious, and parking spots are hard to come by. Despite all this, the city is seeing a lot of new construction, with massive apartment buildings going up left and right. While it's great for some, many residents are worried about the added crowds and traffic. My city has a wide range of houses, from single-family homes to apartment buildings and condominiums. It's not all about high-rise apartments; some people prefer to live in smaller, more intimate settings. Even in my own neighborhood, I see a mix of different housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of all ages, and I'm not really familiar with most of my neighbors. It's not the kind of close-knit community it used to be, but I do have fond memories of playing with my next-door neighbor and a few friends from back in the day.",
            "You know, my neighborhood's got a lot of character. Most of the houses are single-family homes, but there are a few that have been split into two, still connected in some way. My place has a tiny front yard and a small driveway to the left, pretty typical of the others. It's like stepping back in time, you know? People used to think that living in the suburbs was the ultimate dream, but now it's not as appealing as it used to be. Yet, my neighborhood's still here, still holding onto that dream, and it's like it's calling out to us, reminding us that it's still alive. The people around here aren't as optimistic as they used to be, the yards aren't as well-maintained as they once were, but you still see a car or two in every driveway, and the kids are still playing like the world revolves around them. The old public school that's been here for almost 90 years is still standing, still giving the kids hope for the future, and it's like a blast from the past for the older folks. There aren't many churches around, and they're mostly empty, but the basketball courts are always packed. All the houses may look different, but they feel the same. There's this huge supermarket called \"Super A\" owned by a large Yemeni family, who are probably the only Arab family in the area. Most of the residents are African American. The streets are wide, and the kids play football, only stopping when cars come by. Most of the people around here have been here for generations, and they've got stories to tell about a time when everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school, but when the karate movie craze died down, the kids lost interest, so now it's a pharmacy. People say that with drugs, everything's better, or so they say. There's also this small movie theater that shows old movies at a discount, kind of a hidden gem, but the kids aren't interested because it's not hip enough, while the older folks think it's a bargain for a night out without the kids, of course. We've got this single expressway that runs through our town, but the entrance and exit are actually in the next town over. There was this petition to get an exit in our town, but it got shot down. The youth wanted it, while the older folks were against it, saying it'd ruin the town. Now, they're building a new high school, and we're trying to decide on a mascot for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the perfect representation of our town.",
            "You might overlook it at first glance, but look closer and you'll discover a whole other world behind the rows of shops and hotels. It's not exactly the kind of place you'd expect to find a community, let alone one that's thriving. But if you venture behind the old Whole Foods, which has long been abandoned, and walk down the road behind the hotels that are only occupied for a short time each summer, you'll stumble upon a bustling neighborhood. Amidst this community are several apartment complexes, situated side by side like a string of carefully placed Russian nesting dolls. The first complex you'll come across has had its fair share of controversy, so we'll skip over that. However, the ones nearby are a different story altogether - a world that remains a secret to most people living in this area.\n\nAcross from these complexes stands a community college's satellite campus, a quiet, sleepy group of buildings that seem to stand guard over the road. Students shuffle in with their coffee, yawning at 7 in the morning as they start their day. The iron gates creak open to let them in one by one, while commuters in their cars shake their fists at the traffic congestion caused by the increased attendance on certain days. The road forks into another residential street, lined with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center on the other, where people recover from unfortunate accidents. The treatment center boasts cheerful outdoor furniture and a lazily spinning ceiling fan that circulates the warm summer air. Children run around in the park, playing tag and cartwheeling in the grass, while bees lazily flit between the flowers by the road. You'll see retirees walking their dogs, scowling at the skateboarders and nodding politely at the teenage girls gossiping by the playground equipment. There's a sushi place in a nearby strip mall with affordable food but always seems to be quiet, alongside a swimming supply store and a nail salon in between. You can fill up your pool for the season while getting a manicure and enjoying some hibachi chicken - the convenience of a strip mall. There's also a frozen yogurt shop where you can add your own toppings, and you often see teenagers in the park clutching cold, sweaty cups of frozen yogurt as they skateboard and vape. This neighborhood is a quintessential slice of Americana, a piece of history in the quiet south where time seems to stand still, unchanged.",
            "As we cruised past the seemingly endless corn fields that stretched as far as the eye could see, she asked, \"Where are we?\" I just smiled knowingly, anticipating the look of shock on her face as she took in the vastness of the open landscape. Coming from a town where the nearby grocery store was just a short 5-minute walk from her front door, she'd never experienced anything like this before. The sheer vastness of the corn fields left her speechless, and I took the opportunity to share with her what it was like growing up in rural Ohio. In that moment, she finally grasped who I was and where I came from.\n\nA two-lane country road led us to a quarry filled with water, followed by the small development where I reside. The houses here are a mix of brick and stucco, each with at least half an acre of land that everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, the area is a kaleidoscope of colors, thanks to the annual flowers and midwestern trees that change with the seasons. You'll also notice the driveways lined with sleek, high-end Mercedes-Benz luxury cars that glisten in the sun after a refreshing wash. As we continued down the road, my neighbor, a friendly Korean man, was out mowing his lawn, singing along to the hum of his John Deere Zero Turn mower. His daily routine brings a smile to everyone's face, and it's not just his cheerful demeanor that makes him special – he's also got a fascinating story to tell.\n\nAs we approached my home, you'd notice the abundance of geese in the side yard, chased by our energetic Terrier. The sound of the nearby stream, bullfrogs, and the occasional moo from the nearby farms created a soothing background melody. Across the handmade wooden bridge lay an untouched oasis, teeming with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was where I spent most of my childhood, building tree forts, 'hunting' animals (which mostly involved chasing them), and making lifelong friends with the other neighborhood kids. Winters in my small town could be harsh, but there was something magical about the transformation. The once lush green yard would turn into an empty wilderness, with bare trees and the occasional snowfall turning it into a winter wonderland overnight. My little sister and I would spend hours making snow angels, building snowmen, and engaging in epic snowball fights. We'd construct massive igloo-like forts, armed with branches, to house our arsenal of snowballs. In that winter wonderland, we were carefree kids, with nothing but the joy of childhood to worry about.",
            "The starting point for any visitor to Portland, Oregon, is to understand what it means to be \"weird\". A sign on the back of a building that serves as a multifaceted hub - a pizza joint, bar, music venue, and more - proudly displays the town's unofficial slogan: \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this phrase is a nostalgic reminder of the city's past, a time when it was less well-known and less expensive, fostering a unique cultural landscape. To others, it's an invitation to come and experience a place where being considered \"weird\" is a badge of honour. Despite an influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of new condominiums, Portland remains an unconventional city. \"Weird\" does not imply a complete rejection of modernity, but rather a willingness to accept the unconventional and the unusual. Like many cities, we consume many of our goods from China. However, Portland has its own brand of normalcy, with yoga enthusiasts, hipsters, and business professionals coexisting with a more eclectic crowd. Perhaps what makes Portland unique is its carefree attitude towards these contrasts. In my own neighbourhood, as with many in Portland, you'll find vibrant houses, lush home gardens, and in the summertime, free boxes lining the streets. Free boxes can contain anything - clothes, books, or even household items - and they're a treasure trove waiting to be discovered. The magic of stumbling upon a hidden gem in a Southeast Portland neighbourhood is what makes this city so special. To me, that's what Portland is all about, but I'm just one of many individuals who call this city home. Some of my neighbours would never dream of rummaging through a free box for second-hand items. Instead, they might attend goat yoga or a Portland Timbers match. What's remarkable about this city is the diversity of interests and passions that its residents possess. We're a city of dreamers, both those who are actively pursuing their passions and those who are still daydreaming about them, often over a drink at a local bar. Of course, like many cities, Portland struggles with substance abuse issues, which often stem from deeper mental health problems. The city's signature grey skies and constant rain may also contribute to this issue. Additionally, Portland faces a homelessness crisis, which is a challenge that many cities grapple with. While we offer better social services than some other parts of the country, they're still insufficient. The general public is torn between sympathy and frustration towards the homeless population. In this regard, Portland is not so weird after all.",
            "The mountains have always stood tall, a constant presence in the north, silently witnessing the dawn and dusk of each day. Unfazed by the turmoil of life, their steadfastness is a comforting reminder, especially when I'm consumed by stress and anxiety. It's as if they beckon me to come closer, offering a respite for my weary soul. I first laid eyes on them when I started my undergrad, and they've held a special place in my heart ever since. While the university has its own share of breathtaking spots, the mountains are the true crown jewel. The rest of the town has its own charm, with quaint cafes and old buildings that exude an air of history. Yet, it's the mountains that draw me in, their rugged grandeur a stark contrast to the bustling downtown area. The town's duality is a fascinating aspect - from the vibrant high street to the serene library, each area has its unique character. It's this contrast that makes the town so captivating, as if it's inviting me to explore and create memories. Whether it's strolling through the park with friends or racing through the downtown streets to catch the latest movie, every part of town holds a special place in my heart. However, it's also a place where painful memories reside, much like anywhere else in life. The ponds, in particular, have been a sanctuary for me, a place to reflect and cry during the darkest moments. As I watched the turtles and ducks living their lives, I couldn't help but ponder my own purpose and the mysteries of life. I'd walk past the pond, the park, and the houses, until I reached the main street, where the sun would paint the sky with its vibrant hues. And as I looked up at the sunrise, I'd realize I was walking north, drawn to the mountains that stood tall, a constant reminder of my determination.",
            "If you're planning a trip to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, don't worry - you'll have no issue finding it. The area is well-connected to public transportation, which is one of the most popular ways to get around New York City. Bensonhurst itself is an urban neighborhood, offering the hustle and bustle of the city. When exploring, you'll notice a plethora of Asian stores scattered throughout the area. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurst has seen a significant influx of Asian residents, resulting in an abundance of Asian-owned businesses - at least one per block. You'll likely find yourself surrounded by Asian-owned supermarkets and laundromats. These businesses are extremely popular among locals, offering top-notch food, affordable prices, and unparalleled convenience. I'm lucky enough to be close to four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walking distance from each other. This convenience makes accessing grocery shopping a breeze. While Bensonhurst isn't exclusively occupied by Asian residents, the area is culturally diverse, with immigrants and their children from various generations calling it home.\n\nMajority-owned businesses in the area are Asian-owned, but you'll also find a beautifully renovated park nearby, boasting over ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy in the summer. As you're in the heart of New York City, expect to see an array of diversity in the park, with people from all walks of life getting along harmoniously. Unlike other areas in the city, Bensonhurst doesn't have large corporate buildings; instead, you'll find co-op living spaces and condominium apartments. The majority of the living spaces are two-family houses. The locals are generally nice but can be a bit rowdy. Be prepared for loud cars blasting music as you walk by or people flooring their gas in the morning, which might wake you up. If you're planning a nighttime visit, be cautious - the neighborhood is generally safe, but you might encounter people looking for trouble or bullies. I've personally experienced bullying in the past, but it was a long time ago. More recently, there have been incidents of package theft. While it's a common issue elsewhere, package thieves do exist in Bensonhurst. One of my pet peeves is the lack of cleanliness in the neighborhood - specifically, dog waste everywhere. Be mindful of your surroundings, especially in the mornings, and keep your shoes clean!",
            "I live in a place with very limited sidewalks. Our house sits at the top of a steep hill in the neighborhood, which makes it a great spot for joggers to get a good workout. They often refer to it as the \"workout hill.\" Since there are no sidewalks on my street, everyone has to walk on the road, which can be a bit hazardous due to potholes and uneven surfaces. The telephone and electric wires surrounding my neighborhood are often in disrepair, with tattered-looking cables and patchwork repairs from frequent storm damage. We get a lot of rain and storms here, which causes branches and debris to fall on the power lines. \n\nThe area is surrounded by tall evergreen trees, but people around here aren't fans of them. They try to cut them down as much as possible because they block the view of the ocean. As a result, many houses are built high up on the hill with large glass windows to take in the view of the bay. It's beautiful during sunset when the water below is lit up and the sky turns orange. However, most days are overcast and cloudy, making it hard to see the sunlight clearly. Moss grows everywhere, from roofs to cars to railings, due to the constant dampness. I once left my car outside for a month, and when I returned, it was covered in moss and took me hours to clean off. The neighborhood is mostly made up of older residents, with many retirees. We don't have many kids around, but there's a school not far away. Instead of kids, we have a lot of dogs running around. They often sit in front of houses or chase each other down the street. If you leave a door or window open, they might sneak in. I once found one in my living room and had to shoo it out. Rabbits are also common in our area, and they can cause problems for gardeners by digging up plant roots and burrowing into lawns. However, my cats love them and have managed to hunt most of them out of our neighborhood. We also have a variety of birds, including small sparrows, hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle that gets chased off by the neighborhood crows. If you're willing to hike down to the waterfront, there are some restaurants that serve fresh seafood, but the beach itself is small and not very wide. You can still see the opposite shoreline clearly even on misty days.",
            "I live in a typical suburban area in a small town in the southern part of Tennessee. Our street is a connecting route between two state highways, resulting in a moderate amount of traffic, which I don't always enjoy. However, the neighborhood remains relatively quiet, with not too many people moving in and out. I've grown accustomed to the familiar faces that live around here. Most residents spend their days tending to their yards and other daily tasks. In the winter, we enjoy sledding down a nearby hill on our street. Our house, located at the corner of our street, allows us to see everyone passing by and become familiar with the vehicles that frequent our area. Whenever a stranger's car passes by, we tend to take notice. Some of our neighbors go for walks or take their dogs out for exercise. Kids can often be seen riding their bikes and engaging in typical neighborhood activities. Since we work from home, we're often at home, along with my wife and our two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen. As a result, everyone is used to seeing us come and go. We enjoy spending time outside, even on rainy days. Occasionally, we fire up the grill on our back deck, and the delicious smell of barbecue fills the air. The sounds of lawn mowers are a regular occurrence from March to October, when the grass growth slows down. Our neighborhood was originally a wooded area, so we have plenty of trees providing shade, but also a lot of leaves in the fall, which means raking and burning them every year. I enjoy the smell of burning leaves, marking the arrival of fall. Lately, we've been experiencing mild winters, making it feel like an extended fall season. Our garage is located at the back of our house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone knocks, which is a rare occurrence. I like tinkering with my truck or other projects in the garage, and when the doors are open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, the neighborhood is relatively quiet, with some families visiting from out of town during special occasions like Thanksgiving and Christmas. If it weren't a through street, I think our neighborhood would be perfect.",
            "I live in a neighborhood that's smack in the middle of the high desert, where the landscape is dominated by dirt and dust. Unless you've experienced living here, it's hard to grasp the feeling of seeing nothing but brown everywhere you look. It's not until you spot a lawn that you realize the owner must be breaking the bank to keep it looking that way. When I first moved here in the 90s, houses were spread out, but nowadays, it's pretty much the same, with some new additions popping up. The area is slowly transforming into a city, but I suppose that's a trend we see everywhere. On the plus side, the people here are generally friendly, though, just like any city, we have our good and bad sides. I'm surrounded by friendly, older folks, which makes it a nice neighborhood. The shopping scene is pretty basic, with just the usual chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you're looking for something upscale, you'll have to drive a bit. You won't find any Whole Foods or similar stores around here. The main industries in my city seem to be construction, which makes sense, given how undeveloped the area still is, with plenty of open spaces left to build on. That's a bit unsettling, but after living in a big city, I'm not eager to go back. My job is actually in the construction industry – I work as a drywall and T-bar installer. One thing I appreciate about my home is the diverse wildlife. People come to the high desert for its natural beauty, and it's home to unique ecosystems that need protecting. It's essential for human residents to learn about the non-human inhabitants of our environment to live in harmony. My family and I have adapted well to the local wildlife. My three kids are obsessed with lizards and desert bugs, and as I write this, they're outside trying to catch different specimens. As for attractions, we have a few. Victorville is a great place for families to experience the desert, and if you can, plan your visit to coincide with the annual San Bernardino County Fair. The fair offers a great mix of activities and fun in the Victorville style. If you head to nearby Wrightwood, you can see the snow-covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to cap off your visit. If you're interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem, the Victor Valley Museum is a great place to start. It features geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of Victorville's development and industry.",
            "When someone asks me to describe my neighbourhood, I'm pretty sure my answer would be quite unique. Unlike others who might be homeowners with their own life, my situation is a bit different. My neighbourhood is where I'm studying, and the people living in my dorm are like my community. The surrounding campus is part of my neighbourhood as well, but to a lesser extent. Although my neighbourhood is a bit unconventional, it shares some qualities with the typical idea of a neighbourhood. For instance, it has houses, people, shops and parks, just like any normal neighbourhood. Let's start with the \"houses\" that make up my neighbourhood. Before I dive into that, I should clarify the types of houses you can find around here. There are three types: apartments, houses, and dormitory houses. Firstly, the apartments usually have 2-4 people in each room, and there are 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type has about 2 floors, so there are around 20 people living in each building. Next, there are the houses that are available for rent, usually with 2-4 bedrooms. They're mostly occupied by alumni, but there aren't many of them around. Finally, there are the dorm rooms, where you'll find hundreds of students sharing rooms with one other person, except for a few exceptions. It's the most common type of housing in my neighbourhood. Now that we've covered the houses, let's talk about the people. My school values diversity, and it's reflected in my neighbourhood. People from all walks of life and different ages live here. The professional staff live in the houses, while the new students stay in the dorms and the older students in the apartments. Since my school is essentially a self-contained neighbourhood, it has plenty of shops and a single park. The shops offer a mix of food options and the school's own brands of clothing and groceries, so you can get anything you need without leaving. The park is a playground for everyone in the neighbourhood, kept clean and safe by all of us who live here.",
            "Well, after 10 years of living here, I think I can share my experiences with you. When I first moved to this neighborhood, I was pretty sad. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge with my family, and I have to admit, I cried because I missed my old home and friends. But my parents wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for a house, a better high school, and a more comfortable life. As time went by, I started to get used to the new place and made some new friends, but also encountered some not-so-friendly people in school. I didn't really get to know my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his family, and Dennis, who lived right next to us. They're wonderful people whom I consider as a kind of family, and I appreciate them greatly.\n\nI still remember when we went to Mr. Glen's wedding. It was a fun and memorable day, and I'm looking forward to experiencing something similar in the future when I settle down and give my future partner the life they deserve. When Mr. Glen's wife, Ms. Veda, removed her white strap and threw it, I managed to catch it, but unfortunately, I missed catching the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I enjoyed spending time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven't seen her since, but I hope she's doing well and pursuing her dreams.\n\nLiving in this neighborhood can be a bit confusing at times, but with the help of GPS, I've been able to explore it more. I've only ventured out with my friends Kason and Curtis so far, and we used to spend hours playing video games and enjoying life to the fullest. Sometimes I'd visit the park to connect with nature and find some peace. It's amazing how it can calm my mind and soothe my soul. I'd also bring sticks I bought from Home Depot and practice my balance, and sometimes I'd take my wooden sword, the bokken, with me. I love doing what I love and having fun.\n\nWe also have a basketball and tennis court in the neighborhood, although I haven't played tennis or basketball in a while. It's nice to have them available if I ever want to pick up the sport again. My dad taught me and my best friend to play tennis with Mr. Graves, and we always had a great time, even though they made us work hard. But that's what made it so enjoyable. I've had many wonderful experiences in this neighborhood, and there are more stories to share, but these are the ones that stand out to me, and I'm excited to see what the future holds.",
            "My place is literally just a stone's throw away from my college, which is why I'm so fond of living here. I have the luxury of living amidst apartment buildings, some cheap eateries, and a few bars that are fun to hang out at without burning a hole in my pocket. One of the bars just got a new name, and it's a bit pricier, but the quality of service and drinks are decent, and the people there are quite friendly. They're either students or low-income residents, considering the affordable apartment prices. There's a bunch of kids around since the nearby elementary school is within walking distance, but I don't really know my neighbors. They smoke a lot of weed, and the management of my building installed an air freshener right in front of their door, which my boyfriend and I found hilarious - it's almost like they're being mocked. The buildings around me are a bit old-looking, but maybe they've got renovated insides. A bit down the street, there are brand new apartments that look fancy, but I'm not a fan of them. They claim to be high-end but I'm pretty sure they're cheaply built, and the rent is way too steep. I think it's just a rip-off, but I guess since they're close to campus, the management can get away with it. There's a super cheap restaurant just about five minutes from my place that serves paper plates with mostly microwaved food. I also have a gas station right across from it, which, I've heard, isn't a great place to work. However, thanks to some city funds, the road was renovated last summer, and now we have a nice wide sidewalk, decent grass, and a more pleasant atmosphere. My apartment building is pretty shaded with trees, but the management cut a few down, leaving stumps behind. There are way more trees where I live compared to the other side of the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line, and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but just behind it is 43rd street, which isn't as nice. The sidewalks are all crumbled, and the buildings look shabby. There are a lot of trees there too, but I think they're just to hide the state of the buildings. Most of the crime in my area happens at an apartment complex on that street, but I'm not gonna blame just them - it's a problem that affects the whole area. There are apartments across the street from me that have their own share of crime and a rather transient population. Still, I like where I live. It's affordable, and there are plenty of useful amenities nearby, including the university and two bus stops that make it easy for me to get to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighbourhood is a quiet haven, composed of double-storey houses on a cul-de-sac. The homes are spaced out, giving the illusion of being individual houses. However, they all share the same distinct features - a vibrant yellow exterior, crisp white porches, and emerald green metal roofs. While most residents are friendly with one another, not everyone is acquaintances. We often gather at the end of a winding driveway in the evenings, engaging in casual conversations as the neighbourhood kids play with their toys, colour with sidewalk chalk, or fly their kites. It's a refreshing respite from the fast-paced, tech-obsessed world we live in, reminiscent of a bygone era. The scenery is picturesque - rolling fields, towering trees, and a brilliant blue sky dotted with puffy white clouds. Yet, Mother Nature can be unpredictable. This season, we've been plagued by tornado warnings, and for the first time, we heard the eerie sound of actual tornado sirens last night, prompting us to seek shelter. I found myself taking refuge in my bathtub, clutching my smallest dog and essentials, while my bigger dog remained in the living room, anxious and barking. The neighbourhood was eerily quiet, except for the deafening sound of large hail pounding the ground. As the storm passed, the temperature plummeted from 92 to 75 degrees in a matter of minutes. The hail instantly melted upon hitting the scorching pavement. As the skies cleared, the sun peeked through, and a double rainbow appeared. I quickly grabbed my camera to capture the breathtaking scene, eager to share it with my friends and family on Facebook. They, like me, were amazed by the spectacle. The streets remained deserted for another hour before people began returning home from wherever they were when the storm struck. Once again, life returned to normal - dinner was cooking, and mothers and children were outside enjoying the evening. As a transplant from New Hampshire to North Carolina, I've grown fond of the region's distinct southern drawl. My two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment, like everyone else's, may look identical from the outside, but each has its unique character inside. Some are surprisingly compact, leaving me perplexed. I cherish strolling through the expansive field behind my home, making my way to the pond, which, unfortunately, isn't suitable for swimming. I've spotted deer and, in the mornings, I'm serenaded by the deep, melodic song of the giant bullfrog. It's a fantastic place to call home, situated just 40 minutes from the bustling city of Charlotte. Each morning begins with the cheerful sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms, giving our neighbourhood a village-like atmosphere. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that brays in the evening, letting us know he's still there. I feel fortunate to have discovered this hidden gem of a neighbourhood.",
            "It was during my 8th grade year when I moved into this neighbourhood. It took me a while to make friends, but I eventually became close with two guys, one who lives just two houses down and another on the same street. Although neither of them lives here anymore, the memories we made together still linger. The people who were here when I first arrived are still here, for the most part. My neighbourhood is pretty much like any other American suburb. There are plenty of two-storey houses, and on warm days, I can hear the kids playing outside every weekend. Most days are quiet, but you're never left on your own unless you need help. I've ordered several packages online without any issues, and my neighbours are trustworthy. Just a minute or two away from my house is a park where I've spent many happy times. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there with my friends, and it's also where I got one of my worst injuries - a nasty elbow to the nose while playing football. However, the good memories far outweigh the bad. These days, I visit the park with my cousin's kids. They're still young and love playing on the swings and slides. The thought of going to the park always brings back a flood of memories. The neighbourhood is quite diverse, and you can find all sorts of food nearby. Within a one-mile radius, there are Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants, although many people now prefer ordering food through apps like GrubHub and DoorDash. The most popular places are fast food shops, but you can find those just about anywhere. There are also many pizza places. The stores here have everything you could ever need, including multiple dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is a staple in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even run by Indians, catering to those who want to cook homemade Indian food or buy ready-made dishes. All in all, I'm a big fan of my neighbourhood. Seeing the horror stories on social media and news about people's experiences with their neighbours makes me grateful for the ones I have.",
            "My hometown of Johnston is a charming little place that doesn't stand out from the rest of the towns in South Carolina, but it holds a significant influence in the agricultural sector. It proudly claims to be the Peach Capital of the World, a title showcased on the welcoming sign at the town's entrance. The landscape is mainly dominated by vast farmlands of either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't situated in the town center are spaced out, with most being two-story homes featuring metal roofs to combat the scorching summer heat or gray shingles. These homes are often situated away from the main road, allowing for the front fields to be used for farming. In the town center, there's only one traffic light at a four-way intersection. It's here that you'll find the town's few stores. There are three options for quick bites: Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. A pizzeria used to be in operation, but it closed down a while ago. Maxwell and Halford Drug is a small family-owned pharmacy that's surprisingly famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola. Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA for short, is a small and pricey grocery store that's the town's only option. While it's the main grocery store, many residents prefer to travel to the Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville to buy most of their groceries. The most popular store in town, though, is Dollar General, which sells a wide variety of everyday essentials and is always bustling from opening to closing. There's also a small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind community figure who employs two movers to deliver purchased items. Right next door is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a small pet grooming service that offers various services like daycare, boarding, grooming, and more. Both the doctor's office and veterinary clinic are located outside the town center, but they're well-equipped to serve the town's residents. We have a single elementary school, Johnston Elementary School, which serves students up to fifth grade. After that, students move on to middle and high school in the neighboring town. Although there aren't any parks within the town, a new 2.5-acre recreational area is currently under construction to provide families with more opportunities for outings and attract new visitors or residents. Despite its limited attractions, Johnston is a nice place that's so small you could drive right by without even noticing it.",
            "The first time I heard about my place, it was while listening to a podcast about people who went missing. It left a surprising impression on me. Almost every apartment in the area was renting for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story before, and my friends hadn't either. It made me think about the struggles we all face. I know some of my friends struggle to sleep at night because of the costs. Things are expensive, but over time, we've learned to be thrifty. You start to accept the dusty smell of flea market items and worn-out clothes. You notice you smell less in adulthood. You might start smoking or become accustomed to the way things are. However, the flea market always manages to assert itself. The smell of adulthood is the musty smell of old magazines on an old piano, which even washing the piano can't remove. Here, there're three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can visit two charity stores, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curio shop. Downtown is crowded, with cars and people filling the streets every morning, but inside the thrift stores, you'll find silence. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store remains quiet. It's a nice place to spend an afternoon. Every year, the area gets busier, with more cars and people flooding the streets. It's a developing city, they say. As one of the largest e-commerce and delivery empires is headquartered here, it's still dealing with growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone's focused on their goals, and nobody really asks for much. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's different from the South, where showing a little concern means you care. You don't pry into people's lives here; you can keep your shell as long as you like, and the city will move along like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. There's always something going on, whether it's the pianist next door or the two amateur singers upstairs. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. I feel fortunate to live here. I quite like my neighbors, and they treat me well. I try to keep my apartment clean and leave food for them, and they do the same for me. I bring their mail, and they bring mine. It's nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my presence just as much as I do theirs. Despite living in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl, it's my neighbors who make me feel like I haven't ruined my life completely.",
            "My neighborhood is a pretty standard suburban area, with a strong presence of a homeowner's association that maintains the look and feel of the place. As soon as you step in, you'll notice the neatly kept single-family homes, all thanks to the HOA. Every house has a similar front yard with a patch of grass, decorative pebbles, and short driveways. Small trees are scattered around, and everyone has a two-car garage. The roads are also well-maintained, with newly paved concrete and no potholes in sight. The houses are mostly one story, but some have two stories as well. Instead of individual mailboxes, we have a system of shared mailboxes at the end of the street, which requires a key to access. There are also two large lockers for packages - another testament to the HOA's focus on uniformity. Our neighborhood is situated on the outskirts of the nearby city, giving us a mix of rural and suburban vibes. We have plenty of land for everything, including multiple community pools that are well-maintained and gated, and walking trails where you can take your dog or enjoy a peaceful evening stroll. Since most of the community is made up of retired folks, it's a very safe area where everyone looks out for each other. We also have a smaller number of middle-aged and young professionals living here. The nearby city is surprisingly large in terms of population, but it feels like a small town. We have all the amenities you'd expect, including a mall that's not too big but gets the job done. It takes around 15 minutes to drive to significant places, but once you get there, you'll find a variety of stores to choose from, ranging from high-end grocery stores to bargain outlets. Overall, my neighborhood is a safe, well-maintained, and pretty standard place to live, with plenty of nice features like pools and walking trails.",
            "Yesterday, I thought to myself, I really love my little Midwestern town, nestled just outside a bustling city. It's not fancy, but it's home. Our neighborhood on the east side is indeed the most economically challenged area in town, with property values being relatively low. People own or rent houses here, but that's just the way it is. Don't get me wrong, it's not ugly or unpleasant. Everyone in my neighborhood is super friendly. They greet me warmly when I stroll down the street, and we all have a good time chatting. Of course, there's a slightly higher crime rate compared to other parts of town, but we've been lucky so far. I mean, there have been some instances of violence in the past decade, but fortunately, we haven't been directly affected. Our neighbors' son lost his life in a shooting near the local watering hole last year, but we've been fortunate enough to avoid any serious issues like that. The only time we've been affected by crime was when we forgot to bring something inside, and it went missing from our porch. Our town is one of those places that has been hit hard by the opioid epidemic that's sweeping across America. Sadly, many lives have been lost to fentanyl overdoses, but we're fortunate to have plenty of resources to help combat this issue. There are several addiction rehab centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those struggling with addiction.\n\nDespite all this, our town has its bright spots. My son's elementary school is top-notch, with amazing staff from the principal to the teachers and support staff. He's got special needs, but he's never been bullied due to the incredibly positive vibe at school. He loves going there. We have a very active PTO that organizes loads of events throughout the year to get families involved and promote educational progress. Since over 20% of our town's population lives below the poverty line, the school offers free breakfast and lunch to every student, so no child ever goes hungry. No one is looked down upon because they can't pay, and school fees, supplies, and field trips are super reasonable. The City Council and staff have made some great improvements to our town, like fixing roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these upgrades have happened in the center of town and on the west side, where the shopping areas are and most of the traffic passes through. Our side of town tends to get a bit neglected, which is a point of contention for us.\n\nAll in all, I really enjoy living here. People are friendly, the schools are great, and there are plenty of shopping options to meet our needs. Our home might not be worth much, but it's cozy and comfortable. We've been living here for over 16 years, and we can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is a melting pot of diverse cultures, nestled on a hill overlooking a tapestry of historic buildings. I reside in a 7-story apartment complex directly opposite the old theater, with a vibrant arcade bar a short stroll away. This popular hotspot draws in people from all walks of life on warm summer evenings, with long queues forming outside on weekends in June and July. Just a few blocks away lies the local city park, a significant green oasis in the midst of our bustling town. The park is encircled by concrete walls with stairs carved into the structure, providing a cozy abode for the homeless during the cold winter months. They huddle together in neat rows, sheltered from the rain and wind, yet still within walking distance of the local family center where they can access basic amenities like showers and bathing facilities.\n\nWhat I cherish about my neighborhood, however, isn't the grand architecture or the historic charm – it's the people themselves. You see, Hilltop was once notorious for gang violence, and the scars still linger. Even decades later, whispers of federal intervention and DEA crackdowns still circulate among the locals. The community has worked tirelessly to maintain their neighborhood's cleanliness, despite its reputation as one of the rougher areas in the city. They care deeply about their community and its well-being, passing down stories of the past to newcomers like me. A warning often shared among outsiders is that it's not safe to walk the Hill at night if you're white, a stigma that still lingers from the past. I believe this cautionary tale is a product of social conditioning, tainted with the bitter taste of racism and ignorance. Perhaps it's because I've grown accustomed to navigating these complexities, or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of their own – someone who understands the lingering remnants of societal prejudice. Whatever the reason, I know one thing: the Hilltop will always be my home. I feel most alive walking its streets at night, surrounded by people who've offered me kindness and compassion, rather than malice. It's a place where laundromat owners stay open late to help a lost soul, where strangers offer you a jacket on a cold night, and where you're reminded of your worth and beauty in a world that often tries to erase it.",
            "I'm living in Rural America, in the heart of a small town in Michigan. My place is surrounded by farmland and quaint tourist spots, with no massive city malls or big-name stores like Wal-mart, Target, or Applebee's. You need a car to get around here. Despite that, I'm blessed to live in one of the most beautiful spots on earth, flanked by the stunning Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. My hometown is literally surrounded by water, with beaches waiting to be explored. The neighborhood I live in reflects the charm of small-town life. Houses aren't stacked on top of each other like skyscrapers; they're unique, older homes that have been lovingly updated or remodeled over the years. Many of them have basements that can be seen from the road, giving them a cozy, welcoming feel. My neighborhood is a rainbow of colors, with houses sporting every hue imaginable, each one standing out in its own way. Most of these homes have spacious yards, complete with trampolines, playsets, and sometimes even gardens and animal enclosures. It's a quintessential Middle America feel, where families work hard to make a living and raise their kids. On any given day, you'll see kids running up and down the streets, people strolling with their dogs, biking, or rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors, and you can easily spot who fits in and who's a new face. You might catch someone grilling in their yard and wave, or see someone walking their dog from a few blocks away and smile in greeting. The lawns are well-maintained, with neatly trimmed grass and tidy gardens. It's not a picturesque neighborhood that'll leave you awestruck, but it's a place where you'd feel comfortable raising a family. It's quiet, peaceful, and safe. Within walking distance, you'll find the county sheriff's department and jail, the health department, and the local recycling center. We even have baseball and softball fields nearby, where you can hear the announcers calling out the scores and player names. The small-town airport is just a stone's throw away, and you can hear the rumble of small planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream at the local parlor or bike to the nearby park, which is just a short 8 blocks away. It's a fantastic place to call home."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "Lately, I've been living in a bustling city, where the streets are filled with people from all walks of life. My neighborhood is a melting pot, with residential areas scattered among commercial ones. You can find everything from offices to restaurants, stores, and entertainment spots. There are countless new restaurants to try and shops to browse, ranging from big, well-known brands to small, trendy boutiques. These boutiques not only line the malls but also occupy the streets, which are just a short walk from quiet neighborhoods that would otherwise be peaceful. I've noticed that people often visit the nearby parks with their kids, enjoying the fresh air and greenery. The diversity in my neighborhood is quite impressive, with a thriving LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a group of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union all living in the same area. Further afield, there are even more people from different racial and cultural backgrounds, though they often stick together in their own little communities within the city. We have areas like Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia, just a few miles away, but the traffic makes it a pain to get there. Rush hour is especially bad, and it takes a long time to drive short distances. People don't usually walk much in my city, given its size, so the traffic is atrocious, and parking spots are hard to come by. Despite all this, the city is seeing a lot of new construction, with massive apartment buildings going up left and right. While it's great for some, many residents are worried about the added crowds and traffic. My city has a wide range of houses, from single-family homes to apartment buildings and condominiums. It's not all about high-rise apartments; some people prefer to live in smaller, more intimate settings. Even in my own neighborhood, I see a mix of different housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of all ages, and I'm not really familiar with most of my neighbors. It's not the kind of close-knit community it used to be, but I do have fond memories of playing with my next-door neighbor and a few friends from back in the day.",
            "You know, my neighborhood's got a lot of character. Most of the houses are single-family homes, but there are a few that have been split into two, still connected in some way. My place has a tiny front yard and a small driveway to the left, pretty typical of the others. It's like stepping back in time, you know? People used to think that living in the suburbs was the ultimate dream, but now it's not as appealing as it used to be. Yet, my neighborhood's still here, still holding onto that dream, and it's like it's calling out to us, reminding us that it's still alive. The people around here aren't as optimistic as they used to be, the yards aren't as well-maintained as they once were, but you still see a car or two in every driveway, and the kids are still playing like the world revolves around them. The old public school that's been here for almost 90 years is still standing, still giving the kids hope for the future, and it's like a blast from the past for the older folks. There aren't many churches around, and they're mostly empty, but the basketball courts are always packed. All the houses may look different, but they feel the same. There's this huge supermarket called \"Super A\" owned by a large Yemeni family, who are probably the only Arab family in the area. Most of the residents are African American. The streets are wide, and the kids play football, only stopping when cars come by. Most of the people around here have been here for generations, and they've got stories to tell about a time when everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school, but when the karate movie craze died down, the kids lost interest, so now it's a pharmacy. People say that with drugs, everything's better, or so they say. There's also this small movie theater that shows old movies at a discount, kind of a hidden gem, but the kids aren't interested because it's not hip enough, while the older folks think it's a bargain for a night out without the kids, of course. We've got this single expressway that runs through our town, but the entrance and exit are actually in the next town over. There was this petition to get an exit in our town, but it got shot down. The youth wanted it, while the older folks were against it, saying it'd ruin the town. Now, they're building a new high school, and we're trying to decide on a mascot for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the perfect representation of our town.",
            "You might overlook it at first glance, but look closer and you'll discover a whole other world behind the rows of shops and hotels. It's not exactly the kind of place you'd expect to find a community, let alone one that's thriving. But if you venture behind the old Whole Foods, which has long been abandoned, and walk down the road behind the hotels that are only occupied for a short time each summer, you'll stumble upon a bustling neighborhood. Amidst this community are several apartment complexes, situated side by side like a string of carefully placed Russian nesting dolls. The first complex you'll come across has had its fair share of controversy, so we'll skip over that. However, the ones nearby are a different story altogether - a world that remains a secret to most people living in this area.\n\nAcross from these complexes stands a community college's satellite campus, a quiet, sleepy group of buildings that seem to stand guard over the road. Students shuffle in with their coffee, yawning at 7 in the morning as they start their day. The iron gates creak open to let them in one by one, while commuters in their cars shake their fists at the traffic congestion caused by the increased attendance on certain days. The road forks into another residential street, lined with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center on the other, where people recover from unfortunate accidents. The treatment center boasts cheerful outdoor furniture and a lazily spinning ceiling fan that circulates the warm summer air. Children run around in the park, playing tag and cartwheeling in the grass, while bees lazily flit between the flowers by the road. You'll see retirees walking their dogs, scowling at the skateboarders and nodding politely at the teenage girls gossiping by the playground equipment. There's a sushi place in a nearby strip mall with affordable food but always seems to be quiet, alongside a swimming supply store and a nail salon in between. You can fill up your pool for the season while getting a manicure and enjoying some hibachi chicken - the convenience of a strip mall. There's also a frozen yogurt shop where you can add your own toppings, and you often see teenagers in the park clutching cold, sweaty cups of frozen yogurt as they skateboard and vape. This neighborhood is a quintessential slice of Americana, a piece of history in the quiet south where time seems to stand still, unchanged.",
            "As we cruised past the seemingly endless corn fields that stretched as far as the eye could see, she asked, \"Where are we?\" I just smiled knowingly, anticipating the look of shock on her face as she took in the vastness of the open landscape. Coming from a town where the nearby grocery store was just a short 5-minute walk from her front door, she'd never experienced anything like this before. The sheer vastness of the corn fields left her speechless, and I took the opportunity to share with her what it was like growing up in rural Ohio. In that moment, she finally grasped who I was and where I came from.\n\nA two-lane country road led us to a quarry filled with water, followed by the small development where I reside. The houses here are a mix of brick and stucco, each with at least half an acre of land that everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, the area is a kaleidoscope of colors, thanks to the annual flowers and midwestern trees that change with the seasons. You'll also notice the driveways lined with sleek, high-end Mercedes-Benz luxury cars that glisten in the sun after a refreshing wash. As we continued down the road, my neighbor, a friendly Korean man, was out mowing his lawn, singing along to the hum of his John Deere Zero Turn mower. His daily routine brings a smile to everyone's face, and it's not just his cheerful demeanor that makes him special – he's also got a fascinating story to tell.\n\nAs we approached my home, you'd notice the abundance of geese in the side yard, chased by our energetic Terrier. The sound of the nearby stream, bullfrogs, and the occasional moo from the nearby farms created a soothing background melody. Across the handmade wooden bridge lay an untouched oasis, teeming with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was where I spent most of my childhood, building tree forts, 'hunting' animals (which mostly involved chasing them), and making lifelong friends with the other neighborhood kids. Winters in my small town could be harsh, but there was something magical about the transformation. The once lush green yard would turn into an empty wilderness, with bare trees and the occasional snowfall turning it into a winter wonderland overnight. My little sister and I would spend hours making snow angels, building snowmen, and engaging in epic snowball fights. We'd construct massive igloo-like forts, armed with branches, to house our arsenal of snowballs. In that winter wonderland, we were carefree kids, with nothing but the joy of childhood to worry about.",
            "The starting point for any visitor to Portland, Oregon, is to understand what it means to be \"weird\". A sign on the back of a building that serves as a multifaceted hub - a pizza joint, bar, music venue, and more - proudly displays the town's unofficial slogan: \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this phrase is a nostalgic reminder of the city's past, a time when it was less well-known and less expensive, fostering a unique cultural landscape. To others, it's an invitation to come and experience a place where being considered \"weird\" is a badge of honour. Despite an influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of new condominiums, Portland remains an unconventional city. \"Weird\" does not imply a complete rejection of modernity, but rather a willingness to accept the unconventional and the unusual. Like many cities, we consume many of our goods from China. However, Portland has its own brand of normalcy, with yoga enthusiasts, hipsters, and business professionals coexisting with a more eclectic crowd. Perhaps what makes Portland unique is its carefree attitude towards these contrasts. In my own neighbourhood, as with many in Portland, you'll find vibrant houses, lush home gardens, and in the summertime, free boxes lining the streets. Free boxes can contain anything - clothes, books, or even household items - and they're a treasure trove waiting to be discovered. The magic of stumbling upon a hidden gem in a Southeast Portland neighbourhood is what makes this city so special. To me, that's what Portland is all about, but I'm just one of many individuals who call this city home. Some of my neighbours would never dream of rummaging through a free box for second-hand items. Instead, they might attend goat yoga or a Portland Timbers match. What's remarkable about this city is the diversity of interests and passions that its residents possess. We're a city of dreamers, both those who are actively pursuing their passions and those who are still daydreaming about them, often over a drink at a local bar. Of course, like many cities, Portland struggles with substance abuse issues, which often stem from deeper mental health problems. The city's signature grey skies and constant rain may also contribute to this issue. Additionally, Portland faces a homelessness crisis, which is a challenge that many cities grapple with. While we offer better social services than some other parts of the country, they're still insufficient. The general public is torn between sympathy and frustration towards the homeless population. In this regard, Portland is not so weird after all.",
            "The mountains have always stood tall, a constant presence in the north, silently witnessing the dawn and dusk of each day. Unfazed by the turmoil of life, their steadfastness is a comforting reminder, especially when I'm consumed by stress and anxiety. It's as if they beckon me to come closer, offering a respite for my weary soul. I first laid eyes on them when I started my undergrad, and they've held a special place in my heart ever since. While the university has its own share of breathtaking spots, the mountains are the true crown jewel. The rest of the town has its own charm, with quaint cafes and old buildings that exude an air of history. Yet, it's the mountains that draw me in, their rugged grandeur a stark contrast to the bustling downtown area. The town's duality is a fascinating aspect - from the vibrant high street to the serene library, each area has its unique character. It's this contrast that makes the town so captivating, as if it's inviting me to explore and create memories. Whether it's strolling through the park with friends or racing through the downtown streets to catch the latest movie, every part of town holds a special place in my heart. However, it's also a place where painful memories reside, much like anywhere else in life. The ponds, in particular, have been a sanctuary for me, a place to reflect and cry during the darkest moments. As I watched the turtles and ducks living their lives, I couldn't help but ponder my own purpose and the mysteries of life. I'd walk past the pond, the park, and the houses, until I reached the main street, where the sun would paint the sky with its vibrant hues. And as I looked up at the sunrise, I'd realize I was walking north, drawn to the mountains that stood tall, a constant reminder of my determination.",
            "If you're planning a trip to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, don't worry - you'll have no issue finding it. The area is well-connected to public transportation, which is one of the most popular ways to get around New York City. Bensonhurst itself is an urban neighborhood, offering the hustle and bustle of the city. When exploring, you'll notice a plethora of Asian stores scattered throughout the area. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurst has seen a significant influx of Asian residents, resulting in an abundance of Asian-owned businesses - at least one per block. You'll likely find yourself surrounded by Asian-owned supermarkets and laundromats. These businesses are extremely popular among locals, offering top-notch food, affordable prices, and unparalleled convenience. I'm lucky enough to be close to four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walking distance from each other. This convenience makes accessing grocery shopping a breeze. While Bensonhurst isn't exclusively occupied by Asian residents, the area is culturally diverse, with immigrants and their children from various generations calling it home.\n\nMajority-owned businesses in the area are Asian-owned, but you'll also find a beautifully renovated park nearby, boasting over ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy in the summer. As you're in the heart of New York City, expect to see an array of diversity in the park, with people from all walks of life getting along harmoniously. Unlike other areas in the city, Bensonhurst doesn't have large corporate buildings; instead, you'll find co-op living spaces and condominium apartments. The majority of the living spaces are two-family houses. The locals are generally nice but can be a bit rowdy. Be prepared for loud cars blasting music as you walk by or people flooring their gas in the morning, which might wake you up. If you're planning a nighttime visit, be cautious - the neighborhood is generally safe, but you might encounter people looking for trouble or bullies. I've personally experienced bullying in the past, but it was a long time ago. More recently, there have been incidents of package theft. While it's a common issue elsewhere, package thieves do exist in Bensonhurst. One of my pet peeves is the lack of cleanliness in the neighborhood - specifically, dog waste everywhere. Be mindful of your surroundings, especially in the mornings, and keep your shoes clean!",
            "I live in a place with very limited sidewalks. Our house sits at the top of a steep hill in the neighborhood, which makes it a great spot for joggers to get a good workout. They often refer to it as the \"workout hill.\" Since there are no sidewalks on my street, everyone has to walk on the road, which can be a bit hazardous due to potholes and uneven surfaces. The telephone and electric wires surrounding my neighborhood are often in disrepair, with tattered-looking cables and patchwork repairs from frequent storm damage. We get a lot of rain and storms here, which causes branches and debris to fall on the power lines. \n\nThe area is surrounded by tall evergreen trees, but people around here aren't fans of them. They try to cut them down as much as possible because they block the view of the ocean. As a result, many houses are built high up on the hill with large glass windows to take in the view of the bay. It's beautiful during sunset when the water below is lit up and the sky turns orange. However, most days are overcast and cloudy, making it hard to see the sunlight clearly. Moss grows everywhere, from roofs to cars to railings, due to the constant dampness. I once left my car outside for a month, and when I returned, it was covered in moss and took me hours to clean off. The neighborhood is mostly made up of older residents, with many retirees. We don't have many kids around, but there's a school not far away. Instead of kids, we have a lot of dogs running around. They often sit in front of houses or chase each other down the street. If you leave a door or window open, they might sneak in. I once found one in my living room and had to shoo it out. Rabbits are also common in our area, and they can cause problems for gardeners by digging up plant roots and burrowing into lawns. However, my cats love them and have managed to hunt most of them out of our neighborhood. We also have a variety of birds, including small sparrows, hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle that gets chased off by the neighborhood crows. If you're willing to hike down to the waterfront, there are some restaurants that serve fresh seafood, but the beach itself is small and not very wide. You can still see the opposite shoreline clearly even on misty days.",
            "I live in a typical suburban area in a small town in the southern part of Tennessee. Our street is a connecting route between two state highways, resulting in a moderate amount of traffic, which I don't always enjoy. However, the neighborhood remains relatively quiet, with not too many people moving in and out. I've grown accustomed to the familiar faces that live around here. Most residents spend their days tending to their yards and other daily tasks. In the winter, we enjoy sledding down a nearby hill on our street. Our house, located at the corner of our street, allows us to see everyone passing by and become familiar with the vehicles that frequent our area. Whenever a stranger's car passes by, we tend to take notice. Some of our neighbors go for walks or take their dogs out for exercise. Kids can often be seen riding their bikes and engaging in typical neighborhood activities. Since we work from home, we're often at home, along with my wife and our two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen. As a result, everyone is used to seeing us come and go. We enjoy spending time outside, even on rainy days. Occasionally, we fire up the grill on our back deck, and the delicious smell of barbecue fills the air. The sounds of lawn mowers are a regular occurrence from March to October, when the grass growth slows down. Our neighborhood was originally a wooded area, so we have plenty of trees providing shade, but also a lot of leaves in the fall, which means raking and burning them every year. I enjoy the smell of burning leaves, marking the arrival of fall. Lately, we've been experiencing mild winters, making it feel like an extended fall season. Our garage is located at the back of our house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone knocks, which is a rare occurrence. I like tinkering with my truck or other projects in the garage, and when the doors are open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, the neighborhood is relatively quiet, with some families visiting from out of town during special occasions like Thanksgiving and Christmas. If it weren't a through street, I think our neighborhood would be perfect.",
            "I live in a neighborhood that's smack in the middle of the high desert, where the landscape is dominated by dirt and dust. Unless you've experienced living here, it's hard to grasp the feeling of seeing nothing but brown everywhere you look. It's not until you spot a lawn that you realize the owner must be breaking the bank to keep it looking that way. When I first moved here in the 90s, houses were spread out, but nowadays, it's pretty much the same, with some new additions popping up. The area is slowly transforming into a city, but I suppose that's a trend we see everywhere. On the plus side, the people here are generally friendly, though, just like any city, we have our good and bad sides. I'm surrounded by friendly, older folks, which makes it a nice neighborhood. The shopping scene is pretty basic, with just the usual chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you're looking for something upscale, you'll have to drive a bit. You won't find any Whole Foods or similar stores around here. The main industries in my city seem to be construction, which makes sense, given how undeveloped the area still is, with plenty of open spaces left to build on. That's a bit unsettling, but after living in a big city, I'm not eager to go back. My job is actually in the construction industry – I work as a drywall and T-bar installer. One thing I appreciate about my home is the diverse wildlife. People come to the high desert for its natural beauty, and it's home to unique ecosystems that need protecting. It's essential for human residents to learn about the non-human inhabitants of our environment to live in harmony. My family and I have adapted well to the local wildlife. My three kids are obsessed with lizards and desert bugs, and as I write this, they're outside trying to catch different specimens. As for attractions, we have a few. Victorville is a great place for families to experience the desert, and if you can, plan your visit to coincide with the annual San Bernardino County Fair. The fair offers a great mix of activities and fun in the Victorville style. If you head to nearby Wrightwood, you can see the snow-covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to cap off your visit. If you're interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem, the Victor Valley Museum is a great place to start. It features geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of Victorville's development and industry.",
            "When someone asks me to describe my neighbourhood, I'm pretty sure my answer would be quite unique. Unlike others who might be homeowners with their own life, my situation is a bit different. My neighbourhood is where I'm studying, and the people living in my dorm are like my community. The surrounding campus is part of my neighbourhood as well, but to a lesser extent. Although my neighbourhood is a bit unconventional, it shares some qualities with the typical idea of a neighbourhood. For instance, it has houses, people, shops and parks, just like any normal neighbourhood. Let's start with the \"houses\" that make up my neighbourhood. Before I dive into that, I should clarify the types of houses you can find around here. There are three types: apartments, houses, and dormitory houses. Firstly, the apartments usually have 2-4 people in each room, and there are 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type has about 2 floors, so there are around 20 people living in each building. Next, there are the houses that are available for rent, usually with 2-4 bedrooms. They're mostly occupied by alumni, but there aren't many of them around. Finally, there are the dorm rooms, where you'll find hundreds of students sharing rooms with one other person, except for a few exceptions. It's the most common type of housing in my neighbourhood. Now that we've covered the houses, let's talk about the people. My school values diversity, and it's reflected in my neighbourhood. People from all walks of life and different ages live here. The professional staff live in the houses, while the new students stay in the dorms and the older students in the apartments. Since my school is essentially a self-contained neighbourhood, it has plenty of shops and a single park. The shops offer a mix of food options and the school's own brands of clothing and groceries, so you can get anything you need without leaving. The park is a playground for everyone in the neighbourhood, kept clean and safe by all of us who live here.",
            "Well, after 10 years of living here, I think I can share my experiences with you. When I first moved to this neighborhood, I was pretty sad. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge with my family, and I have to admit, I cried because I missed my old home and friends. But my parents wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for a house, a better high school, and a more comfortable life. As time went by, I started to get used to the new place and made some new friends, but also encountered some not-so-friendly people in school. I didn't really get to know my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his family, and Dennis, who lived right next to us. They're wonderful people whom I consider as a kind of family, and I appreciate them greatly.\n\nI still remember when we went to Mr. Glen's wedding. It was a fun and memorable day, and I'm looking forward to experiencing something similar in the future when I settle down and give my future partner the life they deserve. When Mr. Glen's wife, Ms. Veda, removed her white strap and threw it, I managed to catch it, but unfortunately, I missed catching the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I enjoyed spending time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven't seen her since, but I hope she's doing well and pursuing her dreams.\n\nLiving in this neighborhood can be a bit confusing at times, but with the help of GPS, I've been able to explore it more. I've only ventured out with my friends Kason and Curtis so far, and we used to spend hours playing video games and enjoying life to the fullest. Sometimes I'd visit the park to connect with nature and find some peace. It's amazing how it can calm my mind and soothe my soul. I'd also bring sticks I bought from Home Depot and practice my balance, and sometimes I'd take my wooden sword, the bokken, with me. I love doing what I love and having fun.\n\nWe also have a basketball and tennis court in the neighborhood, although I haven't played tennis or basketball in a while. It's nice to have them available if I ever want to pick up the sport again. My dad taught me and my best friend to play tennis with Mr. Graves, and we always had a great time, even though they made us work hard. But that's what made it so enjoyable. I've had many wonderful experiences in this neighborhood, and there are more stories to share, but these are the ones that stand out to me, and I'm excited to see what the future holds.",
            "My place is literally just a stone's throw away from my college, which is why I'm so fond of living here. I have the luxury of living amidst apartment buildings, some cheap eateries, and a few bars that are fun to hang out at without burning a hole in my pocket. One of the bars just got a new name, and it's a bit pricier, but the quality of service and drinks are decent, and the people there are quite friendly. They're either students or low-income residents, considering the affordable apartment prices. There's a bunch of kids around since the nearby elementary school is within walking distance, but I don't really know my neighbors. They smoke a lot of weed, and the management of my building installed an air freshener right in front of their door, which my boyfriend and I found hilarious - it's almost like they're being mocked. The buildings around me are a bit old-looking, but maybe they've got renovated insides. A bit down the street, there are brand new apartments that look fancy, but I'm not a fan of them. They claim to be high-end but I'm pretty sure they're cheaply built, and the rent is way too steep. I think it's just a rip-off, but I guess since they're close to campus, the management can get away with it. There's a super cheap restaurant just about five minutes from my place that serves paper plates with mostly microwaved food. I also have a gas station right across from it, which, I've heard, isn't a great place to work. However, thanks to some city funds, the road was renovated last summer, and now we have a nice wide sidewalk, decent grass, and a more pleasant atmosphere. My apartment building is pretty shaded with trees, but the management cut a few down, leaving stumps behind. There are way more trees where I live compared to the other side of the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line, and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but just behind it is 43rd street, which isn't as nice. The sidewalks are all crumbled, and the buildings look shabby. There are a lot of trees there too, but I think they're just to hide the state of the buildings. Most of the crime in my area happens at an apartment complex on that street, but I'm not gonna blame just them - it's a problem that affects the whole area. There are apartments across the street from me that have their own share of crime and a rather transient population. Still, I like where I live. It's affordable, and there are plenty of useful amenities nearby, including the university and two bus stops that make it easy for me to get to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighbourhood is a quiet haven, composed of double-storey houses on a cul-de-sac. The homes are spaced out, giving the illusion of being individual houses. However, they all share the same distinct features - a vibrant yellow exterior, crisp white porches, and emerald green metal roofs. While most residents are friendly with one another, not everyone is acquaintances. We often gather at the end of a winding driveway in the evenings, engaging in casual conversations as the neighbourhood kids play with their toys, colour with sidewalk chalk, or fly their kites. It's a refreshing respite from the fast-paced, tech-obsessed world we live in, reminiscent of a bygone era. The scenery is picturesque - rolling fields, towering trees, and a brilliant blue sky dotted with puffy white clouds. Yet, Mother Nature can be unpredictable. This season, we've been plagued by tornado warnings, and for the first time, we heard the eerie sound of actual tornado sirens last night, prompting us to seek shelter. I found myself taking refuge in my bathtub, clutching my smallest dog and essentials, while my bigger dog remained in the living room, anxious and barking. The neighbourhood was eerily quiet, except for the deafening sound of large hail pounding the ground. As the storm passed, the temperature plummeted from 92 to 75 degrees in a matter of minutes. The hail instantly melted upon hitting the scorching pavement. As the skies cleared, the sun peeked through, and a double rainbow appeared. I quickly grabbed my camera to capture the breathtaking scene, eager to share it with my friends and family on Facebook. They, like me, were amazed by the spectacle. The streets remained deserted for another hour before people began returning home from wherever they were when the storm struck. Once again, life returned to normal - dinner was cooking, and mothers and children were outside enjoying the evening. As a transplant from New Hampshire to North Carolina, I've grown fond of the region's distinct southern drawl. My two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment, like everyone else's, may look identical from the outside, but each has its unique character inside. Some are surprisingly compact, leaving me perplexed. I cherish strolling through the expansive field behind my home, making my way to the pond, which, unfortunately, isn't suitable for swimming. I've spotted deer and, in the mornings, I'm serenaded by the deep, melodic song of the giant bullfrog. It's a fantastic place to call home, situated just 40 minutes from the bustling city of Charlotte. Each morning begins with the cheerful sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms, giving our neighbourhood a village-like atmosphere. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that brays in the evening, letting us know he's still there. I feel fortunate to have discovered this hidden gem of a neighbourhood.",
            "It was during my 8th grade year when I moved into this neighbourhood. It took me a while to make friends, but I eventually became close with two guys, one who lives just two houses down and another on the same street. Although neither of them lives here anymore, the memories we made together still linger. The people who were here when I first arrived are still here, for the most part. My neighbourhood is pretty much like any other American suburb. There are plenty of two-storey houses, and on warm days, I can hear the kids playing outside every weekend. Most days are quiet, but you're never left on your own unless you need help. I've ordered several packages online without any issues, and my neighbours are trustworthy. Just a minute or two away from my house is a park where I've spent many happy times. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there with my friends, and it's also where I got one of my worst injuries - a nasty elbow to the nose while playing football. However, the good memories far outweigh the bad. These days, I visit the park with my cousin's kids. They're still young and love playing on the swings and slides. The thought of going to the park always brings back a flood of memories. The neighbourhood is quite diverse, and you can find all sorts of food nearby. Within a one-mile radius, there are Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants, although many people now prefer ordering food through apps like GrubHub and DoorDash. The most popular places are fast food shops, but you can find those just about anywhere. There are also many pizza places. The stores here have everything you could ever need, including multiple dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is a staple in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even run by Indians, catering to those who want to cook homemade Indian food or buy ready-made dishes. All in all, I'm a big fan of my neighbourhood. Seeing the horror stories on social media and news about people's experiences with their neighbours makes me grateful for the ones I have.",
            "My hometown of Johnston is a charming little place that doesn't stand out from the rest of the towns in South Carolina, but it holds a significant influence in the agricultural sector. It proudly claims to be the Peach Capital of the World, a title showcased on the welcoming sign at the town's entrance. The landscape is mainly dominated by vast farmlands of either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't situated in the town center are spaced out, with most being two-story homes featuring metal roofs to combat the scorching summer heat or gray shingles. These homes are often situated away from the main road, allowing for the front fields to be used for farming. In the town center, there's only one traffic light at a four-way intersection. It's here that you'll find the town's few stores. There are three options for quick bites: Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. A pizzeria used to be in operation, but it closed down a while ago. Maxwell and Halford Drug is a small family-owned pharmacy that's surprisingly famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola. Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA for short, is a small and pricey grocery store that's the town's only option. While it's the main grocery store, many residents prefer to travel to the Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville to buy most of their groceries. The most popular store in town, though, is Dollar General, which sells a wide variety of everyday essentials and is always bustling from opening to closing. There's also a small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind community figure who employs two movers to deliver purchased items. Right next door is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a small pet grooming service that offers various services like daycare, boarding, grooming, and more. Both the doctor's office and veterinary clinic are located outside the town center, but they're well-equipped to serve the town's residents. We have a single elementary school, Johnston Elementary School, which serves students up to fifth grade. After that, students move on to middle and high school in the neighboring town. Although there aren't any parks within the town, a new 2.5-acre recreational area is currently under construction to provide families with more opportunities for outings and attract new visitors or residents. Despite its limited attractions, Johnston is a nice place that's so small you could drive right by without even noticing it.",
            "The first time I heard about my place, it was while listening to a podcast about people who went missing. It left a surprising impression on me. Almost every apartment in the area was renting for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story before, and my friends hadn't either. It made me think about the struggles we all face. I know some of my friends struggle to sleep at night because of the costs. Things are expensive, but over time, we've learned to be thrifty. You start to accept the dusty smell of flea market items and worn-out clothes. You notice you smell less in adulthood. You might start smoking or become accustomed to the way things are. However, the flea market always manages to assert itself. The smell of adulthood is the musty smell of old magazines on an old piano, which even washing the piano can't remove. Here, there're three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can visit two charity stores, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curio shop. Downtown is crowded, with cars and people filling the streets every morning, but inside the thrift stores, you'll find silence. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store remains quiet. It's a nice place to spend an afternoon. Every year, the area gets busier, with more cars and people flooding the streets. It's a developing city, they say. As one of the largest e-commerce and delivery empires is headquartered here, it's still dealing with growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone's focused on their goals, and nobody really asks for much. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's different from the South, where showing a little concern means you care. You don't pry into people's lives here; you can keep your shell as long as you like, and the city will move along like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. There's always something going on, whether it's the pianist next door or the two amateur singers upstairs. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. I feel fortunate to live here. I quite like my neighbors, and they treat me well. I try to keep my apartment clean and leave food for them, and they do the same for me. I bring their mail, and they bring mine. It's nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my presence just as much as I do theirs. Despite living in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl, it's my neighbors who make me feel like I haven't ruined my life completely.",
            "My neighborhood is a pretty standard suburban area, with a strong presence of a homeowner's association that maintains the look and feel of the place. As soon as you step in, you'll notice the neatly kept single-family homes, all thanks to the HOA. Every house has a similar front yard with a patch of grass, decorative pebbles, and short driveways. Small trees are scattered around, and everyone has a two-car garage. The roads are also well-maintained, with newly paved concrete and no potholes in sight. The houses are mostly one story, but some have two stories as well. Instead of individual mailboxes, we have a system of shared mailboxes at the end of the street, which requires a key to access. There are also two large lockers for packages - another testament to the HOA's focus on uniformity. Our neighborhood is situated on the outskirts of the nearby city, giving us a mix of rural and suburban vibes. We have plenty of land for everything, including multiple community pools that are well-maintained and gated, and walking trails where you can take your dog or enjoy a peaceful evening stroll. Since most of the community is made up of retired folks, it's a very safe area where everyone looks out for each other. We also have a smaller number of middle-aged and young professionals living here. The nearby city is surprisingly large in terms of population, but it feels like a small town. We have all the amenities you'd expect, including a mall that's not too big but gets the job done. It takes around 15 minutes to drive to significant places, but once you get there, you'll find a variety of stores to choose from, ranging from high-end grocery stores to bargain outlets. Overall, my neighborhood is a safe, well-maintained, and pretty standard place to live, with plenty of nice features like pools and walking trails.",
            "Yesterday, I thought to myself, I really love my little Midwestern town, nestled just outside a bustling city. It's not fancy, but it's home. Our neighborhood on the east side is indeed the most economically challenged area in town, with property values being relatively low. People own or rent houses here, but that's just the way it is. Don't get me wrong, it's not ugly or unpleasant. Everyone in my neighborhood is super friendly. They greet me warmly when I stroll down the street, and we all have a good time chatting. Of course, there's a slightly higher crime rate compared to other parts of town, but we've been lucky so far. I mean, there have been some instances of violence in the past decade, but fortunately, we haven't been directly affected. Our neighbors' son lost his life in a shooting near the local watering hole last year, but we've been fortunate enough to avoid any serious issues like that. The only time we've been affected by crime was when we forgot to bring something inside, and it went missing from our porch. Our town is one of those places that has been hit hard by the opioid epidemic that's sweeping across America. Sadly, many lives have been lost to fentanyl overdoses, but we're fortunate to have plenty of resources to help combat this issue. There are several addiction rehab centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those struggling with addiction.\n\nDespite all this, our town has its bright spots. My son's elementary school is top-notch, with amazing staff from the principal to the teachers and support staff. He's got special needs, but he's never been bullied due to the incredibly positive vibe at school. He loves going there. We have a very active PTO that organizes loads of events throughout the year to get families involved and promote educational progress. Since over 20% of our town's population lives below the poverty line, the school offers free breakfast and lunch to every student, so no child ever goes hungry. No one is looked down upon because they can't pay, and school fees, supplies, and field trips are super reasonable. The City Council and staff have made some great improvements to our town, like fixing roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these upgrades have happened in the center of town and on the west side, where the shopping areas are and most of the traffic passes through. Our side of town tends to get a bit neglected, which is a point of contention for us.\n\nAll in all, I really enjoy living here. People are friendly, the schools are great, and there are plenty of shopping options to meet our needs. Our home might not be worth much, but it's cozy and comfortable. We've been living here for over 16 years, and we can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is a melting pot of diverse cultures, nestled on a hill overlooking a tapestry of historic buildings. I reside in a 7-story apartment complex directly opposite the old theater, with a vibrant arcade bar a short stroll away. This popular hotspot draws in people from all walks of life on warm summer evenings, with long queues forming outside on weekends in June and July. Just a few blocks away lies the local city park, a significant green oasis in the midst of our bustling town. The park is encircled by concrete walls with stairs carved into the structure, providing a cozy abode for the homeless during the cold winter months. They huddle together in neat rows, sheltered from the rain and wind, yet still within walking distance of the local family center where they can access basic amenities like showers and bathing facilities.\n\nWhat I cherish about my neighborhood, however, isn't the grand architecture or the historic charm – it's the people themselves. You see, Hilltop was once notorious for gang violence, and the scars still linger. Even decades later, whispers of federal intervention and DEA crackdowns still circulate among the locals. The community has worked tirelessly to maintain their neighborhood's cleanliness, despite its reputation as one of the rougher areas in the city. They care deeply about their community and its well-being, passing down stories of the past to newcomers like me. A warning often shared among outsiders is that it's not safe to walk the Hill at night if you're white, a stigma that still lingers from the past. I believe this cautionary tale is a product of social conditioning, tainted with the bitter taste of racism and ignorance. Perhaps it's because I've grown accustomed to navigating these complexities, or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of their own – someone who understands the lingering remnants of societal prejudice. Whatever the reason, I know one thing: the Hilltop will always be my home. I feel most alive walking its streets at night, surrounded by people who've offered me kindness and compassion, rather than malice. It's a place where laundromat owners stay open late to help a lost soul, where strangers offer you a jacket on a cold night, and where you're reminded of your worth and beauty in a world that often tries to erase it.",
            "I'm living in Rural America, in the heart of a small town in Michigan. My place is surrounded by farmland and quaint tourist spots, with no massive city malls or big-name stores like Wal-mart, Target, or Applebee's. You need a car to get around here. Despite that, I'm blessed to live in one of the most beautiful spots on earth, flanked by the stunning Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. My hometown is literally surrounded by water, with beaches waiting to be explored. The neighborhood I live in reflects the charm of small-town life. Houses aren't stacked on top of each other like skyscrapers; they're unique, older homes that have been lovingly updated or remodeled over the years. Many of them have basements that can be seen from the road, giving them a cozy, welcoming feel. My neighborhood is a rainbow of colors, with houses sporting every hue imaginable, each one standing out in its own way. Most of these homes have spacious yards, complete with trampolines, playsets, and sometimes even gardens and animal enclosures. It's a quintessential Middle America feel, where families work hard to make a living and raise their kids. On any given day, you'll see kids running up and down the streets, people strolling with their dogs, biking, or rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors, and you can easily spot who fits in and who's a new face. You might catch someone grilling in their yard and wave, or see someone walking their dog from a few blocks away and smile in greeting. The lawns are well-maintained, with neatly trimmed grass and tidy gardens. It's not a picturesque neighborhood that'll leave you awestruck, but it's a place where you'd feel comfortable raising a family. It's quiet, peaceful, and safe. Within walking distance, you'll find the county sheriff's department and jail, the health department, and the local recycling center. We even have baseball and softball fields nearby, where you can hear the announcers calling out the scores and player names. The small-town airport is just a stone's throw away, and you can hear the rumble of small planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream at the local parlor or bike to the nearby park, which is just a short 8 blocks away. It's a fantastic place to call home."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "Lately, I've been living in a bustling city, where the streets are filled with people from all walks of life. My neighborhood is a melting pot, with residential areas scattered among commercial ones. You can find everything from offices to restaurants, stores, and entertainment spots. There are countless new restaurants to try and shops to browse, ranging from big, well-known brands to small, trendy boutiques. These boutiques not only line the malls but also occupy the streets, which are just a short walk from quiet neighborhoods that would otherwise be peaceful. I've noticed that people often visit the nearby parks with their kids, enjoying the fresh air and greenery. The diversity in my neighborhood is quite impressive, with a thriving LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a group of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union all living in the same area. Further afield, there are even more people from different racial and cultural backgrounds, though they often stick together in their own little communities within the city. We have areas like Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia, just a few miles away, but the traffic makes it a pain to get there. Rush hour is especially bad, and it takes a long time to drive short distances. People don't usually walk much in my city, given its size, so the traffic is atrocious, and parking spots are hard to come by. Despite all this, the city is seeing a lot of new construction, with massive apartment buildings going up left and right. While it's great for some, many residents are worried about the added crowds and traffic. My city has a wide range of houses, from single-family homes to apartment buildings and condominiums. It's not all about high-rise apartments; some people prefer to live in smaller, more intimate settings. Even in my own neighborhood, I see a mix of different housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of all ages, and I'm not really familiar with most of my neighbors. It's not the kind of close-knit community it used to be, but I do have fond memories of playing with my next-door neighbor and a few friends from back in the day.",
            "You know, my neighborhood's got a lot of character. Most of the houses are single-family homes, but there are a few that have been split into two, still connected in some way. My place has a tiny front yard and a small driveway to the left, pretty typical of the others. It's like stepping back in time, you know? People used to think that living in the suburbs was the ultimate dream, but now it's not as appealing as it used to be. Yet, my neighborhood's still here, still holding onto that dream, and it's like it's calling out to us, reminding us that it's still alive. The people around here aren't as optimistic as they used to be, the yards aren't as well-maintained as they once were, but you still see a car or two in every driveway, and the kids are still playing like the world revolves around them. The old public school that's been here for almost 90 years is still standing, still giving the kids hope for the future, and it's like a blast from the past for the older folks. There aren't many churches around, and they're mostly empty, but the basketball courts are always packed. All the houses may look different, but they feel the same. There's this huge supermarket called \"Super A\" owned by a large Yemeni family, who are probably the only Arab family in the area. Most of the residents are African American. The streets are wide, and the kids play football, only stopping when cars come by. Most of the people around here have been here for generations, and they've got stories to tell about a time when everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school, but when the karate movie craze died down, the kids lost interest, so now it's a pharmacy. People say that with drugs, everything's better, or so they say. There's also this small movie theater that shows old movies at a discount, kind of a hidden gem, but the kids aren't interested because it's not hip enough, while the older folks think it's a bargain for a night out without the kids, of course. We've got this single expressway that runs through our town, but the entrance and exit are actually in the next town over. There was this petition to get an exit in our town, but it got shot down. The youth wanted it, while the older folks were against it, saying it'd ruin the town. Now, they're building a new high school, and we're trying to decide on a mascot for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the perfect representation of our town.",
            "You might overlook it at first glance, but look closer and you'll discover a whole other world behind the rows of shops and hotels. It's not exactly the kind of place you'd expect to find a community, let alone one that's thriving. But if you venture behind the old Whole Foods, which has long been abandoned, and walk down the road behind the hotels that are only occupied for a short time each summer, you'll stumble upon a bustling neighborhood. Amidst this community are several apartment complexes, situated side by side like a string of carefully placed Russian nesting dolls. The first complex you'll come across has had its fair share of controversy, so we'll skip over that. However, the ones nearby are a different story altogether - a world that remains a secret to most people living in this area.\n\nAcross from these complexes stands a community college's satellite campus, a quiet, sleepy group of buildings that seem to stand guard over the road. Students shuffle in with their coffee, yawning at 7 in the morning as they start their day. The iron gates creak open to let them in one by one, while commuters in their cars shake their fists at the traffic congestion caused by the increased attendance on certain days. The road forks into another residential street, lined with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center on the other, where people recover from unfortunate accidents. The treatment center boasts cheerful outdoor furniture and a lazily spinning ceiling fan that circulates the warm summer air. Children run around in the park, playing tag and cartwheeling in the grass, while bees lazily flit between the flowers by the road. You'll see retirees walking their dogs, scowling at the skateboarders and nodding politely at the teenage girls gossiping by the playground equipment. There's a sushi place in a nearby strip mall with affordable food but always seems to be quiet, alongside a swimming supply store and a nail salon in between. You can fill up your pool for the season while getting a manicure and enjoying some hibachi chicken - the convenience of a strip mall. There's also a frozen yogurt shop where you can add your own toppings, and you often see teenagers in the park clutching cold, sweaty cups of frozen yogurt as they skateboard and vape. This neighborhood is a quintessential slice of Americana, a piece of history in the quiet south where time seems to stand still, unchanged.",
            "As we cruised past the seemingly endless corn fields that stretched as far as the eye could see, she asked, \"Where are we?\" I just smiled knowingly, anticipating the look of shock on her face as she took in the vastness of the open landscape. Coming from a town where the nearby grocery store was just a short 5-minute walk from her front door, she'd never experienced anything like this before. The sheer vastness of the corn fields left her speechless, and I took the opportunity to share with her what it was like growing up in rural Ohio. In that moment, she finally grasped who I was and where I came from.\n\nA two-lane country road led us to a quarry filled with water, followed by the small development where I reside. The houses here are a mix of brick and stucco, each with at least half an acre of land that everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, the area is a kaleidoscope of colors, thanks to the annual flowers and midwestern trees that change with the seasons. You'll also notice the driveways lined with sleek, high-end Mercedes-Benz luxury cars that glisten in the sun after a refreshing wash. As we continued down the road, my neighbor, a friendly Korean man, was out mowing his lawn, singing along to the hum of his John Deere Zero Turn mower. His daily routine brings a smile to everyone's face, and it's not just his cheerful demeanor that makes him special – he's also got a fascinating story to tell.\n\nAs we approached my home, you'd notice the abundance of geese in the side yard, chased by our energetic Terrier. The sound of the nearby stream, bullfrogs, and the occasional moo from the nearby farms created a soothing background melody. Across the handmade wooden bridge lay an untouched oasis, teeming with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was where I spent most of my childhood, building tree forts, 'hunting' animals (which mostly involved chasing them), and making lifelong friends with the other neighborhood kids. Winters in my small town could be harsh, but there was something magical about the transformation. The once lush green yard would turn into an empty wilderness, with bare trees and the occasional snowfall turning it into a winter wonderland overnight. My little sister and I would spend hours making snow angels, building snowmen, and engaging in epic snowball fights. We'd construct massive igloo-like forts, armed with branches, to house our arsenal of snowballs. In that winter wonderland, we were carefree kids, with nothing but the joy of childhood to worry about.",
            "The starting point for any visitor to Portland, Oregon, is to understand what it means to be \"weird\". A sign on the back of a building that serves as a multifaceted hub - a pizza joint, bar, music venue, and more - proudly displays the town's unofficial slogan: \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this phrase is a nostalgic reminder of the city's past, a time when it was less well-known and less expensive, fostering a unique cultural landscape. To others, it's an invitation to come and experience a place where being considered \"weird\" is a badge of honour. Despite an influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of new condominiums, Portland remains an unconventional city. \"Weird\" does not imply a complete rejection of modernity, but rather a willingness to accept the unconventional and the unusual. Like many cities, we consume many of our goods from China. However, Portland has its own brand of normalcy, with yoga enthusiasts, hipsters, and business professionals coexisting with a more eclectic crowd. Perhaps what makes Portland unique is its carefree attitude towards these contrasts. In my own neighbourhood, as with many in Portland, you'll find vibrant houses, lush home gardens, and in the summertime, free boxes lining the streets. Free boxes can contain anything - clothes, books, or even household items - and they're a treasure trove waiting to be discovered. The magic of stumbling upon a hidden gem in a Southeast Portland neighbourhood is what makes this city so special. To me, that's what Portland is all about, but I'm just one of many individuals who call this city home. Some of my neighbours would never dream of rummaging through a free box for second-hand items. Instead, they might attend goat yoga or a Portland Timbers match. What's remarkable about this city is the diversity of interests and passions that its residents possess. We're a city of dreamers, both those who are actively pursuing their passions and those who are still daydreaming about them, often over a drink at a local bar. Of course, like many cities, Portland struggles with substance abuse issues, which often stem from deeper mental health problems. The city's signature grey skies and constant rain may also contribute to this issue. Additionally, Portland faces a homelessness crisis, which is a challenge that many cities grapple with. While we offer better social services than some other parts of the country, they're still insufficient. The general public is torn between sympathy and frustration towards the homeless population. In this regard, Portland is not so weird after all.",
            "The mountains have always stood tall, a constant presence in the north, silently witnessing the dawn and dusk of each day. Unfazed by the turmoil of life, their steadfastness is a comforting reminder, especially when I'm consumed by stress and anxiety. It's as if they beckon me to come closer, offering a respite for my weary soul. I first laid eyes on them when I started my undergrad, and they've held a special place in my heart ever since. While the university has its own share of breathtaking spots, the mountains are the true crown jewel. The rest of the town has its own charm, with quaint cafes and old buildings that exude an air of history. Yet, it's the mountains that draw me in, their rugged grandeur a stark contrast to the bustling downtown area. The town's duality is a fascinating aspect - from the vibrant high street to the serene library, each area has its unique character. It's this contrast that makes the town so captivating, as if it's inviting me to explore and create memories. Whether it's strolling through the park with friends or racing through the downtown streets to catch the latest movie, every part of town holds a special place in my heart. However, it's also a place where painful memories reside, much like anywhere else in life. The ponds, in particular, have been a sanctuary for me, a place to reflect and cry during the darkest moments. As I watched the turtles and ducks living their lives, I couldn't help but ponder my own purpose and the mysteries of life. I'd walk past the pond, the park, and the houses, until I reached the main street, where the sun would paint the sky with its vibrant hues. And as I looked up at the sunrise, I'd realize I was walking north, drawn to the mountains that stood tall, a constant reminder of my determination.",
            "If you're planning a trip to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, don't worry - you'll have no issue finding it. The area is well-connected to public transportation, which is one of the most popular ways to get around New York City. Bensonhurst itself is an urban neighborhood, offering the hustle and bustle of the city. When exploring, you'll notice a plethora of Asian stores scattered throughout the area. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurst has seen a significant influx of Asian residents, resulting in an abundance of Asian-owned businesses - at least one per block. You'll likely find yourself surrounded by Asian-owned supermarkets and laundromats. These businesses are extremely popular among locals, offering top-notch food, affordable prices, and unparalleled convenience. I'm lucky enough to be close to four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walking distance from each other. This convenience makes accessing grocery shopping a breeze. While Bensonhurst isn't exclusively occupied by Asian residents, the area is culturally diverse, with immigrants and their children from various generations calling it home.\n\nMajority-owned businesses in the area are Asian-owned, but you'll also find a beautifully renovated park nearby, boasting over ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy in the summer. As you're in the heart of New York City, expect to see an array of diversity in the park, with people from all walks of life getting along harmoniously. Unlike other areas in the city, Bensonhurst doesn't have large corporate buildings; instead, you'll find co-op living spaces and condominium apartments. The majority of the living spaces are two-family houses. The locals are generally nice but can be a bit rowdy. Be prepared for loud cars blasting music as you walk by or people flooring their gas in the morning, which might wake you up. If you're planning a nighttime visit, be cautious - the neighborhood is generally safe, but you might encounter people looking for trouble or bullies. I've personally experienced bullying in the past, but it was a long time ago. More recently, there have been incidents of package theft. While it's a common issue elsewhere, package thieves do exist in Bensonhurst. One of my pet peeves is the lack of cleanliness in the neighborhood - specifically, dog waste everywhere. Be mindful of your surroundings, especially in the mornings, and keep your shoes clean!",
            "I live in a place with very limited sidewalks. Our house sits at the top of a steep hill in the neighborhood, which makes it a great spot for joggers to get a good workout. They often refer to it as the \"workout hill.\" Since there are no sidewalks on my street, everyone has to walk on the road, which can be a bit hazardous due to potholes and uneven surfaces. The telephone and electric wires surrounding my neighborhood are often in disrepair, with tattered-looking cables and patchwork repairs from frequent storm damage. We get a lot of rain and storms here, which causes branches and debris to fall on the power lines. \n\nThe area is surrounded by tall evergreen trees, but people around here aren't fans of them. They try to cut them down as much as possible because they block the view of the ocean. As a result, many houses are built high up on the hill with large glass windows to take in the view of the bay. It's beautiful during sunset when the water below is lit up and the sky turns orange. However, most days are overcast and cloudy, making it hard to see the sunlight clearly. Moss grows everywhere, from roofs to cars to railings, due to the constant dampness. I once left my car outside for a month, and when I returned, it was covered in moss and took me hours to clean off. The neighborhood is mostly made up of older residents, with many retirees. We don't have many kids around, but there's a school not far away. Instead of kids, we have a lot of dogs running around. They often sit in front of houses or chase each other down the street. If you leave a door or window open, they might sneak in. I once found one in my living room and had to shoo it out. Rabbits are also common in our area, and they can cause problems for gardeners by digging up plant roots and burrowing into lawns. However, my cats love them and have managed to hunt most of them out of our neighborhood. We also have a variety of birds, including small sparrows, hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle that gets chased off by the neighborhood crows. If you're willing to hike down to the waterfront, there are some restaurants that serve fresh seafood, but the beach itself is small and not very wide. You can still see the opposite shoreline clearly even on misty days.",
            "I live in a typical suburban area in a small town in the southern part of Tennessee. Our street is a connecting route between two state highways, resulting in a moderate amount of traffic, which I don't always enjoy. However, the neighborhood remains relatively quiet, with not too many people moving in and out. I've grown accustomed to the familiar faces that live around here. Most residents spend their days tending to their yards and other daily tasks. In the winter, we enjoy sledding down a nearby hill on our street. Our house, located at the corner of our street, allows us to see everyone passing by and become familiar with the vehicles that frequent our area. Whenever a stranger's car passes by, we tend to take notice. Some of our neighbors go for walks or take their dogs out for exercise. Kids can often be seen riding their bikes and engaging in typical neighborhood activities. Since we work from home, we're often at home, along with my wife and our two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen. As a result, everyone is used to seeing us come and go. We enjoy spending time outside, even on rainy days. Occasionally, we fire up the grill on our back deck, and the delicious smell of barbecue fills the air. The sounds of lawn mowers are a regular occurrence from March to October, when the grass growth slows down. Our neighborhood was originally a wooded area, so we have plenty of trees providing shade, but also a lot of leaves in the fall, which means raking and burning them every year. I enjoy the smell of burning leaves, marking the arrival of fall. Lately, we've been experiencing mild winters, making it feel like an extended fall season. Our garage is located at the back of our house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone knocks, which is a rare occurrence. I like tinkering with my truck or other projects in the garage, and when the doors are open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, the neighborhood is relatively quiet, with some families visiting from out of town during special occasions like Thanksgiving and Christmas. If it weren't a through street, I think our neighborhood would be perfect.",
            "I live in a neighborhood that's smack in the middle of the high desert, where the landscape is dominated by dirt and dust. Unless you've experienced living here, it's hard to grasp the feeling of seeing nothing but brown everywhere you look. It's not until you spot a lawn that you realize the owner must be breaking the bank to keep it looking that way. When I first moved here in the 90s, houses were spread out, but nowadays, it's pretty much the same, with some new additions popping up. The area is slowly transforming into a city, but I suppose that's a trend we see everywhere. On the plus side, the people here are generally friendly, though, just like any city, we have our good and bad sides. I'm surrounded by friendly, older folks, which makes it a nice neighborhood. The shopping scene is pretty basic, with just the usual chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you're looking for something upscale, you'll have to drive a bit. You won't find any Whole Foods or similar stores around here. The main industries in my city seem to be construction, which makes sense, given how undeveloped the area still is, with plenty of open spaces left to build on. That's a bit unsettling, but after living in a big city, I'm not eager to go back. My job is actually in the construction industry – I work as a drywall and T-bar installer. One thing I appreciate about my home is the diverse wildlife. People come to the high desert for its natural beauty, and it's home to unique ecosystems that need protecting. It's essential for human residents to learn about the non-human inhabitants of our environment to live in harmony. My family and I have adapted well to the local wildlife. My three kids are obsessed with lizards and desert bugs, and as I write this, they're outside trying to catch different specimens. As for attractions, we have a few. Victorville is a great place for families to experience the desert, and if you can, plan your visit to coincide with the annual San Bernardino County Fair. The fair offers a great mix of activities and fun in the Victorville style. If you head to nearby Wrightwood, you can see the snow-covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to cap off your visit. If you're interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem, the Victor Valley Museum is a great place to start. It features geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of Victorville's development and industry.",
            "When someone asks me to describe my neighbourhood, I'm pretty sure my answer would be quite unique. Unlike others who might be homeowners with their own life, my situation is a bit different. My neighbourhood is where I'm studying, and the people living in my dorm are like my community. The surrounding campus is part of my neighbourhood as well, but to a lesser extent. Although my neighbourhood is a bit unconventional, it shares some qualities with the typical idea of a neighbourhood. For instance, it has houses, people, shops and parks, just like any normal neighbourhood. Let's start with the \"houses\" that make up my neighbourhood. Before I dive into that, I should clarify the types of houses you can find around here. There are three types: apartments, houses, and dormitory houses. Firstly, the apartments usually have 2-4 people in each room, and there are 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type has about 2 floors, so there are around 20 people living in each building. Next, there are the houses that are available for rent, usually with 2-4 bedrooms. They're mostly occupied by alumni, but there aren't many of them around. Finally, there are the dorm rooms, where you'll find hundreds of students sharing rooms with one other person, except for a few exceptions. It's the most common type of housing in my neighbourhood. Now that we've covered the houses, let's talk about the people. My school values diversity, and it's reflected in my neighbourhood. People from all walks of life and different ages live here. The professional staff live in the houses, while the new students stay in the dorms and the older students in the apartments. Since my school is essentially a self-contained neighbourhood, it has plenty of shops and a single park. The shops offer a mix of food options and the school's own brands of clothing and groceries, so you can get anything you need without leaving. The park is a playground for everyone in the neighbourhood, kept clean and safe by all of us who live here.",
            "Well, after 10 years of living here, I think I can share my experiences with you. When I first moved to this neighborhood, I was pretty sad. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge with my family, and I have to admit, I cried because I missed my old home and friends. But my parents wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for a house, a better high school, and a more comfortable life. As time went by, I started to get used to the new place and made some new friends, but also encountered some not-so-friendly people in school. I didn't really get to know my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his family, and Dennis, who lived right next to us. They're wonderful people whom I consider as a kind of family, and I appreciate them greatly.\n\nI still remember when we went to Mr. Glen's wedding. It was a fun and memorable day, and I'm looking forward to experiencing something similar in the future when I settle down and give my future partner the life they deserve. When Mr. Glen's wife, Ms. Veda, removed her white strap and threw it, I managed to catch it, but unfortunately, I missed catching the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I enjoyed spending time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven't seen her since, but I hope she's doing well and pursuing her dreams.\n\nLiving in this neighborhood can be a bit confusing at times, but with the help of GPS, I've been able to explore it more. I've only ventured out with my friends Kason and Curtis so far, and we used to spend hours playing video games and enjoying life to the fullest. Sometimes I'd visit the park to connect with nature and find some peace. It's amazing how it can calm my mind and soothe my soul. I'd also bring sticks I bought from Home Depot and practice my balance, and sometimes I'd take my wooden sword, the bokken, with me. I love doing what I love and having fun.\n\nWe also have a basketball and tennis court in the neighborhood, although I haven't played tennis or basketball in a while. It's nice to have them available if I ever want to pick up the sport again. My dad taught me and my best friend to play tennis with Mr. Graves, and we always had a great time, even though they made us work hard. But that's what made it so enjoyable. I've had many wonderful experiences in this neighborhood, and there are more stories to share, but these are the ones that stand out to me, and I'm excited to see what the future holds.",
            "My place is literally just a stone's throw away from my college, which is why I'm so fond of living here. I have the luxury of living amidst apartment buildings, some cheap eateries, and a few bars that are fun to hang out at without burning a hole in my pocket. One of the bars just got a new name, and it's a bit pricier, but the quality of service and drinks are decent, and the people there are quite friendly. They're either students or low-income residents, considering the affordable apartment prices. There's a bunch of kids around since the nearby elementary school is within walking distance, but I don't really know my neighbors. They smoke a lot of weed, and the management of my building installed an air freshener right in front of their door, which my boyfriend and I found hilarious - it's almost like they're being mocked. The buildings around me are a bit old-looking, but maybe they've got renovated insides. A bit down the street, there are brand new apartments that look fancy, but I'm not a fan of them. They claim to be high-end but I'm pretty sure they're cheaply built, and the rent is way too steep. I think it's just a rip-off, but I guess since they're close to campus, the management can get away with it. There's a super cheap restaurant just about five minutes from my place that serves paper plates with mostly microwaved food. I also have a gas station right across from it, which, I've heard, isn't a great place to work. However, thanks to some city funds, the road was renovated last summer, and now we have a nice wide sidewalk, decent grass, and a more pleasant atmosphere. My apartment building is pretty shaded with trees, but the management cut a few down, leaving stumps behind. There are way more trees where I live compared to the other side of the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line, and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but just behind it is 43rd street, which isn't as nice. The sidewalks are all crumbled, and the buildings look shabby. There are a lot of trees there too, but I think they're just to hide the state of the buildings. Most of the crime in my area happens at an apartment complex on that street, but I'm not gonna blame just them - it's a problem that affects the whole area. There are apartments across the street from me that have their own share of crime and a rather transient population. Still, I like where I live. It's affordable, and there are plenty of useful amenities nearby, including the university and two bus stops that make it easy for me to get to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighbourhood is a quiet haven, composed of double-storey houses on a cul-de-sac. The homes are spaced out, giving the illusion of being individual houses. However, they all share the same distinct features - a vibrant yellow exterior, crisp white porches, and emerald green metal roofs. While most residents are friendly with one another, not everyone is acquaintances. We often gather at the end of a winding driveway in the evenings, engaging in casual conversations as the neighbourhood kids play with their toys, colour with sidewalk chalk, or fly their kites. It's a refreshing respite from the fast-paced, tech-obsessed world we live in, reminiscent of a bygone era. The scenery is picturesque - rolling fields, towering trees, and a brilliant blue sky dotted with puffy white clouds. Yet, Mother Nature can be unpredictable. This season, we've been plagued by tornado warnings, and for the first time, we heard the eerie sound of actual tornado sirens last night, prompting us to seek shelter. I found myself taking refuge in my bathtub, clutching my smallest dog and essentials, while my bigger dog remained in the living room, anxious and barking. The neighbourhood was eerily quiet, except for the deafening sound of large hail pounding the ground. As the storm passed, the temperature plummeted from 92 to 75 degrees in a matter of minutes. The hail instantly melted upon hitting the scorching pavement. As the skies cleared, the sun peeked through, and a double rainbow appeared. I quickly grabbed my camera to capture the breathtaking scene, eager to share it with my friends and family on Facebook. They, like me, were amazed by the spectacle. The streets remained deserted for another hour before people began returning home from wherever they were when the storm struck. Once again, life returned to normal - dinner was cooking, and mothers and children were outside enjoying the evening. As a transplant from New Hampshire to North Carolina, I've grown fond of the region's distinct southern drawl. My two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment, like everyone else's, may look identical from the outside, but each has its unique character inside. Some are surprisingly compact, leaving me perplexed. I cherish strolling through the expansive field behind my home, making my way to the pond, which, unfortunately, isn't suitable for swimming. I've spotted deer and, in the mornings, I'm serenaded by the deep, melodic song of the giant bullfrog. It's a fantastic place to call home, situated just 40 minutes from the bustling city of Charlotte. Each morning begins with the cheerful sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms, giving our neighbourhood a village-like atmosphere. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that brays in the evening, letting us know he's still there. I feel fortunate to have discovered this hidden gem of a neighbourhood.",
            "It was during my 8th grade year when I moved into this neighbourhood. It took me a while to make friends, but I eventually became close with two guys, one who lives just two houses down and another on the same street. Although neither of them lives here anymore, the memories we made together still linger. The people who were here when I first arrived are still here, for the most part. My neighbourhood is pretty much like any other American suburb. There are plenty of two-storey houses, and on warm days, I can hear the kids playing outside every weekend. Most days are quiet, but you're never left on your own unless you need help. I've ordered several packages online without any issues, and my neighbours are trustworthy. Just a minute or two away from my house is a park where I've spent many happy times. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there with my friends, and it's also where I got one of my worst injuries - a nasty elbow to the nose while playing football. However, the good memories far outweigh the bad. These days, I visit the park with my cousin's kids. They're still young and love playing on the swings and slides. The thought of going to the park always brings back a flood of memories. The neighbourhood is quite diverse, and you can find all sorts of food nearby. Within a one-mile radius, there are Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants, although many people now prefer ordering food through apps like GrubHub and DoorDash. The most popular places are fast food shops, but you can find those just about anywhere. There are also many pizza places. The stores here have everything you could ever need, including multiple dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is a staple in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even run by Indians, catering to those who want to cook homemade Indian food or buy ready-made dishes. All in all, I'm a big fan of my neighbourhood. Seeing the horror stories on social media and news about people's experiences with their neighbours makes me grateful for the ones I have.",
            "My hometown of Johnston is a charming little place that doesn't stand out from the rest of the towns in South Carolina, but it holds a significant influence in the agricultural sector. It proudly claims to be the Peach Capital of the World, a title showcased on the welcoming sign at the town's entrance. The landscape is mainly dominated by vast farmlands of either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't situated in the town center are spaced out, with most being two-story homes featuring metal roofs to combat the scorching summer heat or gray shingles. These homes are often situated away from the main road, allowing for the front fields to be used for farming. In the town center, there's only one traffic light at a four-way intersection. It's here that you'll find the town's few stores. There are three options for quick bites: Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. A pizzeria used to be in operation, but it closed down a while ago. Maxwell and Halford Drug is a small family-owned pharmacy that's surprisingly famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola. Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA for short, is a small and pricey grocery store that's the town's only option. While it's the main grocery store, many residents prefer to travel to the Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville to buy most of their groceries. The most popular store in town, though, is Dollar General, which sells a wide variety of everyday essentials and is always bustling from opening to closing. There's also a small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind community figure who employs two movers to deliver purchased items. Right next door is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a small pet grooming service that offers various services like daycare, boarding, grooming, and more. Both the doctor's office and veterinary clinic are located outside the town center, but they're well-equipped to serve the town's residents. We have a single elementary school, Johnston Elementary School, which serves students up to fifth grade. After that, students move on to middle and high school in the neighboring town. Although there aren't any parks within the town, a new 2.5-acre recreational area is currently under construction to provide families with more opportunities for outings and attract new visitors or residents. Despite its limited attractions, Johnston is a nice place that's so small you could drive right by without even noticing it.",
            "The first time I heard about my place, it was while listening to a podcast about people who went missing. It left a surprising impression on me. Almost every apartment in the area was renting for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story before, and my friends hadn't either. It made me think about the struggles we all face. I know some of my friends struggle to sleep at night because of the costs. Things are expensive, but over time, we've learned to be thrifty. You start to accept the dusty smell of flea market items and worn-out clothes. You notice you smell less in adulthood. You might start smoking or become accustomed to the way things are. However, the flea market always manages to assert itself. The smell of adulthood is the musty smell of old magazines on an old piano, which even washing the piano can't remove. Here, there're three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can visit two charity stores, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curio shop. Downtown is crowded, with cars and people filling the streets every morning, but inside the thrift stores, you'll find silence. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store remains quiet. It's a nice place to spend an afternoon. Every year, the area gets busier, with more cars and people flooding the streets. It's a developing city, they say. As one of the largest e-commerce and delivery empires is headquartered here, it's still dealing with growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone's focused on their goals, and nobody really asks for much. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's different from the South, where showing a little concern means you care. You don't pry into people's lives here; you can keep your shell as long as you like, and the city will move along like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. There's always something going on, whether it's the pianist next door or the two amateur singers upstairs. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. I feel fortunate to live here. I quite like my neighbors, and they treat me well. I try to keep my apartment clean and leave food for them, and they do the same for me. I bring their mail, and they bring mine. It's nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my presence just as much as I do theirs. Despite living in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl, it's my neighbors who make me feel like I haven't ruined my life completely.",
            "My neighborhood is a pretty standard suburban area, with a strong presence of a homeowner's association that maintains the look and feel of the place. As soon as you step in, you'll notice the neatly kept single-family homes, all thanks to the HOA. Every house has a similar front yard with a patch of grass, decorative pebbles, and short driveways. Small trees are scattered around, and everyone has a two-car garage. The roads are also well-maintained, with newly paved concrete and no potholes in sight. The houses are mostly one story, but some have two stories as well. Instead of individual mailboxes, we have a system of shared mailboxes at the end of the street, which requires a key to access. There are also two large lockers for packages - another testament to the HOA's focus on uniformity. Our neighborhood is situated on the outskirts of the nearby city, giving us a mix of rural and suburban vibes. We have plenty of land for everything, including multiple community pools that are well-maintained and gated, and walking trails where you can take your dog or enjoy a peaceful evening stroll. Since most of the community is made up of retired folks, it's a very safe area where everyone looks out for each other. We also have a smaller number of middle-aged and young professionals living here. The nearby city is surprisingly large in terms of population, but it feels like a small town. We have all the amenities you'd expect, including a mall that's not too big but gets the job done. It takes around 15 minutes to drive to significant places, but once you get there, you'll find a variety of stores to choose from, ranging from high-end grocery stores to bargain outlets. Overall, my neighborhood is a safe, well-maintained, and pretty standard place to live, with plenty of nice features like pools and walking trails.",
            "Yesterday, I thought to myself, I really love my little Midwestern town, nestled just outside a bustling city. It's not fancy, but it's home. Our neighborhood on the east side is indeed the most economically challenged area in town, with property values being relatively low. People own or rent houses here, but that's just the way it is. Don't get me wrong, it's not ugly or unpleasant. Everyone in my neighborhood is super friendly. They greet me warmly when I stroll down the street, and we all have a good time chatting. Of course, there's a slightly higher crime rate compared to other parts of town, but we've been lucky so far. I mean, there have been some instances of violence in the past decade, but fortunately, we haven't been directly affected. Our neighbors' son lost his life in a shooting near the local watering hole last year, but we've been fortunate enough to avoid any serious issues like that. The only time we've been affected by crime was when we forgot to bring something inside, and it went missing from our porch. Our town is one of those places that has been hit hard by the opioid epidemic that's sweeping across America. Sadly, many lives have been lost to fentanyl overdoses, but we're fortunate to have plenty of resources to help combat this issue. There are several addiction rehab centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those struggling with addiction.\n\nDespite all this, our town has its bright spots. My son's elementary school is top-notch, with amazing staff from the principal to the teachers and support staff. He's got special needs, but he's never been bullied due to the incredibly positive vibe at school. He loves going there. We have a very active PTO that organizes loads of events throughout the year to get families involved and promote educational progress. Since over 20% of our town's population lives below the poverty line, the school offers free breakfast and lunch to every student, so no child ever goes hungry. No one is looked down upon because they can't pay, and school fees, supplies, and field trips are super reasonable. The City Council and staff have made some great improvements to our town, like fixing roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these upgrades have happened in the center of town and on the west side, where the shopping areas are and most of the traffic passes through. Our side of town tends to get a bit neglected, which is a point of contention for us.\n\nAll in all, I really enjoy living here. People are friendly, the schools are great, and there are plenty of shopping options to meet our needs. Our home might not be worth much, but it's cozy and comfortable. We've been living here for over 16 years, and we can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is a melting pot of diverse cultures, nestled on a hill overlooking a tapestry of historic buildings. I reside in a 7-story apartment complex directly opposite the old theater, with a vibrant arcade bar a short stroll away. This popular hotspot draws in people from all walks of life on warm summer evenings, with long queues forming outside on weekends in June and July. Just a few blocks away lies the local city park, a significant green oasis in the midst of our bustling town. The park is encircled by concrete walls with stairs carved into the structure, providing a cozy abode for the homeless during the cold winter months. They huddle together in neat rows, sheltered from the rain and wind, yet still within walking distance of the local family center where they can access basic amenities like showers and bathing facilities.\n\nWhat I cherish about my neighborhood, however, isn't the grand architecture or the historic charm – it's the people themselves. You see, Hilltop was once notorious for gang violence, and the scars still linger. Even decades later, whispers of federal intervention and DEA crackdowns still circulate among the locals. The community has worked tirelessly to maintain their neighborhood's cleanliness, despite its reputation as one of the rougher areas in the city. They care deeply about their community and its well-being, passing down stories of the past to newcomers like me. A warning often shared among outsiders is that it's not safe to walk the Hill at night if you're white, a stigma that still lingers from the past. I believe this cautionary tale is a product of social conditioning, tainted with the bitter taste of racism and ignorance. Perhaps it's because I've grown accustomed to navigating these complexities, or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of their own – someone who understands the lingering remnants of societal prejudice. Whatever the reason, I know one thing: the Hilltop will always be my home. I feel most alive walking its streets at night, surrounded by people who've offered me kindness and compassion, rather than malice. It's a place where laundromat owners stay open late to help a lost soul, where strangers offer you a jacket on a cold night, and where you're reminded of your worth and beauty in a world that often tries to erase it.",
            "I'm living in Rural America, in the heart of a small town in Michigan. My place is surrounded by farmland and quaint tourist spots, with no massive city malls or big-name stores like Wal-mart, Target, or Applebee's. You need a car to get around here. Despite that, I'm blessed to live in one of the most beautiful spots on earth, flanked by the stunning Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. My hometown is literally surrounded by water, with beaches waiting to be explored. The neighborhood I live in reflects the charm of small-town life. Houses aren't stacked on top of each other like skyscrapers; they're unique, older homes that have been lovingly updated or remodeled over the years. Many of them have basements that can be seen from the road, giving them a cozy, welcoming feel. My neighborhood is a rainbow of colors, with houses sporting every hue imaginable, each one standing out in its own way. Most of these homes have spacious yards, complete with trampolines, playsets, and sometimes even gardens and animal enclosures. It's a quintessential Middle America feel, where families work hard to make a living and raise their kids. On any given day, you'll see kids running up and down the streets, people strolling with their dogs, biking, or rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors, and you can easily spot who fits in and who's a new face. You might catch someone grilling in their yard and wave, or see someone walking their dog from a few blocks away and smile in greeting. The lawns are well-maintained, with neatly trimmed grass and tidy gardens. It's not a picturesque neighborhood that'll leave you awestruck, but it's a place where you'd feel comfortable raising a family. It's quiet, peaceful, and safe. Within walking distance, you'll find the county sheriff's department and jail, the health department, and the local recycling center. We even have baseball and softball fields nearby, where you can hear the announcers calling out the scores and player names. The small-town airport is just a stone's throw away, and you can hear the rumble of small planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream at the local parlor or bike to the nearby park, which is just a short 8 blocks away. It's a fantastic place to call home."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "Living in a big city, my neighborhood is super diverse. Houses and offices are scattered all over the place, next to each other, as if randomly placed. Some buildings are huge, well-known brands, but there are also small boutiques that are gaining popularity. They're not just found in malls, but also along the streets, which are often within walking distance of quiet neighborhoods. There are also a few parks nearby, and I've noticed that people take their little ones there often. As for the people, my neighborhood is really mixed - there's a big LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a bunch of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union all living in one small area. If you go a bit further out, there are even more people from all sorts of different backgrounds, but they're often grouped together in their own little communities within the city. We have places like Koreatown, Chinatown, and Little Armenia, all just a few miles away. However, driving that short distance can take a long time due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Nobody really walks much in my city, though - even though some cool spots are close by, the city is huge, and people don't like to walk. As a result, our traffic is crazy, and finding a parking spot is almost impossible. It's ironic that the city has been getting a lot of new construction, with big apartment buildings popping up everywhere. But many residents are not happy about it, as it means more people and more cars on the roads. My neighborhood has all sorts of houses, not just big apartment buildings. There are single-family homes, smaller apartments, and condos, all mixed together. Even within my immediate neighborhood, there's a wide range of housing options. The neighborhood is also made up of people of all ages, and I'm not really close to most of my neighbors. It's not like a close-knit community anymore, but I do have fond memories of playing with my next-door neighbor and a few other friends when I was younger.",
            "My neighbourhood has this unique charm. Most of the houses are single-family homes, but there are a few that have been split, yet still connected, if you get what I mean. My home has a small front yard and a driveway to the left. It reminds me of the good old days when the American dream was all about living in the suburbs. This dream, which once seemed to capture the hearts of this nation, is slowly fading away. Yet, my neighbourhood and many others like it still stand as a testament to the dream's enduring spirit. The people living here don't feel as optimistic as they used to, and the upkeep of the yards isn't what it was, but there's still a car or two parked in every driveway, and kids are still playing as if their world is the only one that matters. The old public school, which has been here for almost 90 years, still stands tall, inspiring the youth and evoking nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are scarce, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are always bustling. Although each house looks different, they all feel the same. We have a large supermarket called Super \"A\" run by a big Yemeni family, who are possibly the only Arab family in the neighbourhood. Most residents are African American. The streets are wide, and kids usually play football, only stopping to let cars pass. Many people in my neighbourhood have lived here for generations, and most have stories to share about a time when everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school, but after the karate kid movies stopped, the kids lost interest, so it's now a pharmacy. They say drugs can fix everything. There's also a small movie theatre that shows old movies at a discounted price, avoided by the youth for its outdated titles, but cherished by the elders who think it's worth a night out without the kids. We have an expressway that passes through our town, but the entrance and exit are actually in the next town over. There was a petition to get an exit for our town, but the youth supported it, while the elders opposed it, fearing it would ruin our town. So, they convinced the city council to reject the request. We're building a new high school, and we're trying to decide on a mascot for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the perfect representation of our town.",
            "At first glance, it's easy to overlook this place - it seems like a typical residential area behind a shopping strip, not really a neighborhood one would expect to find homes in. But if you walk behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and head towards the hotels that are only used for annual visits, aside from the occasional summer get-togethers, you'll stumble upon a thriving community. Among these communities are a series of apartment complexes, carefully arranged side by side like Russian nesting dolls that have been taken apart and placed in line along the road. \n\nWhile the apartments at the beginning of the row have gotten some bad press, we'll focus on the others. The ones next to those complexes, and the ones next to that, reveal a completely different world that's rarely known to locals. A community college's satellite campus is situated across from these complexes, its quiet, sleepy buildings standing guard beside the road. Students start their days with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning as they head to class. The entrance gates creak open one at a time, causing some morning commuters to groan in frustration.\n\nA residential road intersects with the main road, flanked by a park and a rehabilitation center for people with broken bones. The treatment center boasts a cheerful porch area, and a lazily spinning ceiling fan that stirs the warm summer air. Children play in the park across the street, laughing and spinning around in the grass while bees buzz lazily in the nearby flower patches. Retirees walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on skateboards and nodding politely at the teenage girls chatting by the playground equipment. There's a sushi place in a nearby strip mall with affordable food, a swimming supply store right next door, and a nail salon nestled in between. You can get your pool filled for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken - a true strip mall experience. A frozen yogurt shop is also nearby, where teens often grab a cold treat while showing off their skateboarding skills and vaping because they think it's the coolest.\n\nThis neighborhood is a quintessential piece of American history, a small town in the south where time seems to stand still and nothing much changes.",
            "We were driving through an endless expanse of cornfields as she gazed out at the horizon in awe. \"Where are we?\" she asked, taken aback by the vast open space. I chuckled, knowing she'd be shocked by the stark contrast to her hometown where the grocery store was just a stone's throw away. I shared with her what it was like growing up in rural Ohio, where the cornfields stretched as far as the eye could see. In that moment, she finally got a glimpse of who I was and where I came from.\n\nAs we drove down the winding country road, the landscape gave way to a quarry filled with water, and then a small development that was home. The houses were a mix of brick and stucco, each one sprawling across at least half an acre of land that everyone took pride in keeping immaculate. In the spring, flowers bloomed alongside the midwestern trees that changed with the seasons, and the driveways were lined with sleek Mercedes-Benz luxury cars that glistened in the sunlight after a good wash.\n\nAs we turned onto my street, my neighbour, a friendly Korean man, was always outside, tending to his lawn with a song in his heart. He'd spend the entire day mowing, his voice blending in with the hum of his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Everyone in the neighbourhood loved him for his genuine nature and the unique stories he had to share. Though he'd lost some of his wit with age, he was still an amazing person who'd lived a life full of adventure as a doctor.\n\nMy home came into view, and in the side yard, geese waddled about, chased by our mischievous Terrier. Behind the house, a small stream flowed into the quarry, where the sounds of bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional \"moo\" from the nearby farms created a soothing melody. On the other side of the handmade wooden bridge lay a hidden oasis teeming with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. It was my childhood playground, where I spent my days building tree forts, \"hunting\" imaginary prey, and making friends with the kids from the neighbourhood. The winters were harsh, but there was something magical about it. The yard would transform from a lush green to a barren wilderness, and the trees that once bloomed with vibrant flowers would stand as skeletal sentinels of bark. And when snow fell, a winter wonderland would appear overnight, complete with snow angels and snowmen crafted by my little sister. We'd engage in fierce snowball fights, building massive forts to house our arsenal of branches. It was our own little world, where nothing else mattered, and we were just carefree kids.",
            "First off, to truly grasp the essence of Portland, Oregon, one must understand the meaning behind \"weird\". The phrase, which adorns a building that serves multiple purposes like a pizza joint, bar, music venue, and more, is an unofficial town slogan that goes by \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, it's a nostalgic call to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's - a time when the city was less known and less crowded, fostering unique and creative subcultures. To others, it's an invitation to visit a place where being called \"weird\" is considered a badge of honor.\n\nDespite the influx of affluent Californians and the rise of condominiums, Portland still maintains its offbeat charm. Being \"weird\" in Portland doesn't necessarily mean accepting anything, but rather embracing differences that are often shunned by society. We're not immune to modern conveniences and conflicts like the rest of the country, as we import most of our goods from China. However, there are countless ways to be \"weird\" or \"not normal\" in Portland, and we have our fair share of normalcy too. You'll find yoga enthusiasts, hipsters, and business professionals living alongside the rest of us.\n\nPerhaps what makes Portland truly \"weird\" is that we don't take ourselves too seriously. In my neighborhood, like many others, you'll spot colorful houses, vibrant home gardens, and free boxes lining the streets during the summer months. Free boxes typically contain items people are getting rid of, but they can be anything from clothes and books to unexpected treasures. The thrill of discovering something valuable in a free box is a big part of what makes Portland special, and it's a feeling that's unique to each neighborhood in the city.\n\nPortland has its quirkiness, and I'm just one example of the many weird and wonderful residents here. Some people I live among wouldn't dream of rummaging through boxes on the sidewalk, opting instead for activities like goat yoga or cheering on the city's soccer team at a Timbers match. What I love about Portland is its diversity - people here pursue their passions, whether it's starting a business, playing music, or simply enjoying a cold beer at the bar.\n\nOf course, like any city, Portland has its problems. We struggle with a drug issue that often stems from underlying mental health issues, and the constant rain doesn't help. We also have a homelessness problem that's a challenge to solve, with services that are insufficient but still better than in many other parts of the country. The non-homeless population is torn between feeling empathy and frustration towards the homeless. In this regard, Portland is not so \"weird\" after all.",
            "The mountains stand tall, a constant presence in the north, silently witnessing the passage of time as the sun rises and sets each day. Irrespective of how engrossed I am in work or life, they persist, unyielding to the ebbs and flows of life's turmoil. On days when I'm overwhelmed with stress and anxiety, they beckon me, and when I turn to them, they offer a respite, lending me the strength to carry on, one day at a time. It was during my undergraduate days that I first discovered their allure. While the university campus boasts its own share of breathtaking views, the mountains that lie to the north of the campus have an enduring hold on my heart. The university's charm, with its beautiful buildings, ponds, and trees, has won a part of my affection, but it's the mountains that hold the top spot. The rest of the town is equally captivating, with its array of quaint cafés where I spent countless hours fueled by caffeine and determination. A short walk or bus ride takes you to the downtown area, where the faded brick facades transport you to a bygone era, infusing the air with an aura of antiquity. Amidst this blend of suburban tranquility and urban vigor, the town presents a unique charm, an invitation to explore. The juxtaposition of these contrasting atmospheres within close proximity creates a captivating essence, as if beckoning me to uncover its secrets. With time, I've accumulated numerous cherished memories, each tied to a specific part of town, whether it's walking past the rusted swings in the park after a sleepless night with friends or racing through the bustling downtown to catch a movie that the university had provided tickets for. Alas, life has also bestowed upon me numerous harsh memories, a universal aspect of our experiences. The ponds, in particular, have come to serve as a poignant reminder of my introspective moments, as well as the many tears I've shed in the dead of night, grappling with existential crises. While watching the turtles, ducks, and insects live their lives, each with a role to play, I couldn't help but ponder my own purpose as I navigated the complexities of life. As I strolled past the pond, the park, and the quaint houses that epitomize suburban life, I eventually reached the main street, where the sun's rays danced across the palm trees, casting a kaleidoscope of colors across the sky. In that moment, as I gazed up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. And there they were – the mountains, steadfast and resolute, their presence speaking volumes, stirring within me a sense of resilience.",
            "Bensonhurst, Brooklyn - it's no secret that finding your way here is a breeze, thanks to the excellent public transportation system that's as accessible as it is convenient. As one of New York City's most popular forms of transportation, you'll find it easy to get around. With Bensonhurst being a bustling urban neighborhood, you'll still get that quintessential NYC vibe. During your visit, get ready to be surrounded by the numerous Asian stores that seem to be on every corner. It's no coincidence that this neighborhood has become a hub for Asian inhabitants over the past two decades, which is reflected in the abundance of Asian-owned stores. Supermarkets and laundromats are the most popular, and for good reason - they offer top-notch food, unbeatable prices, and unparalleled convenience. Just a stone's throw away from where I am, there are no less than four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walking distance from each other, making grocery shopping a total cinch.\n\nDon't get me wrong, Bensonhurst isn't a sea of Asian faces - it's a melting pot of cultures, with immigrants and their American-born children calling the neighborhood home. The majority of local businesses are still Asian-owned, though, and it's not uncommon to see families and friends of all ages enjoying the vibrant atmosphere. Just a short walk away, you'll find a newly renovated park that's a gem of the neighborhood. With ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for the summer months, there's something for everyone. As you'd expect in New York City, the park is a haven for diversity, and people of all ages and backgrounds come together to play and socialize.\n\nIn terms of housing, you won't find any large corporate buildings here - instead, co-op living and condominium apartments are the norm, with most residents calling two-family houses home. While the majority of people are friendly and welcoming, be prepared for some noise pollution. You'll often hear cars blasting their music, or people flooring it down the road, which can be a bit jarring. If you're visiting at night, it's a good idea to keep your wits about you - while Bensonhurst is generally a safe neighborhood, you never know when you might encounter someone looking for trouble. I've had my own run-ins with bullies and package thieves, but these incidents were a while back. Just remember to keep your shoes clean and be mindful of your surroundings!",
            "My home is nestled at the top of a steep hill, and I'm surrounded by a neighborhood with a unique landscape. People often call it the \"workout hill\" because joggers love to tackle the incline. Since there are no sidewalks, everyone walks on the road, which is a bit hazardous with its potholes and uneven surface. The street's lined with worn-out telephone and electric wires, which are frequently damaged by falling branches and debris from the many storms we get. Evergreen trees abound, but surprisingly, most people here dislike them, as they obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many houses are built high up on the hill, with large glass windows to take in the stunning view of the bay. Watching the sunset is breathtaking, with the water glowing from below and the sky turning orange. However, it's often cloudy, so the sunlight's filtered through a haze. The atmosphere's usually overcast and damp, which contributes to the lush growth of moss on everything – roofs, cars, and even railings. I once left my car in the driveway for a month, and when I returned, it was covered in a thick layer of moss that took me three hours to scrub off. Our neighborhood's relatively quiet, with only a few kids around, thanks to a school nearby. The majority of residents are retired folks, and instead of kids, we have plenty of dogs roaming around. It's not uncommon to see them lounging in people's lawns or racing down the street. If you leave a door or window open, they might sneak in, like when I once found one lounging in my living room and had to shoo it out. Rabbits are also abundant, and they love to dig up plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats have helped keep them under control, though. We also have a variety of birds, including small sparrows and hummingbirds, and occasionally, a hawk or eagle will swoop by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. While we don't have any stores nearby, a short hike down to the waterfront leads to a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. The beach itself isn't extensive, but the rocks along the shore make for fun skipping stones into the water. On most days, you can see the opposite shoreline clearly through the mist.",
            "I've been living in a typical suburban area in a small town in Tennessee for a while now. Our street is situated between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic than I'd like, but other than that, it's a pretty quiet neighborhood. We're not used to having many new faces around here, so I've gotten to know most of the regulars. Folks usually spend their time tending to their lawns and daily chores. In the winter, we enjoy sledding down the hill on our side street. Since we live in a house at the corner of our street, we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that roll through here. Whenever we spot a strange vehicle, we tend to take notice. Some of the neighbors like to take a stroll for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids are always out on their bikes, and you can hear the usual sounds of a small town. As we work from home, we're mostly at home, along with my wife and our two daughters, ages eleven and fourteen. So, it's no surprise that everyone else is used to seeing us come and go. We enjoy spending time outdoors, even when it's raining, and sometimes we fire up the grill on our back deck, filling the air with the delicious smell of barbecue. You can almost always hear the sound of lawn mowers from March to October, when the grass finally stops growing. Our neighborhood used to be wooded, so there are plenty of trees providing shade, but that also means raking and burning leaves every year in the Fall. I must admit, the smell of burning leaves is one of my favorites – it's a sure sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not had much of a Winter, so it feels like it's been one long Fall. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone knocks on the door, which is a rare occurrence. I like to tinker with my truck or other projects in the garage, and when the doors are open, it feels like I'm more connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, things are pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving and other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas bring some extra visitors, and you can spot more cars parked along the street. All in all, I'm quite happy living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "Yesterday, I found myself pondering about my neighborhood, situated smack dab in the middle of the high desert. The endless expanse of brown dirt stretches out before me, a constant reminder of the harsh yet beautiful environment I call home. Unless you've experienced living here firsthand, it's hard to comprehend the monotony of gazing out at the same dull landscape day in and day out. But when you do chance upon a well-manicured lawn, you know that person has invested a small fortune in lawn care. I've lived in this area since the 90s, and although the houses have sprouted up around me, the layout still feels largely the same. In fact, it's a bit eerie how much this place resembles a city, yet, like many other places, it's undergoing rapid transformation. The locals are generally friendly, but, just like any city, there's a mix of the good and the not-so-good. I'm surrounded by friendly elderly folks, which makes my neighborhood feel like a nicer community. The local stores are mostly chain stores, like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final, but if you're looking for upscale options, you're better off traveling elsewhere. I rarely see any Whole Foods or boutiques around here. The dominant industries in my city appear to be construction, given its relatively underdeveloped state and the abundance of open spaces waiting to be built upon. This thought unsettles me, as I prefer things the way they are now. I left behind a big city and don't fancy going back. My full-time job is in the construction field, specifically as a drywall and T-bar installer, which means I'm somewhat invested in its growth. What I appreciate about my home, however, is the unique wildlife. People flock to the high desert for its breathtaking beauty, and the challenging ecosystems it supports have created an opportunity for various species to thrive. It's essential for human residents to learn about and respect the non-human inhabitants of this environment to coexist peacefully. My family and I have adapted well to the wildlife, and my kids are particularly fascinated by lizards and desert bugs. As I write this, they're outside, trying to catch different specimens. As for attractions, we have a few gems. Victorville is a great destination for families looking to experience the desert, and if you plan your visit to coincide with the annual San Bernardino County Fair, you'll have a fantastic time. The fair offers an excellent mix of activities and fun, showcasing the Victorville way. If you're looking for a winter sports fix, head over to Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and take a lesson or two. Lastly, the Victor Valley Museum is a treasure trove of geological, paleontological, and Native American artifacts that provide valuable insights into the history and development of the high desert ecosystem.",
            "My neighborhood might sound like everyone else's, but trust me, it's unique. Unlike others who probably live in their own individual houses, I consider my neighborhood to be the campus I'm on and the people in my dormitory as my community. The surrounding campus is part of my neighborhood too, although it's not as central as the dorm. Despite being a bit unusual, my neighborhood shares some familiar traits with the typical idea of a neighborhood. Just like any normal neighborhood, it's got houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's dive into the 'houses' that make up my neighborhood. Before I do, I need to clarify the types of houses we have here. There are three kinds: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory houses. Apartments usually have 2-4 people in each room, with 4-6 rooms per floor, and about 20 people in each building. The actual houses are a bit rare, with 2-4 bedrooms, mostly occupied by alumni. Then there are the dorm rooms, where hundreds of students live, with each room housing 2 people, except in some cases. They're the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. Now, let's talk about the people. My school is proud of its diversity, and it shows in the neighborhood. You'll find people from all cultures and ages here. Professionals usually live in the houses, while new students are in dorms, and older students are in apartments. We can't do the people justice, so let's move on to the stores and park. Since my school is a mini-neighborhood, it has plenty of stores and a single park. The stores offer a mix of dining options and the school's unique brand of clothes and groceries. You can find anything you need within our neighborhood's boundaries. The park is our playground, kept clean and safe by everyone in the community.",
            "I've been living in this neighborhood for about 10 years now, so I guess it's time for me to share some stories about it. When I first moved here from Riverdale to Stockbridge, I was pretty sad because I missed my old home and the people I loved. My mom and dad made the tough decision to move us to a better neighborhood for a better life, a better school, and a safer environment. It wasn't easy, but I eventually got used to it and made some new friends, as well as some new enemies in school. To be honest, I never really got to know my neighbors that well, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and to a lesser extent, Dennis, who lived right next door. They've been like a family to me, and I feel grateful for having them in my life. I remember attending Mr. Glen's wedding, which was a great experience, and something I hope to replicate in my own life someday. When Ms. Veda threw off her prosthetic leg strap during the wedding, I managed to catch it, but unfortunately not the flowers. We danced the night away, and I had a blast with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I've lost touch with her since, but I hope she's doing well. The neighborhood can be confusing, but now that I have a GPS, I've been exploring it more. I've hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis a few times, and we used to spend hours playing video games and enjoying life. I also love visiting the park and appreciating nature, which helps me feel more calm and at peace. I often take sticks from Home Depot and practice my balance, and I enjoy wielding my bokken wooden sword. There are also a basketball and tennis court nearby, although I haven't played either sport in a while. My dad used to coach me and my best friend in tennis with Mr. Graves, and those were some of the best times. They pushed us hard, but we always had fun. Looking back, I've had a lot of fun in this neighborhood, and there are plenty of stories I could share, but these are the ones that stand out to me. I'm excited to see what the future holds.",
            "I'm really lucky to be living near the college I attend, and I think that's one of the best things about where I live. My neighborhood is pretty chill, with mostly apartment buildings and a few fun, affordable bars and restaurants to hang out at. One of the bars has just changed its name, but it's still not too pricey and the service and drinks are alright. Most of the people around here are either students or lower-income folks who can afford the apartments, which is pretty cool. You can hear the sound of kids playing since there's an elementary school nearby, within walking distance of my place. To be honest, I don't really know my neighbors - they're a bit too into smoking weed, and the management installed an air freshener unit right outside their door, which my boyfriend and I thought was pretty funny. It's almost like they're trying to send a message. The buildings around me are a bit old-fashioned, but they might have been renovated on the inside. Down the street, there are brand new apartments, but I'm not a fan - they're super cheaply built but the rent is way too high, which I think is just taking advantage of people. Since they're close to campus, though, the management gets away with it. There's this one super cheap eatery about a 5-minute walk from my place that only serves food on paper plates and most of their dishes are microwaved. Across from that is a gas station that's not exactly the best place to work. But thanks to some city funding, they redid the road last summer, so now we have a nice big sidewalk, some grass on the median and the sides, and the area looks a lot nicer. The apartment building I live in has a lot of trees around it, but they cut some down, so now there are a few stumps left. There are way more trees where I live than down the street. Behind my apartment complex is a line of trees and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street, which isn't as nice. The sidewalks are in bad shape and the buildings look pretty shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but I think they're just trying to hide the state of the buildings. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but I don't blame them entirely - there are other apartments across the street with their own problems and a pretty transient population. Despite all this, I really like where I live. It's affordable, and there are plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially love that the university is within walking distance, and there are two bus stops so I can easily get to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood is a haven of colorful duplexes nestled in a cul-de-sac. The houses are spread out in a way that makes them seem like individual homes, with only one notable difference - each one is painted a cheerful yellow, adorned with white porches and green metal roofs. While not everyone is close friends, there's a sense of camaraderie that permeates the air. On some evenings, you'll find us gathered at the end of a driveway, chatting and laughing as the kids play with their toys, sidewalk chalk, or fly their kites. It's a refreshing escape from the hustle and bustle of the modern world, a step back in time when life was simpler. The surrounding fields and trees are a stunning backdrop, set against a brilliant blue sky with puffy white clouds. However, this season has brought a new challenge - tornado warnings, which recently culminated in our first-ever experience of actual sirens blaring, prompting us to seek shelter. I was huddled in my bathtub with my smallest dog and some essentials, while my bigger dog stayed put in the living room, anxious and barking. The neighborhood was eerily quiet, except for the sound of large hail pounding the ground. After the storm, the temperature dropped dramatically, and the road was suddenly steaming hot. The hail melted instantly on the pavement as the sun broke through the clearing skies and a double rainbow appeared. I dashed inside to grab my camera and snapped some pictures to share with my friends and family on Facebook - they were as amazed as I was. It took about an hour for the streets to return to normal, and soon the familiar sounds of mom's cooking and children's laughter filled the air. I've grown to love this friendly community, especially the warm Southern accents that fill the air. My two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment is just like everyone else's on the outside, but each one has its unique character on the inside. It's puzzling why some apartments are so small, but it's a minor quirk in an otherwise idyllic setting. I adore strolling through the vast field behind my home, meandering down to the pond that's not meant for swimming. I've spotted deer and even heard the majestic bullfrog's morning serenade. It's a fantastic place to live, just a 40-minute drive from the city of Charlotte. Every morning begins with the cheerful sound of roosters crowing from the nearby farms, creating a sense of community that's hard to find in the city. We even have a friendly donkey at a nearby farm that brays in the evening, reminding us of its presence. I feel lucky to have discovered this hidden gem of a neighborhood.",
            "I stepped into my new neighborhood just as I was about to enter the world of eighth grade. At first, it was tough to connect with the locals, but fate had other plans, and I formed a bond with a guy living right next door and another fellow on my street. Although they're no longer around, the memories remain vivid. The people who were here when I first arrived are still here, giving our neighborhood a sense of continuity. Our neighborhood is just like any other American suburban neighborhood, with rows of two-story houses lining the streets. You can hear the sound of kids playing outside on weekends or whenever the sun is out, and the neighborhood is generally quiet on most weekdays. I've never had any issues with my neighbors, and I feel like I can trust them completely. When I order packages online, they always arrive safely on my porch. Our neighborhood is the kind of place where you're left alone unless you need help.\n\nJust a minute or two away from my house is a park that holds a special place in my heart. I've spent countless hours playing basketball, football, and baseball there with the guys from the neighborhood. One of my not-so-fond memories also happened there when I got elbowed in the nose during a football game, but the good times far outweigh the bad. Nowadays, I visit the park with my cousin's kids, who are a lot younger and still enjoy the simple joys of swings and slides. Just thinking about heading to the park gets them excited. The park is now a source of nostalgia for me, reminding me of the good old days.\n\nOur neighborhood is a melting pot of cultures, with a wide variety of food options nearby. Within a one-mile radius, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, with the rise of food delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash, many people prefer to have their meals delivered to their doorstep. The most popular food places are the fast food chains, but you can find those in many suburban neighborhoods. There are also plenty of pizza places to choose from. Our stores have everything you need, with multiple dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store on the same street. Some stores even cater to different tastes, like an Indian-owned store for those who want to cook up some homemade Indian dishes or buy pre-made meals.\n\nI'm grateful for my neighborhood, especially after reading about the horror stories of people dealing with difficult neighbors on social media. It's a blessing to have a community like mine.",
            "My hometown is a quaint little place in South Carolina, blending seamlessly into the rest of the landscape. It's not particularly famous, but it's made its mark in the agricultural sector, thanks to its status as the Peach Capital of the World, proudly displayed on the town's welcoming sign. The town is primarily composed of vast farmlands dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses on the outskirts of town are spaced far apart, mostly two-story structures with metal roofs to shield them from the scorching summer heat or gray shingles. Most homes are nestled away from the main road, allowing the front fields to be used for raising animals or growing crops. Downtown, the town's single traffic light hangs at a four-way intersection, marking the spot where the local stores are concentrated. There are a few eateries where you can grab fast food: Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a local family; Fiesta Mexican Restaurant; or Gary's, a small burger chain. A pizzeria once called the town home, but it closed its doors a while back. The Maxwell and Halford Drug pharmacy is a family-owned business, and it's famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola; not many people know that, though. IGA, a small, pricey grocery store, is the only one in town, but many residents prefer to shop at a Walmart in the nearby Batesburg-Leesville for most of their grocery needs. Dollar General, however, is the most popular spot in town, offering a wide range of everyday items and bustling with activity from opening to closing. Possibilities Furniture & More, a quaint furniture store run by a well-respected woman in the community, has been a part of the town for years and even employs two movers to deliver purchased furniture. Next door, Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a small pet groomer, offers various services, including daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and more. The town has two small medical practices, one for humans and one for animals, located outside the main part of town. Johnston Elementary School is the town's only elementary school, and students usually move on to middle and high school in the next town over after completing fifth grade. Although there aren't any parks in town, the local government is in the process of creating a 2.5-acre recreational area to provide families with more opportunities to spend time together and attract new residents. It's a quiet town, with limited entertainment options – no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or \"hangout\" spots, but it's a nice place, so small it's easy to miss while driving by.",
            "I first heard about my neighborhood through a podcast featuring people who'd gone missing in the area. It was quite surprising to hear. Almost every apartment in the place was renting for over a thousand dollars a month – something none of my friends and I had ever heard about. I guess that's what happens when you're struggling. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night due to financial burdens. We've learned to be frugal over the years, though. You start to appreciate the dusty smell of second-hand toys and mothballed clothes. As you grow older, you come to notice you smell less as well. Some people might start smoking, while others just get accustomed to the state of things. However, the flea market always finds a way to assert itself. The smell of adulthood is that of dusty magazines piled on a closed piano, which even persists after you wash it. In my area, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start from the far side, you can visit two charity thrift stores, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling with cars and people every morning, but you'd never hear the noise in the thrift stores. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the stores remain quiet. It's a great place to lose an afternoon. Every year, the downtown area gets more crowded with cars and people. It's a growing city, they say. One of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery is based here, and it's still showing signs of growth pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is focused on their own goals, and people generally don't pry into one another's lives. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. This is different from the South, where being a little concerned means showing you care. Here, people respect your personal space and won't intrude unless you invite them to. It's a lively and welcoming place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment full of strangers and more of a community of friends who come together for our needs, celebrate our birthdays, mourn our losses, and help each other when we can. I'm fortunate to live here. I quite like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I try to clean up after myself and leave food for them, and they do the same for me. I bring their mail and they bring mine. It's nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. Despite living in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl, it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I haven't completely messed up my life.",
            "I live in a typical suburban area that looks like it's been cut out from a cookie cutter. You can't help but notice the presence of a homeowner's association when you first enter the neighborhood. The streets are filled with well-maintained single-family homes, all thanks to the HOA's hard work. The front yards are almost identical, with a small patch of grass, some decorative pebbles, and short driveways. You'll occasionally spot small trees and two-car garages. As you drive through the neighborhood, you'll notice newly paved concrete roads with no potholes in sight. Most houses are single-story, but some have two stories. One thing that stands out is the mailbox system – instead of individual mailboxes in front of each house, there's a large group of mailboxes at the end of the street, and you need a key to access your specific one. There are also two larger lockers for packages. The HOA's love for uniformity is really evident here. My house is located on the outskirts of the nearby city, so my neighborhood feels like a mix of rural and suburban areas. As a result, we have plenty of space for everything – there are multiple community pools that are well-maintained and gated, as well as walking trails where you can take your dog or go for a solo evening stroll. You don't even need to go to a park to get some exercise; just take a run around the neighborhood and you'll get enough. The community is mostly made up of retired people, but we also have a few middle-aged and young professionals living here. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for each other. We have a small town feel despite being part of a larger city, and we have most of the amenities you'd expect – except for one mall, which is surprisingly sufficient. It takes around 15 minutes to drive to anywhere significant, but once you get there, you have access to a variety of stores, from high-end grocery stores to bargain outlets. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty standard – we have our perks, like pools and walking trails, but we're not exactly next door to a shopping district, so you just hop in the car and head to any major chain store you want.",
            "Living in a small Midwestern town just outside the city's suburbs has its unique charm. Our neighborhood on the town's east side, where I reside, is often regarded as the most economically disadvantaged area. Property values are low, with many homes rented or owned by low-income families, yet this doesn't define the community's character. The friendly neighbors I've encountered smile and greet me as I walk down the street, giving our area a welcoming atmosphere.\n\nWhile crime rates are slightly higher than in other parts of town, they remain relatively low. Unfortunately, there have been a few violent incidents nearby, including shootings and a homicide, which shook our community. Our next-door neighbors suffered a personal loss when their son was killed outside a local bar. Fortunately, our family has been spared from direct harm, apart from occasional incidents of theft when we forget to bring items inside.\n\nThe town as a whole has been heavily impacted by the opioid epidemic, which has ravaged many parts of the United States. The loss of lives due to fentanyl overdoses has been devastating. Thankfully, our town has made efforts to combat this crisis through addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected.\n\nDespite these challenges, our town has many redeeming qualities. My son's elementary school boasts an exceptional staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff, creating a positive and supportive environment. His special needs haven't hindered his experience, and he loves attending school. The active Parent-Teacher Organization (PTO) organizes numerous events to foster family involvement and educational growth.\n\nGiven that over 20% of our town's population lives below the poverty line, the elementary school offers free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. The school's inclusive atmosphere treats every child and family with dignity, regardless of their financial situation. Costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are also reasonable, making education accessible to all.\n\nThe City Council and staff have made significant improvements to the town's appearance, including repaving roads, landscaping, and renovating city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have focused on the town's center and west side, where shopping areas and major traffic flow. The east side, where I reside, tends to be neglected, a point of contention for our community.\n\nDespite these issues, I genuinely appreciate living in this town. The residents are friendly, the schools excel, and we have a variety of shopping options to meet our needs. Our home may not be worth much, but it's comfortable and sufficient. After 16 years, our family cannot imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood has a rich cultural heritage, situated on a hill surrounded by buildings steeped in history. My apartment is in a 7-story building directly across from an old theater, and just a short walk away is a trendy arcade bar that attracts people of all walks of life on warm summer nights. The crowds flocking to it on weekends in June and July are a common sight. A short distance from there is a sizeable city park, with concrete surrounding its perimeter and tall stairs integrated into the wall. During harsh winter months, homeless individuals set up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and the wide steps, seeking shelter from the cold and rain. They prefer to congregate in the town center rather than in the outskirts, making it easier to stay warm and access nearby amenities like the family center where they can bathe and shower.\n\nWhat I love about my city isn't its historic architecture or the majestic buildings that dot the hills leading down to the ocean. It's the people themselves who bring the neighborhood to life. You see, Hilltop was notorious in the past for its gang violence, with stories of federal officials and the DEA attempting to clean up the streets decades ago still lingering in the air. The community hasn't forgotten, and these tales are passed down through generations, including to newcomers like me. Despite being considered one of the tougher neighborhoods in the city, residents work hard to keep it clean and look out for one another. They care deeply about their community and the issues that affect it.\n\nLocals often advise visitors not to walk around the Hill at night, a warning that I believe is rooted in the past and tainted by social biases. Perhaps I'm able to blend in because of my dark skin, or maybe the Hilltop community recognizes me as one of their own, someone who's acutely aware of the societal issues that plague our nation. These issues include racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions born out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that prides itself as a melting pot Utopia. One thing is certain: no matter where life takes me, Hilltop will always be home. I feel a sense of belonging walking those streets at night, meeting people who offer me a jacket or a helping hand rather than causing harm. It's a place where laundromat owners stay open late to let me charge my phone in the rain, and where strangers have offered me kindness and reassurance on the darkest of nights, making me feel seen and valued.",
            "I reside in Rural America, in a quaint small town in Michigan. The landscape shifts from rolling farmland to charming tourist cities, and you'll notice the absence of large shopping malls, retail giants like Walmart, Target, or even the likes of Applebee's. To get to any place, a drive is often the only option. Interestingly, amidst this rustic setting, my town is blessed with breathtaking natural beauty, surrounded by two majestic lakes: beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and the serene Lake Charlevoix on the other. Every direction you look, you'll find a picturesque beach perfect for dipping your toes. The neighborhood I call home embodies the essence of a small town. The houses are not cookie-cutter developments, but rather older, unique homes that reflect the character of the area. Some have been lovingly updated and remodeled, while others retain their original charm. Many of these homes boast spacious basements that are visible from the street, and the neighborhood is dotted with a kaleidoscope of colors, thanks to the diverse range of aluminum siding used on the houses. Yards are a common feature, complete with trampolines, playsets, and gardens, while some homes are fenced to keep pets safe. The atmosphere is quintessentially Midwestern, with hardworking families who value tradition and community. On any given day, you'll see kids playing in the streets, people walking their dogs, biking, or rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors, and you can easily spot those who fit in and those who don't. The sense of community is palpable, with friendly waves and warm smiles exchanged between residents. The lawns are well-maintained, with neatly trimmed grass and tidy gardens. It's not a neighborhood that screams \"look at me,\" but rather one that exudes a sense of warmth and welcoming familiarity. Our town is a haven, a place where families can feel safe and secure. Within walking distance, you'll find the county sheriff's department and jail, as well as the local health department and recycling center, which serve the community with dedication. The nearby baseball and softball fields are a hub of activity, with the sound of announcers calling out scores and player names filling the air. Our small-town airport is also nearby, adding to the area's charm. You can walk to get ice cream from the local parlor, or stroll downtown, which is just a short distance away. My kids can easily ride their bikes to the nearby park, which is just a few blocks away. This is a truly wonderful place to call home."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "Living in a big city, my neighborhood is super diverse. Houses and offices are scattered all over the place, next to each other, as if randomly placed. Some buildings are huge, well-known brands, but there are also small boutiques that are gaining popularity. They're not just found in malls, but also along the streets, which are often within walking distance of quiet neighborhoods. There are also a few parks nearby, and I've noticed that people take their little ones there often. As for the people, my neighborhood is really mixed - there's a big LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a bunch of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union all living in one small area. If you go a bit further out, there are even more people from all sorts of different backgrounds, but they're often grouped together in their own little communities within the city. We have places like Koreatown, Chinatown, and Little Armenia, all just a few miles away. However, driving that short distance can take a long time due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Nobody really walks much in my city, though - even though some cool spots are close by, the city is huge, and people don't like to walk. As a result, our traffic is crazy, and finding a parking spot is almost impossible. It's ironic that the city has been getting a lot of new construction, with big apartment buildings popping up everywhere. But many residents are not happy about it, as it means more people and more cars on the roads. My neighborhood has all sorts of houses, not just big apartment buildings. There are single-family homes, smaller apartments, and condos, all mixed together. Even within my immediate neighborhood, there's a wide range of housing options. The neighborhood is also made up of people of all ages, and I'm not really close to most of my neighbors. It's not like a close-knit community anymore, but I do have fond memories of playing with my next-door neighbor and a few other friends when I was younger.",
            "My neighbourhood has this unique charm. Most of the houses are single-family homes, but there are a few that have been split, yet still connected, if you get what I mean. My home has a small front yard and a driveway to the left. It reminds me of the good old days when the American dream was all about living in the suburbs. This dream, which once seemed to capture the hearts of this nation, is slowly fading away. Yet, my neighbourhood and many others like it still stand as a testament to the dream's enduring spirit. The people living here don't feel as optimistic as they used to, and the upkeep of the yards isn't what it was, but there's still a car or two parked in every driveway, and kids are still playing as if their world is the only one that matters. The old public school, which has been here for almost 90 years, still stands tall, inspiring the youth and evoking nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are scarce, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are always bustling. Although each house looks different, they all feel the same. We have a large supermarket called Super \"A\" run by a big Yemeni family, who are possibly the only Arab family in the neighbourhood. Most residents are African American. The streets are wide, and kids usually play football, only stopping to let cars pass. Many people in my neighbourhood have lived here for generations, and most have stories to share about a time when everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school, but after the karate kid movies stopped, the kids lost interest, so it's now a pharmacy. They say drugs can fix everything. There's also a small movie theatre that shows old movies at a discounted price, avoided by the youth for its outdated titles, but cherished by the elders who think it's worth a night out without the kids. We have an expressway that passes through our town, but the entrance and exit are actually in the next town over. There was a petition to get an exit for our town, but the youth supported it, while the elders opposed it, fearing it would ruin our town. So, they convinced the city council to reject the request. We're building a new high school, and we're trying to decide on a mascot for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the perfect representation of our town.",
            "At first glance, it's easy to overlook this place - it seems like a typical residential area behind a shopping strip, not really a neighborhood one would expect to find homes in. But if you walk behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and head towards the hotels that are only used for annual visits, aside from the occasional summer get-togethers, you'll stumble upon a thriving community. Among these communities are a series of apartment complexes, carefully arranged side by side like Russian nesting dolls that have been taken apart and placed in line along the road. \n\nWhile the apartments at the beginning of the row have gotten some bad press, we'll focus on the others. The ones next to those complexes, and the ones next to that, reveal a completely different world that's rarely known to locals. A community college's satellite campus is situated across from these complexes, its quiet, sleepy buildings standing guard beside the road. Students start their days with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning as they head to class. The entrance gates creak open one at a time, causing some morning commuters to groan in frustration.\n\nA residential road intersects with the main road, flanked by a park and a rehabilitation center for people with broken bones. The treatment center boasts a cheerful porch area, and a lazily spinning ceiling fan that stirs the warm summer air. Children play in the park across the street, laughing and spinning around in the grass while bees buzz lazily in the nearby flower patches. Retirees walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on skateboards and nodding politely at the teenage girls chatting by the playground equipment. There's a sushi place in a nearby strip mall with affordable food, a swimming supply store right next door, and a nail salon nestled in between. You can get your pool filled for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken - a true strip mall experience. A frozen yogurt shop is also nearby, where teens often grab a cold treat while showing off their skateboarding skills and vaping because they think it's the coolest.\n\nThis neighborhood is a quintessential piece of American history, a small town in the south where time seems to stand still and nothing much changes.",
            "We were driving through an endless expanse of cornfields as she gazed out at the horizon in awe. \"Where are we?\" she asked, taken aback by the vast open space. I chuckled, knowing she'd be shocked by the stark contrast to her hometown where the grocery store was just a stone's throw away. I shared with her what it was like growing up in rural Ohio, where the cornfields stretched as far as the eye could see. In that moment, she finally got a glimpse of who I was and where I came from.\n\nAs we drove down the winding country road, the landscape gave way to a quarry filled with water, and then a small development that was home. The houses were a mix of brick and stucco, each one sprawling across at least half an acre of land that everyone took pride in keeping immaculate. In the spring, flowers bloomed alongside the midwestern trees that changed with the seasons, and the driveways were lined with sleek Mercedes-Benz luxury cars that glistened in the sunlight after a good wash.\n\nAs we turned onto my street, my neighbour, a friendly Korean man, was always outside, tending to his lawn with a song in his heart. He'd spend the entire day mowing, his voice blending in with the hum of his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Everyone in the neighbourhood loved him for his genuine nature and the unique stories he had to share. Though he'd lost some of his wit with age, he was still an amazing person who'd lived a life full of adventure as a doctor.\n\nMy home came into view, and in the side yard, geese waddled about, chased by our mischievous Terrier. Behind the house, a small stream flowed into the quarry, where the sounds of bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional \"moo\" from the nearby farms created a soothing melody. On the other side of the handmade wooden bridge lay a hidden oasis teeming with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. It was my childhood playground, where I spent my days building tree forts, \"hunting\" imaginary prey, and making friends with the kids from the neighbourhood. The winters were harsh, but there was something magical about it. The yard would transform from a lush green to a barren wilderness, and the trees that once bloomed with vibrant flowers would stand as skeletal sentinels of bark. And when snow fell, a winter wonderland would appear overnight, complete with snow angels and snowmen crafted by my little sister. We'd engage in fierce snowball fights, building massive forts to house our arsenal of branches. It was our own little world, where nothing else mattered, and we were just carefree kids.",
            "First off, to truly grasp the essence of Portland, Oregon, one must understand the meaning behind \"weird\". The phrase, which adorns a building that serves multiple purposes like a pizza joint, bar, music venue, and more, is an unofficial town slogan that goes by \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, it's a nostalgic call to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's - a time when the city was less known and less crowded, fostering unique and creative subcultures. To others, it's an invitation to visit a place where being called \"weird\" is considered a badge of honor.\n\nDespite the influx of affluent Californians and the rise of condominiums, Portland still maintains its offbeat charm. Being \"weird\" in Portland doesn't necessarily mean accepting anything, but rather embracing differences that are often shunned by society. We're not immune to modern conveniences and conflicts like the rest of the country, as we import most of our goods from China. However, there are countless ways to be \"weird\" or \"not normal\" in Portland, and we have our fair share of normalcy too. You'll find yoga enthusiasts, hipsters, and business professionals living alongside the rest of us.\n\nPerhaps what makes Portland truly \"weird\" is that we don't take ourselves too seriously. In my neighborhood, like many others, you'll spot colorful houses, vibrant home gardens, and free boxes lining the streets during the summer months. Free boxes typically contain items people are getting rid of, but they can be anything from clothes and books to unexpected treasures. The thrill of discovering something valuable in a free box is a big part of what makes Portland special, and it's a feeling that's unique to each neighborhood in the city.\n\nPortland has its quirkiness, and I'm just one example of the many weird and wonderful residents here. Some people I live among wouldn't dream of rummaging through boxes on the sidewalk, opting instead for activities like goat yoga or cheering on the city's soccer team at a Timbers match. What I love about Portland is its diversity - people here pursue their passions, whether it's starting a business, playing music, or simply enjoying a cold beer at the bar.\n\nOf course, like any city, Portland has its problems. We struggle with a drug issue that often stems from underlying mental health issues, and the constant rain doesn't help. We also have a homelessness problem that's a challenge to solve, with services that are insufficient but still better than in many other parts of the country. The non-homeless population is torn between feeling empathy and frustration towards the homeless. In this regard, Portland is not so \"weird\" after all.",
            "The mountains stand tall, a constant presence in the north, silently witnessing the passage of time as the sun rises and sets each day. Irrespective of how engrossed I am in work or life, they persist, unyielding to the ebbs and flows of life's turmoil. On days when I'm overwhelmed with stress and anxiety, they beckon me, and when I turn to them, they offer a respite, lending me the strength to carry on, one day at a time. It was during my undergraduate days that I first discovered their allure. While the university campus boasts its own share of breathtaking views, the mountains that lie to the north of the campus have an enduring hold on my heart. The university's charm, with its beautiful buildings, ponds, and trees, has won a part of my affection, but it's the mountains that hold the top spot. The rest of the town is equally captivating, with its array of quaint cafés where I spent countless hours fueled by caffeine and determination. A short walk or bus ride takes you to the downtown area, where the faded brick facades transport you to a bygone era, infusing the air with an aura of antiquity. Amidst this blend of suburban tranquility and urban vigor, the town presents a unique charm, an invitation to explore. The juxtaposition of these contrasting atmospheres within close proximity creates a captivating essence, as if beckoning me to uncover its secrets. With time, I've accumulated numerous cherished memories, each tied to a specific part of town, whether it's walking past the rusted swings in the park after a sleepless night with friends or racing through the bustling downtown to catch a movie that the university had provided tickets for. Alas, life has also bestowed upon me numerous harsh memories, a universal aspect of our experiences. The ponds, in particular, have come to serve as a poignant reminder of my introspective moments, as well as the many tears I've shed in the dead of night, grappling with existential crises. While watching the turtles, ducks, and insects live their lives, each with a role to play, I couldn't help but ponder my own purpose as I navigated the complexities of life. As I strolled past the pond, the park, and the quaint houses that epitomize suburban life, I eventually reached the main street, where the sun's rays danced across the palm trees, casting a kaleidoscope of colors across the sky. In that moment, as I gazed up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. And there they were – the mountains, steadfast and resolute, their presence speaking volumes, stirring within me a sense of resilience.",
            "Bensonhurst, Brooklyn - it's no secret that finding your way here is a breeze, thanks to the excellent public transportation system that's as accessible as it is convenient. As one of New York City's most popular forms of transportation, you'll find it easy to get around. With Bensonhurst being a bustling urban neighborhood, you'll still get that quintessential NYC vibe. During your visit, get ready to be surrounded by the numerous Asian stores that seem to be on every corner. It's no coincidence that this neighborhood has become a hub for Asian inhabitants over the past two decades, which is reflected in the abundance of Asian-owned stores. Supermarkets and laundromats are the most popular, and for good reason - they offer top-notch food, unbeatable prices, and unparalleled convenience. Just a stone's throw away from where I am, there are no less than four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walking distance from each other, making grocery shopping a total cinch.\n\nDon't get me wrong, Bensonhurst isn't a sea of Asian faces - it's a melting pot of cultures, with immigrants and their American-born children calling the neighborhood home. The majority of local businesses are still Asian-owned, though, and it's not uncommon to see families and friends of all ages enjoying the vibrant atmosphere. Just a short walk away, you'll find a newly renovated park that's a gem of the neighborhood. With ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for the summer months, there's something for everyone. As you'd expect in New York City, the park is a haven for diversity, and people of all ages and backgrounds come together to play and socialize.\n\nIn terms of housing, you won't find any large corporate buildings here - instead, co-op living and condominium apartments are the norm, with most residents calling two-family houses home. While the majority of people are friendly and welcoming, be prepared for some noise pollution. You'll often hear cars blasting their music, or people flooring it down the road, which can be a bit jarring. If you're visiting at night, it's a good idea to keep your wits about you - while Bensonhurst is generally a safe neighborhood, you never know when you might encounter someone looking for trouble. I've had my own run-ins with bullies and package thieves, but these incidents were a while back. Just remember to keep your shoes clean and be mindful of your surroundings!",
            "My home is nestled at the top of a steep hill, and I'm surrounded by a neighborhood with a unique landscape. People often call it the \"workout hill\" because joggers love to tackle the incline. Since there are no sidewalks, everyone walks on the road, which is a bit hazardous with its potholes and uneven surface. The street's lined with worn-out telephone and electric wires, which are frequently damaged by falling branches and debris from the many storms we get. Evergreen trees abound, but surprisingly, most people here dislike them, as they obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many houses are built high up on the hill, with large glass windows to take in the stunning view of the bay. Watching the sunset is breathtaking, with the water glowing from below and the sky turning orange. However, it's often cloudy, so the sunlight's filtered through a haze. The atmosphere's usually overcast and damp, which contributes to the lush growth of moss on everything – roofs, cars, and even railings. I once left my car in the driveway for a month, and when I returned, it was covered in a thick layer of moss that took me three hours to scrub off. Our neighborhood's relatively quiet, with only a few kids around, thanks to a school nearby. The majority of residents are retired folks, and instead of kids, we have plenty of dogs roaming around. It's not uncommon to see them lounging in people's lawns or racing down the street. If you leave a door or window open, they might sneak in, like when I once found one lounging in my living room and had to shoo it out. Rabbits are also abundant, and they love to dig up plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats have helped keep them under control, though. We also have a variety of birds, including small sparrows and hummingbirds, and occasionally, a hawk or eagle will swoop by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. While we don't have any stores nearby, a short hike down to the waterfront leads to a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. The beach itself isn't extensive, but the rocks along the shore make for fun skipping stones into the water. On most days, you can see the opposite shoreline clearly through the mist.",
            "I've been living in a typical suburban area in a small town in Tennessee for a while now. Our street is situated between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic than I'd like, but other than that, it's a pretty quiet neighborhood. We're not used to having many new faces around here, so I've gotten to know most of the regulars. Folks usually spend their time tending to their lawns and daily chores. In the winter, we enjoy sledding down the hill on our side street. Since we live in a house at the corner of our street, we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that roll through here. Whenever we spot a strange vehicle, we tend to take notice. Some of the neighbors like to take a stroll for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids are always out on their bikes, and you can hear the usual sounds of a small town. As we work from home, we're mostly at home, along with my wife and our two daughters, ages eleven and fourteen. So, it's no surprise that everyone else is used to seeing us come and go. We enjoy spending time outdoors, even when it's raining, and sometimes we fire up the grill on our back deck, filling the air with the delicious smell of barbecue. You can almost always hear the sound of lawn mowers from March to October, when the grass finally stops growing. Our neighborhood used to be wooded, so there are plenty of trees providing shade, but that also means raking and burning leaves every year in the Fall. I must admit, the smell of burning leaves is one of my favorites – it's a sure sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not had much of a Winter, so it feels like it's been one long Fall. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone knocks on the door, which is a rare occurrence. I like to tinker with my truck or other projects in the garage, and when the doors are open, it feels like I'm more connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, things are pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving and other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas bring some extra visitors, and you can spot more cars parked along the street. All in all, I'm quite happy living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "Yesterday, I found myself pondering about my neighborhood, situated smack dab in the middle of the high desert. The endless expanse of brown dirt stretches out before me, a constant reminder of the harsh yet beautiful environment I call home. Unless you've experienced living here firsthand, it's hard to comprehend the monotony of gazing out at the same dull landscape day in and day out. But when you do chance upon a well-manicured lawn, you know that person has invested a small fortune in lawn care. I've lived in this area since the 90s, and although the houses have sprouted up around me, the layout still feels largely the same. In fact, it's a bit eerie how much this place resembles a city, yet, like many other places, it's undergoing rapid transformation. The locals are generally friendly, but, just like any city, there's a mix of the good and the not-so-good. I'm surrounded by friendly elderly folks, which makes my neighborhood feel like a nicer community. The local stores are mostly chain stores, like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final, but if you're looking for upscale options, you're better off traveling elsewhere. I rarely see any Whole Foods or boutiques around here. The dominant industries in my city appear to be construction, given its relatively underdeveloped state and the abundance of open spaces waiting to be built upon. This thought unsettles me, as I prefer things the way they are now. I left behind a big city and don't fancy going back. My full-time job is in the construction field, specifically as a drywall and T-bar installer, which means I'm somewhat invested in its growth. What I appreciate about my home, however, is the unique wildlife. People flock to the high desert for its breathtaking beauty, and the challenging ecosystems it supports have created an opportunity for various species to thrive. It's essential for human residents to learn about and respect the non-human inhabitants of this environment to coexist peacefully. My family and I have adapted well to the wildlife, and my kids are particularly fascinated by lizards and desert bugs. As I write this, they're outside, trying to catch different specimens. As for attractions, we have a few gems. Victorville is a great destination for families looking to experience the desert, and if you plan your visit to coincide with the annual San Bernardino County Fair, you'll have a fantastic time. The fair offers an excellent mix of activities and fun, showcasing the Victorville way. If you're looking for a winter sports fix, head over to Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and take a lesson or two. Lastly, the Victor Valley Museum is a treasure trove of geological, paleontological, and Native American artifacts that provide valuable insights into the history and development of the high desert ecosystem.",
            "My neighborhood might sound like everyone else's, but trust me, it's unique. Unlike others who probably live in their own individual houses, I consider my neighborhood to be the campus I'm on and the people in my dormitory as my community. The surrounding campus is part of my neighborhood too, although it's not as central as the dorm. Despite being a bit unusual, my neighborhood shares some familiar traits with the typical idea of a neighborhood. Just like any normal neighborhood, it's got houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's dive into the 'houses' that make up my neighborhood. Before I do, I need to clarify the types of houses we have here. There are three kinds: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory houses. Apartments usually have 2-4 people in each room, with 4-6 rooms per floor, and about 20 people in each building. The actual houses are a bit rare, with 2-4 bedrooms, mostly occupied by alumni. Then there are the dorm rooms, where hundreds of students live, with each room housing 2 people, except in some cases. They're the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. Now, let's talk about the people. My school is proud of its diversity, and it shows in the neighborhood. You'll find people from all cultures and ages here. Professionals usually live in the houses, while new students are in dorms, and older students are in apartments. We can't do the people justice, so let's move on to the stores and park. Since my school is a mini-neighborhood, it has plenty of stores and a single park. The stores offer a mix of dining options and the school's unique brand of clothes and groceries. You can find anything you need within our neighborhood's boundaries. The park is our playground, kept clean and safe by everyone in the community.",
            "I've been living in this neighborhood for about 10 years now, so I guess it's time for me to share some stories about it. When I first moved here from Riverdale to Stockbridge, I was pretty sad because I missed my old home and the people I loved. My mom and dad made the tough decision to move us to a better neighborhood for a better life, a better school, and a safer environment. It wasn't easy, but I eventually got used to it and made some new friends, as well as some new enemies in school. To be honest, I never really got to know my neighbors that well, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and to a lesser extent, Dennis, who lived right next door. They've been like a family to me, and I feel grateful for having them in my life. I remember attending Mr. Glen's wedding, which was a great experience, and something I hope to replicate in my own life someday. When Ms. Veda threw off her prosthetic leg strap during the wedding, I managed to catch it, but unfortunately not the flowers. We danced the night away, and I had a blast with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I've lost touch with her since, but I hope she's doing well. The neighborhood can be confusing, but now that I have a GPS, I've been exploring it more. I've hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis a few times, and we used to spend hours playing video games and enjoying life. I also love visiting the park and appreciating nature, which helps me feel more calm and at peace. I often take sticks from Home Depot and practice my balance, and I enjoy wielding my bokken wooden sword. There are also a basketball and tennis court nearby, although I haven't played either sport in a while. My dad used to coach me and my best friend in tennis with Mr. Graves, and those were some of the best times. They pushed us hard, but we always had fun. Looking back, I've had a lot of fun in this neighborhood, and there are plenty of stories I could share, but these are the ones that stand out to me. I'm excited to see what the future holds.",
            "I'm really lucky to be living near the college I attend, and I think that's one of the best things about where I live. My neighborhood is pretty chill, with mostly apartment buildings and a few fun, affordable bars and restaurants to hang out at. One of the bars has just changed its name, but it's still not too pricey and the service and drinks are alright. Most of the people around here are either students or lower-income folks who can afford the apartments, which is pretty cool. You can hear the sound of kids playing since there's an elementary school nearby, within walking distance of my place. To be honest, I don't really know my neighbors - they're a bit too into smoking weed, and the management installed an air freshener unit right outside their door, which my boyfriend and I thought was pretty funny. It's almost like they're trying to send a message. The buildings around me are a bit old-fashioned, but they might have been renovated on the inside. Down the street, there are brand new apartments, but I'm not a fan - they're super cheaply built but the rent is way too high, which I think is just taking advantage of people. Since they're close to campus, though, the management gets away with it. There's this one super cheap eatery about a 5-minute walk from my place that only serves food on paper plates and most of their dishes are microwaved. Across from that is a gas station that's not exactly the best place to work. But thanks to some city funding, they redid the road last summer, so now we have a nice big sidewalk, some grass on the median and the sides, and the area looks a lot nicer. The apartment building I live in has a lot of trees around it, but they cut some down, so now there are a few stumps left. There are way more trees where I live than down the street. Behind my apartment complex is a line of trees and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street, which isn't as nice. The sidewalks are in bad shape and the buildings look pretty shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but I think they're just trying to hide the state of the buildings. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but I don't blame them entirely - there are other apartments across the street with their own problems and a pretty transient population. Despite all this, I really like where I live. It's affordable, and there are plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially love that the university is within walking distance, and there are two bus stops so I can easily get to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood is a haven of colorful duplexes nestled in a cul-de-sac. The houses are spread out in a way that makes them seem like individual homes, with only one notable difference - each one is painted a cheerful yellow, adorned with white porches and green metal roofs. While not everyone is close friends, there's a sense of camaraderie that permeates the air. On some evenings, you'll find us gathered at the end of a driveway, chatting and laughing as the kids play with their toys, sidewalk chalk, or fly their kites. It's a refreshing escape from the hustle and bustle of the modern world, a step back in time when life was simpler. The surrounding fields and trees are a stunning backdrop, set against a brilliant blue sky with puffy white clouds. However, this season has brought a new challenge - tornado warnings, which recently culminated in our first-ever experience of actual sirens blaring, prompting us to seek shelter. I was huddled in my bathtub with my smallest dog and some essentials, while my bigger dog stayed put in the living room, anxious and barking. The neighborhood was eerily quiet, except for the sound of large hail pounding the ground. After the storm, the temperature dropped dramatically, and the road was suddenly steaming hot. The hail melted instantly on the pavement as the sun broke through the clearing skies and a double rainbow appeared. I dashed inside to grab my camera and snapped some pictures to share with my friends and family on Facebook - they were as amazed as I was. It took about an hour for the streets to return to normal, and soon the familiar sounds of mom's cooking and children's laughter filled the air. I've grown to love this friendly community, especially the warm Southern accents that fill the air. My two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment is just like everyone else's on the outside, but each one has its unique character on the inside. It's puzzling why some apartments are so small, but it's a minor quirk in an otherwise idyllic setting. I adore strolling through the vast field behind my home, meandering down to the pond that's not meant for swimming. I've spotted deer and even heard the majestic bullfrog's morning serenade. It's a fantastic place to live, just a 40-minute drive from the city of Charlotte. Every morning begins with the cheerful sound of roosters crowing from the nearby farms, creating a sense of community that's hard to find in the city. We even have a friendly donkey at a nearby farm that brays in the evening, reminding us of its presence. I feel lucky to have discovered this hidden gem of a neighborhood.",
            "I stepped into my new neighborhood just as I was about to enter the world of eighth grade. At first, it was tough to connect with the locals, but fate had other plans, and I formed a bond with a guy living right next door and another fellow on my street. Although they're no longer around, the memories remain vivid. The people who were here when I first arrived are still here, giving our neighborhood a sense of continuity. Our neighborhood is just like any other American suburban neighborhood, with rows of two-story houses lining the streets. You can hear the sound of kids playing outside on weekends or whenever the sun is out, and the neighborhood is generally quiet on most weekdays. I've never had any issues with my neighbors, and I feel like I can trust them completely. When I order packages online, they always arrive safely on my porch. Our neighborhood is the kind of place where you're left alone unless you need help.\n\nJust a minute or two away from my house is a park that holds a special place in my heart. I've spent countless hours playing basketball, football, and baseball there with the guys from the neighborhood. One of my not-so-fond memories also happened there when I got elbowed in the nose during a football game, but the good times far outweigh the bad. Nowadays, I visit the park with my cousin's kids, who are a lot younger and still enjoy the simple joys of swings and slides. Just thinking about heading to the park gets them excited. The park is now a source of nostalgia for me, reminding me of the good old days.\n\nOur neighborhood is a melting pot of cultures, with a wide variety of food options nearby. Within a one-mile radius, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, with the rise of food delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash, many people prefer to have their meals delivered to their doorstep. The most popular food places are the fast food chains, but you can find those in many suburban neighborhoods. There are also plenty of pizza places to choose from. Our stores have everything you need, with multiple dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store on the same street. Some stores even cater to different tastes, like an Indian-owned store for those who want to cook up some homemade Indian dishes or buy pre-made meals.\n\nI'm grateful for my neighborhood, especially after reading about the horror stories of people dealing with difficult neighbors on social media. It's a blessing to have a community like mine.",
            "My hometown is a quaint little place in South Carolina, blending seamlessly into the rest of the landscape. It's not particularly famous, but it's made its mark in the agricultural sector, thanks to its status as the Peach Capital of the World, proudly displayed on the town's welcoming sign. The town is primarily composed of vast farmlands dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses on the outskirts of town are spaced far apart, mostly two-story structures with metal roofs to shield them from the scorching summer heat or gray shingles. Most homes are nestled away from the main road, allowing the front fields to be used for raising animals or growing crops. Downtown, the town's single traffic light hangs at a four-way intersection, marking the spot where the local stores are concentrated. There are a few eateries where you can grab fast food: Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a local family; Fiesta Mexican Restaurant; or Gary's, a small burger chain. A pizzeria once called the town home, but it closed its doors a while back. The Maxwell and Halford Drug pharmacy is a family-owned business, and it's famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola; not many people know that, though. IGA, a small, pricey grocery store, is the only one in town, but many residents prefer to shop at a Walmart in the nearby Batesburg-Leesville for most of their grocery needs. Dollar General, however, is the most popular spot in town, offering a wide range of everyday items and bustling with activity from opening to closing. Possibilities Furniture & More, a quaint furniture store run by a well-respected woman in the community, has been a part of the town for years and even employs two movers to deliver purchased furniture. Next door, Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a small pet groomer, offers various services, including daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and more. The town has two small medical practices, one for humans and one for animals, located outside the main part of town. Johnston Elementary School is the town's only elementary school, and students usually move on to middle and high school in the next town over after completing fifth grade. Although there aren't any parks in town, the local government is in the process of creating a 2.5-acre recreational area to provide families with more opportunities to spend time together and attract new residents. It's a quiet town, with limited entertainment options – no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or \"hangout\" spots, but it's a nice place, so small it's easy to miss while driving by.",
            "I first heard about my neighborhood through a podcast featuring people who'd gone missing in the area. It was quite surprising to hear. Almost every apartment in the place was renting for over a thousand dollars a month – something none of my friends and I had ever heard about. I guess that's what happens when you're struggling. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night due to financial burdens. We've learned to be frugal over the years, though. You start to appreciate the dusty smell of second-hand toys and mothballed clothes. As you grow older, you come to notice you smell less as well. Some people might start smoking, while others just get accustomed to the state of things. However, the flea market always finds a way to assert itself. The smell of adulthood is that of dusty magazines piled on a closed piano, which even persists after you wash it. In my area, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start from the far side, you can visit two charity thrift stores, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling with cars and people every morning, but you'd never hear the noise in the thrift stores. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the stores remain quiet. It's a great place to lose an afternoon. Every year, the downtown area gets more crowded with cars and people. It's a growing city, they say. One of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery is based here, and it's still showing signs of growth pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is focused on their own goals, and people generally don't pry into one another's lives. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. This is different from the South, where being a little concerned means showing you care. Here, people respect your personal space and won't intrude unless you invite them to. It's a lively and welcoming place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment full of strangers and more of a community of friends who come together for our needs, celebrate our birthdays, mourn our losses, and help each other when we can. I'm fortunate to live here. I quite like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I try to clean up after myself and leave food for them, and they do the same for me. I bring their mail and they bring mine. It's nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. Despite living in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl, it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I haven't completely messed up my life.",
            "I live in a typical suburban area that looks like it's been cut out from a cookie cutter. You can't help but notice the presence of a homeowner's association when you first enter the neighborhood. The streets are filled with well-maintained single-family homes, all thanks to the HOA's hard work. The front yards are almost identical, with a small patch of grass, some decorative pebbles, and short driveways. You'll occasionally spot small trees and two-car garages. As you drive through the neighborhood, you'll notice newly paved concrete roads with no potholes in sight. Most houses are single-story, but some have two stories. One thing that stands out is the mailbox system – instead of individual mailboxes in front of each house, there's a large group of mailboxes at the end of the street, and you need a key to access your specific one. There are also two larger lockers for packages. The HOA's love for uniformity is really evident here. My house is located on the outskirts of the nearby city, so my neighborhood feels like a mix of rural and suburban areas. As a result, we have plenty of space for everything – there are multiple community pools that are well-maintained and gated, as well as walking trails where you can take your dog or go for a solo evening stroll. You don't even need to go to a park to get some exercise; just take a run around the neighborhood and you'll get enough. The community is mostly made up of retired people, but we also have a few middle-aged and young professionals living here. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for each other. We have a small town feel despite being part of a larger city, and we have most of the amenities you'd expect – except for one mall, which is surprisingly sufficient. It takes around 15 minutes to drive to anywhere significant, but once you get there, you have access to a variety of stores, from high-end grocery stores to bargain outlets. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty standard – we have our perks, like pools and walking trails, but we're not exactly next door to a shopping district, so you just hop in the car and head to any major chain store you want.",
            "Living in a small Midwestern town just outside the city's suburbs has its unique charm. Our neighborhood on the town's east side, where I reside, is often regarded as the most economically disadvantaged area. Property values are low, with many homes rented or owned by low-income families, yet this doesn't define the community's character. The friendly neighbors I've encountered smile and greet me as I walk down the street, giving our area a welcoming atmosphere.\n\nWhile crime rates are slightly higher than in other parts of town, they remain relatively low. Unfortunately, there have been a few violent incidents nearby, including shootings and a homicide, which shook our community. Our next-door neighbors suffered a personal loss when their son was killed outside a local bar. Fortunately, our family has been spared from direct harm, apart from occasional incidents of theft when we forget to bring items inside.\n\nThe town as a whole has been heavily impacted by the opioid epidemic, which has ravaged many parts of the United States. The loss of lives due to fentanyl overdoses has been devastating. Thankfully, our town has made efforts to combat this crisis through addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected.\n\nDespite these challenges, our town has many redeeming qualities. My son's elementary school boasts an exceptional staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff, creating a positive and supportive environment. His special needs haven't hindered his experience, and he loves attending school. The active Parent-Teacher Organization (PTO) organizes numerous events to foster family involvement and educational growth.\n\nGiven that over 20% of our town's population lives below the poverty line, the elementary school offers free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. The school's inclusive atmosphere treats every child and family with dignity, regardless of their financial situation. Costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are also reasonable, making education accessible to all.\n\nThe City Council and staff have made significant improvements to the town's appearance, including repaving roads, landscaping, and renovating city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have focused on the town's center and west side, where shopping areas and major traffic flow. The east side, where I reside, tends to be neglected, a point of contention for our community.\n\nDespite these issues, I genuinely appreciate living in this town. The residents are friendly, the schools excel, and we have a variety of shopping options to meet our needs. Our home may not be worth much, but it's comfortable and sufficient. After 16 years, our family cannot imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood has a rich cultural heritage, situated on a hill surrounded by buildings steeped in history. My apartment is in a 7-story building directly across from an old theater, and just a short walk away is a trendy arcade bar that attracts people of all walks of life on warm summer nights. The crowds flocking to it on weekends in June and July are a common sight. A short distance from there is a sizeable city park, with concrete surrounding its perimeter and tall stairs integrated into the wall. During harsh winter months, homeless individuals set up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and the wide steps, seeking shelter from the cold and rain. They prefer to congregate in the town center rather than in the outskirts, making it easier to stay warm and access nearby amenities like the family center where they can bathe and shower.\n\nWhat I love about my city isn't its historic architecture or the majestic buildings that dot the hills leading down to the ocean. It's the people themselves who bring the neighborhood to life. You see, Hilltop was notorious in the past for its gang violence, with stories of federal officials and the DEA attempting to clean up the streets decades ago still lingering in the air. The community hasn't forgotten, and these tales are passed down through generations, including to newcomers like me. Despite being considered one of the tougher neighborhoods in the city, residents work hard to keep it clean and look out for one another. They care deeply about their community and the issues that affect it.\n\nLocals often advise visitors not to walk around the Hill at night, a warning that I believe is rooted in the past and tainted by social biases. Perhaps I'm able to blend in because of my dark skin, or maybe the Hilltop community recognizes me as one of their own, someone who's acutely aware of the societal issues that plague our nation. These issues include racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions born out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that prides itself as a melting pot Utopia. One thing is certain: no matter where life takes me, Hilltop will always be home. I feel a sense of belonging walking those streets at night, meeting people who offer me a jacket or a helping hand rather than causing harm. It's a place where laundromat owners stay open late to let me charge my phone in the rain, and where strangers have offered me kindness and reassurance on the darkest of nights, making me feel seen and valued.",
            "I reside in Rural America, in a quaint small town in Michigan. The landscape shifts from rolling farmland to charming tourist cities, and you'll notice the absence of large shopping malls, retail giants like Walmart, Target, or even the likes of Applebee's. To get to any place, a drive is often the only option. Interestingly, amidst this rustic setting, my town is blessed with breathtaking natural beauty, surrounded by two majestic lakes: beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and the serene Lake Charlevoix on the other. Every direction you look, you'll find a picturesque beach perfect for dipping your toes. The neighborhood I call home embodies the essence of a small town. The houses are not cookie-cutter developments, but rather older, unique homes that reflect the character of the area. Some have been lovingly updated and remodeled, while others retain their original charm. Many of these homes boast spacious basements that are visible from the street, and the neighborhood is dotted with a kaleidoscope of colors, thanks to the diverse range of aluminum siding used on the houses. Yards are a common feature, complete with trampolines, playsets, and gardens, while some homes are fenced to keep pets safe. The atmosphere is quintessentially Midwestern, with hardworking families who value tradition and community. On any given day, you'll see kids playing in the streets, people walking their dogs, biking, or rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors, and you can easily spot those who fit in and those who don't. The sense of community is palpable, with friendly waves and warm smiles exchanged between residents. The lawns are well-maintained, with neatly trimmed grass and tidy gardens. It's not a neighborhood that screams \"look at me,\" but rather one that exudes a sense of warmth and welcoming familiarity. Our town is a haven, a place where families can feel safe and secure. Within walking distance, you'll find the county sheriff's department and jail, as well as the local health department and recycling center, which serve the community with dedication. The nearby baseball and softball fields are a hub of activity, with the sound of announcers calling out scores and player names filling the air. Our small-town airport is also nearby, adding to the area's charm. You can walk to get ice cream from the local parlor, or stroll downtown, which is just a short distance away. My kids can easily ride their bikes to the nearby park, which is just a few blocks away. This is a truly wonderful place to call home."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "Living in a big city, my neighborhood is super diverse. Houses and offices are scattered all over the place, next to each other, as if randomly placed. Some buildings are huge, well-known brands, but there are also small boutiques that are gaining popularity. They're not just found in malls, but also along the streets, which are often within walking distance of quiet neighborhoods. There are also a few parks nearby, and I've noticed that people take their little ones there often. As for the people, my neighborhood is really mixed - there's a big LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a bunch of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union all living in one small area. If you go a bit further out, there are even more people from all sorts of different backgrounds, but they're often grouped together in their own little communities within the city. We have places like Koreatown, Chinatown, and Little Armenia, all just a few miles away. However, driving that short distance can take a long time due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Nobody really walks much in my city, though - even though some cool spots are close by, the city is huge, and people don't like to walk. As a result, our traffic is crazy, and finding a parking spot is almost impossible. It's ironic that the city has been getting a lot of new construction, with big apartment buildings popping up everywhere. But many residents are not happy about it, as it means more people and more cars on the roads. My neighborhood has all sorts of houses, not just big apartment buildings. There are single-family homes, smaller apartments, and condos, all mixed together. Even within my immediate neighborhood, there's a wide range of housing options. The neighborhood is also made up of people of all ages, and I'm not really close to most of my neighbors. It's not like a close-knit community anymore, but I do have fond memories of playing with my next-door neighbor and a few other friends when I was younger.",
            "My neighbourhood has this unique charm. Most of the houses are single-family homes, but there are a few that have been split, yet still connected, if you get what I mean. My home has a small front yard and a driveway to the left. It reminds me of the good old days when the American dream was all about living in the suburbs. This dream, which once seemed to capture the hearts of this nation, is slowly fading away. Yet, my neighbourhood and many others like it still stand as a testament to the dream's enduring spirit. The people living here don't feel as optimistic as they used to, and the upkeep of the yards isn't what it was, but there's still a car or two parked in every driveway, and kids are still playing as if their world is the only one that matters. The old public school, which has been here for almost 90 years, still stands tall, inspiring the youth and evoking nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are scarce, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are always bustling. Although each house looks different, they all feel the same. We have a large supermarket called Super \"A\" run by a big Yemeni family, who are possibly the only Arab family in the neighbourhood. Most residents are African American. The streets are wide, and kids usually play football, only stopping to let cars pass. Many people in my neighbourhood have lived here for generations, and most have stories to share about a time when everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school, but after the karate kid movies stopped, the kids lost interest, so it's now a pharmacy. They say drugs can fix everything. There's also a small movie theatre that shows old movies at a discounted price, avoided by the youth for its outdated titles, but cherished by the elders who think it's worth a night out without the kids. We have an expressway that passes through our town, but the entrance and exit are actually in the next town over. There was a petition to get an exit for our town, but the youth supported it, while the elders opposed it, fearing it would ruin our town. So, they convinced the city council to reject the request. We're building a new high school, and we're trying to decide on a mascot for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the perfect representation of our town.",
            "At first glance, it's easy to overlook this place - it seems like a typical residential area behind a shopping strip, not really a neighborhood one would expect to find homes in. But if you walk behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and head towards the hotels that are only used for annual visits, aside from the occasional summer get-togethers, you'll stumble upon a thriving community. Among these communities are a series of apartment complexes, carefully arranged side by side like Russian nesting dolls that have been taken apart and placed in line along the road. \n\nWhile the apartments at the beginning of the row have gotten some bad press, we'll focus on the others. The ones next to those complexes, and the ones next to that, reveal a completely different world that's rarely known to locals. A community college's satellite campus is situated across from these complexes, its quiet, sleepy buildings standing guard beside the road. Students start their days with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning as they head to class. The entrance gates creak open one at a time, causing some morning commuters to groan in frustration.\n\nA residential road intersects with the main road, flanked by a park and a rehabilitation center for people with broken bones. The treatment center boasts a cheerful porch area, and a lazily spinning ceiling fan that stirs the warm summer air. Children play in the park across the street, laughing and spinning around in the grass while bees buzz lazily in the nearby flower patches. Retirees walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on skateboards and nodding politely at the teenage girls chatting by the playground equipment. There's a sushi place in a nearby strip mall with affordable food, a swimming supply store right next door, and a nail salon nestled in between. You can get your pool filled for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken - a true strip mall experience. A frozen yogurt shop is also nearby, where teens often grab a cold treat while showing off their skateboarding skills and vaping because they think it's the coolest.\n\nThis neighborhood is a quintessential piece of American history, a small town in the south where time seems to stand still and nothing much changes.",
            "We were driving through an endless expanse of cornfields as she gazed out at the horizon in awe. \"Where are we?\" she asked, taken aback by the vast open space. I chuckled, knowing she'd be shocked by the stark contrast to her hometown where the grocery store was just a stone's throw away. I shared with her what it was like growing up in rural Ohio, where the cornfields stretched as far as the eye could see. In that moment, she finally got a glimpse of who I was and where I came from.\n\nAs we drove down the winding country road, the landscape gave way to a quarry filled with water, and then a small development that was home. The houses were a mix of brick and stucco, each one sprawling across at least half an acre of land that everyone took pride in keeping immaculate. In the spring, flowers bloomed alongside the midwestern trees that changed with the seasons, and the driveways were lined with sleek Mercedes-Benz luxury cars that glistened in the sunlight after a good wash.\n\nAs we turned onto my street, my neighbour, a friendly Korean man, was always outside, tending to his lawn with a song in his heart. He'd spend the entire day mowing, his voice blending in with the hum of his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Everyone in the neighbourhood loved him for his genuine nature and the unique stories he had to share. Though he'd lost some of his wit with age, he was still an amazing person who'd lived a life full of adventure as a doctor.\n\nMy home came into view, and in the side yard, geese waddled about, chased by our mischievous Terrier. Behind the house, a small stream flowed into the quarry, where the sounds of bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional \"moo\" from the nearby farms created a soothing melody. On the other side of the handmade wooden bridge lay a hidden oasis teeming with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. It was my childhood playground, where I spent my days building tree forts, \"hunting\" imaginary prey, and making friends with the kids from the neighbourhood. The winters were harsh, but there was something magical about it. The yard would transform from a lush green to a barren wilderness, and the trees that once bloomed with vibrant flowers would stand as skeletal sentinels of bark. And when snow fell, a winter wonderland would appear overnight, complete with snow angels and snowmen crafted by my little sister. We'd engage in fierce snowball fights, building massive forts to house our arsenal of branches. It was our own little world, where nothing else mattered, and we were just carefree kids.",
            "First off, to truly grasp the essence of Portland, Oregon, one must understand the meaning behind \"weird\". The phrase, which adorns a building that serves multiple purposes like a pizza joint, bar, music venue, and more, is an unofficial town slogan that goes by \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, it's a nostalgic call to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's - a time when the city was less known and less crowded, fostering unique and creative subcultures. To others, it's an invitation to visit a place where being called \"weird\" is considered a badge of honor.\n\nDespite the influx of affluent Californians and the rise of condominiums, Portland still maintains its offbeat charm. Being \"weird\" in Portland doesn't necessarily mean accepting anything, but rather embracing differences that are often shunned by society. We're not immune to modern conveniences and conflicts like the rest of the country, as we import most of our goods from China. However, there are countless ways to be \"weird\" or \"not normal\" in Portland, and we have our fair share of normalcy too. You'll find yoga enthusiasts, hipsters, and business professionals living alongside the rest of us.\n\nPerhaps what makes Portland truly \"weird\" is that we don't take ourselves too seriously. In my neighborhood, like many others, you'll spot colorful houses, vibrant home gardens, and free boxes lining the streets during the summer months. Free boxes typically contain items people are getting rid of, but they can be anything from clothes and books to unexpected treasures. The thrill of discovering something valuable in a free box is a big part of what makes Portland special, and it's a feeling that's unique to each neighborhood in the city.\n\nPortland has its quirkiness, and I'm just one example of the many weird and wonderful residents here. Some people I live among wouldn't dream of rummaging through boxes on the sidewalk, opting instead for activities like goat yoga or cheering on the city's soccer team at a Timbers match. What I love about Portland is its diversity - people here pursue their passions, whether it's starting a business, playing music, or simply enjoying a cold beer at the bar.\n\nOf course, like any city, Portland has its problems. We struggle with a drug issue that often stems from underlying mental health issues, and the constant rain doesn't help. We also have a homelessness problem that's a challenge to solve, with services that are insufficient but still better than in many other parts of the country. The non-homeless population is torn between feeling empathy and frustration towards the homeless. In this regard, Portland is not so \"weird\" after all.",
            "The mountains stand tall, a constant presence in the north, silently witnessing the passage of time as the sun rises and sets each day. Irrespective of how engrossed I am in work or life, they persist, unyielding to the ebbs and flows of life's turmoil. On days when I'm overwhelmed with stress and anxiety, they beckon me, and when I turn to them, they offer a respite, lending me the strength to carry on, one day at a time. It was during my undergraduate days that I first discovered their allure. While the university campus boasts its own share of breathtaking views, the mountains that lie to the north of the campus have an enduring hold on my heart. The university's charm, with its beautiful buildings, ponds, and trees, has won a part of my affection, but it's the mountains that hold the top spot. The rest of the town is equally captivating, with its array of quaint cafés where I spent countless hours fueled by caffeine and determination. A short walk or bus ride takes you to the downtown area, where the faded brick facades transport you to a bygone era, infusing the air with an aura of antiquity. Amidst this blend of suburban tranquility and urban vigor, the town presents a unique charm, an invitation to explore. The juxtaposition of these contrasting atmospheres within close proximity creates a captivating essence, as if beckoning me to uncover its secrets. With time, I've accumulated numerous cherished memories, each tied to a specific part of town, whether it's walking past the rusted swings in the park after a sleepless night with friends or racing through the bustling downtown to catch a movie that the university had provided tickets for. Alas, life has also bestowed upon me numerous harsh memories, a universal aspect of our experiences. The ponds, in particular, have come to serve as a poignant reminder of my introspective moments, as well as the many tears I've shed in the dead of night, grappling with existential crises. While watching the turtles, ducks, and insects live their lives, each with a role to play, I couldn't help but ponder my own purpose as I navigated the complexities of life. As I strolled past the pond, the park, and the quaint houses that epitomize suburban life, I eventually reached the main street, where the sun's rays danced across the palm trees, casting a kaleidoscope of colors across the sky. In that moment, as I gazed up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. And there they were – the mountains, steadfast and resolute, their presence speaking volumes, stirring within me a sense of resilience.",
            "Bensonhurst, Brooklyn - it's no secret that finding your way here is a breeze, thanks to the excellent public transportation system that's as accessible as it is convenient. As one of New York City's most popular forms of transportation, you'll find it easy to get around. With Bensonhurst being a bustling urban neighborhood, you'll still get that quintessential NYC vibe. During your visit, get ready to be surrounded by the numerous Asian stores that seem to be on every corner. It's no coincidence that this neighborhood has become a hub for Asian inhabitants over the past two decades, which is reflected in the abundance of Asian-owned stores. Supermarkets and laundromats are the most popular, and for good reason - they offer top-notch food, unbeatable prices, and unparalleled convenience. Just a stone's throw away from where I am, there are no less than four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walking distance from each other, making grocery shopping a total cinch.\n\nDon't get me wrong, Bensonhurst isn't a sea of Asian faces - it's a melting pot of cultures, with immigrants and their American-born children calling the neighborhood home. The majority of local businesses are still Asian-owned, though, and it's not uncommon to see families and friends of all ages enjoying the vibrant atmosphere. Just a short walk away, you'll find a newly renovated park that's a gem of the neighborhood. With ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for the summer months, there's something for everyone. As you'd expect in New York City, the park is a haven for diversity, and people of all ages and backgrounds come together to play and socialize.\n\nIn terms of housing, you won't find any large corporate buildings here - instead, co-op living and condominium apartments are the norm, with most residents calling two-family houses home. While the majority of people are friendly and welcoming, be prepared for some noise pollution. You'll often hear cars blasting their music, or people flooring it down the road, which can be a bit jarring. If you're visiting at night, it's a good idea to keep your wits about you - while Bensonhurst is generally a safe neighborhood, you never know when you might encounter someone looking for trouble. I've had my own run-ins with bullies and package thieves, but these incidents were a while back. Just remember to keep your shoes clean and be mindful of your surroundings!",
            "My home is nestled at the top of a steep hill, and I'm surrounded by a neighborhood with a unique landscape. People often call it the \"workout hill\" because joggers love to tackle the incline. Since there are no sidewalks, everyone walks on the road, which is a bit hazardous with its potholes and uneven surface. The street's lined with worn-out telephone and electric wires, which are frequently damaged by falling branches and debris from the many storms we get. Evergreen trees abound, but surprisingly, most people here dislike them, as they obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many houses are built high up on the hill, with large glass windows to take in the stunning view of the bay. Watching the sunset is breathtaking, with the water glowing from below and the sky turning orange. However, it's often cloudy, so the sunlight's filtered through a haze. The atmosphere's usually overcast and damp, which contributes to the lush growth of moss on everything – roofs, cars, and even railings. I once left my car in the driveway for a month, and when I returned, it was covered in a thick layer of moss that took me three hours to scrub off. Our neighborhood's relatively quiet, with only a few kids around, thanks to a school nearby. The majority of residents are retired folks, and instead of kids, we have plenty of dogs roaming around. It's not uncommon to see them lounging in people's lawns or racing down the street. If you leave a door or window open, they might sneak in, like when I once found one lounging in my living room and had to shoo it out. Rabbits are also abundant, and they love to dig up plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats have helped keep them under control, though. We also have a variety of birds, including small sparrows and hummingbirds, and occasionally, a hawk or eagle will swoop by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. While we don't have any stores nearby, a short hike down to the waterfront leads to a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. The beach itself isn't extensive, but the rocks along the shore make for fun skipping stones into the water. On most days, you can see the opposite shoreline clearly through the mist.",
            "I've been living in a typical suburban area in a small town in Tennessee for a while now. Our street is situated between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic than I'd like, but other than that, it's a pretty quiet neighborhood. We're not used to having many new faces around here, so I've gotten to know most of the regulars. Folks usually spend their time tending to their lawns and daily chores. In the winter, we enjoy sledding down the hill on our side street. Since we live in a house at the corner of our street, we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that roll through here. Whenever we spot a strange vehicle, we tend to take notice. Some of the neighbors like to take a stroll for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids are always out on their bikes, and you can hear the usual sounds of a small town. As we work from home, we're mostly at home, along with my wife and our two daughters, ages eleven and fourteen. So, it's no surprise that everyone else is used to seeing us come and go. We enjoy spending time outdoors, even when it's raining, and sometimes we fire up the grill on our back deck, filling the air with the delicious smell of barbecue. You can almost always hear the sound of lawn mowers from March to October, when the grass finally stops growing. Our neighborhood used to be wooded, so there are plenty of trees providing shade, but that also means raking and burning leaves every year in the Fall. I must admit, the smell of burning leaves is one of my favorites – it's a sure sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not had much of a Winter, so it feels like it's been one long Fall. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone knocks on the door, which is a rare occurrence. I like to tinker with my truck or other projects in the garage, and when the doors are open, it feels like I'm more connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, things are pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving and other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas bring some extra visitors, and you can spot more cars parked along the street. All in all, I'm quite happy living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "Yesterday, I found myself pondering about my neighborhood, situated smack dab in the middle of the high desert. The endless expanse of brown dirt stretches out before me, a constant reminder of the harsh yet beautiful environment I call home. Unless you've experienced living here firsthand, it's hard to comprehend the monotony of gazing out at the same dull landscape day in and day out. But when you do chance upon a well-manicured lawn, you know that person has invested a small fortune in lawn care. I've lived in this area since the 90s, and although the houses have sprouted up around me, the layout still feels largely the same. In fact, it's a bit eerie how much this place resembles a city, yet, like many other places, it's undergoing rapid transformation. The locals are generally friendly, but, just like any city, there's a mix of the good and the not-so-good. I'm surrounded by friendly elderly folks, which makes my neighborhood feel like a nicer community. The local stores are mostly chain stores, like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final, but if you're looking for upscale options, you're better off traveling elsewhere. I rarely see any Whole Foods or boutiques around here. The dominant industries in my city appear to be construction, given its relatively underdeveloped state and the abundance of open spaces waiting to be built upon. This thought unsettles me, as I prefer things the way they are now. I left behind a big city and don't fancy going back. My full-time job is in the construction field, specifically as a drywall and T-bar installer, which means I'm somewhat invested in its growth. What I appreciate about my home, however, is the unique wildlife. People flock to the high desert for its breathtaking beauty, and the challenging ecosystems it supports have created an opportunity for various species to thrive. It's essential for human residents to learn about and respect the non-human inhabitants of this environment to coexist peacefully. My family and I have adapted well to the wildlife, and my kids are particularly fascinated by lizards and desert bugs. As I write this, they're outside, trying to catch different specimens. As for attractions, we have a few gems. Victorville is a great destination for families looking to experience the desert, and if you plan your visit to coincide with the annual San Bernardino County Fair, you'll have a fantastic time. The fair offers an excellent mix of activities and fun, showcasing the Victorville way. If you're looking for a winter sports fix, head over to Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and take a lesson or two. Lastly, the Victor Valley Museum is a treasure trove of geological, paleontological, and Native American artifacts that provide valuable insights into the history and development of the high desert ecosystem.",
            "My neighborhood might sound like everyone else's, but trust me, it's unique. Unlike others who probably live in their own individual houses, I consider my neighborhood to be the campus I'm on and the people in my dormitory as my community. The surrounding campus is part of my neighborhood too, although it's not as central as the dorm. Despite being a bit unusual, my neighborhood shares some familiar traits with the typical idea of a neighborhood. Just like any normal neighborhood, it's got houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's dive into the 'houses' that make up my neighborhood. Before I do, I need to clarify the types of houses we have here. There are three kinds: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory houses. Apartments usually have 2-4 people in each room, with 4-6 rooms per floor, and about 20 people in each building. The actual houses are a bit rare, with 2-4 bedrooms, mostly occupied by alumni. Then there are the dorm rooms, where hundreds of students live, with each room housing 2 people, except in some cases. They're the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. Now, let's talk about the people. My school is proud of its diversity, and it shows in the neighborhood. You'll find people from all cultures and ages here. Professionals usually live in the houses, while new students are in dorms, and older students are in apartments. We can't do the people justice, so let's move on to the stores and park. Since my school is a mini-neighborhood, it has plenty of stores and a single park. The stores offer a mix of dining options and the school's unique brand of clothes and groceries. You can find anything you need within our neighborhood's boundaries. The park is our playground, kept clean and safe by everyone in the community.",
            "I've been living in this neighborhood for about 10 years now, so I guess it's time for me to share some stories about it. When I first moved here from Riverdale to Stockbridge, I was pretty sad because I missed my old home and the people I loved. My mom and dad made the tough decision to move us to a better neighborhood for a better life, a better school, and a safer environment. It wasn't easy, but I eventually got used to it and made some new friends, as well as some new enemies in school. To be honest, I never really got to know my neighbors that well, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and to a lesser extent, Dennis, who lived right next door. They've been like a family to me, and I feel grateful for having them in my life. I remember attending Mr. Glen's wedding, which was a great experience, and something I hope to replicate in my own life someday. When Ms. Veda threw off her prosthetic leg strap during the wedding, I managed to catch it, but unfortunately not the flowers. We danced the night away, and I had a blast with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I've lost touch with her since, but I hope she's doing well. The neighborhood can be confusing, but now that I have a GPS, I've been exploring it more. I've hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis a few times, and we used to spend hours playing video games and enjoying life. I also love visiting the park and appreciating nature, which helps me feel more calm and at peace. I often take sticks from Home Depot and practice my balance, and I enjoy wielding my bokken wooden sword. There are also a basketball and tennis court nearby, although I haven't played either sport in a while. My dad used to coach me and my best friend in tennis with Mr. Graves, and those were some of the best times. They pushed us hard, but we always had fun. Looking back, I've had a lot of fun in this neighborhood, and there are plenty of stories I could share, but these are the ones that stand out to me. I'm excited to see what the future holds.",
            "I'm really lucky to be living near the college I attend, and I think that's one of the best things about where I live. My neighborhood is pretty chill, with mostly apartment buildings and a few fun, affordable bars and restaurants to hang out at. One of the bars has just changed its name, but it's still not too pricey and the service and drinks are alright. Most of the people around here are either students or lower-income folks who can afford the apartments, which is pretty cool. You can hear the sound of kids playing since there's an elementary school nearby, within walking distance of my place. To be honest, I don't really know my neighbors - they're a bit too into smoking weed, and the management installed an air freshener unit right outside their door, which my boyfriend and I thought was pretty funny. It's almost like they're trying to send a message. The buildings around me are a bit old-fashioned, but they might have been renovated on the inside. Down the street, there are brand new apartments, but I'm not a fan - they're super cheaply built but the rent is way too high, which I think is just taking advantage of people. Since they're close to campus, though, the management gets away with it. There's this one super cheap eatery about a 5-minute walk from my place that only serves food on paper plates and most of their dishes are microwaved. Across from that is a gas station that's not exactly the best place to work. But thanks to some city funding, they redid the road last summer, so now we have a nice big sidewalk, some grass on the median and the sides, and the area looks a lot nicer. The apartment building I live in has a lot of trees around it, but they cut some down, so now there are a few stumps left. There are way more trees where I live than down the street. Behind my apartment complex is a line of trees and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street, which isn't as nice. The sidewalks are in bad shape and the buildings look pretty shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but I think they're just trying to hide the state of the buildings. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but I don't blame them entirely - there are other apartments across the street with their own problems and a pretty transient population. Despite all this, I really like where I live. It's affordable, and there are plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially love that the university is within walking distance, and there are two bus stops so I can easily get to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood is a haven of colorful duplexes nestled in a cul-de-sac. The houses are spread out in a way that makes them seem like individual homes, with only one notable difference - each one is painted a cheerful yellow, adorned with white porches and green metal roofs. While not everyone is close friends, there's a sense of camaraderie that permeates the air. On some evenings, you'll find us gathered at the end of a driveway, chatting and laughing as the kids play with their toys, sidewalk chalk, or fly their kites. It's a refreshing escape from the hustle and bustle of the modern world, a step back in time when life was simpler. The surrounding fields and trees are a stunning backdrop, set against a brilliant blue sky with puffy white clouds. However, this season has brought a new challenge - tornado warnings, which recently culminated in our first-ever experience of actual sirens blaring, prompting us to seek shelter. I was huddled in my bathtub with my smallest dog and some essentials, while my bigger dog stayed put in the living room, anxious and barking. The neighborhood was eerily quiet, except for the sound of large hail pounding the ground. After the storm, the temperature dropped dramatically, and the road was suddenly steaming hot. The hail melted instantly on the pavement as the sun broke through the clearing skies and a double rainbow appeared. I dashed inside to grab my camera and snapped some pictures to share with my friends and family on Facebook - they were as amazed as I was. It took about an hour for the streets to return to normal, and soon the familiar sounds of mom's cooking and children's laughter filled the air. I've grown to love this friendly community, especially the warm Southern accents that fill the air. My two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment is just like everyone else's on the outside, but each one has its unique character on the inside. It's puzzling why some apartments are so small, but it's a minor quirk in an otherwise idyllic setting. I adore strolling through the vast field behind my home, meandering down to the pond that's not meant for swimming. I've spotted deer and even heard the majestic bullfrog's morning serenade. It's a fantastic place to live, just a 40-minute drive from the city of Charlotte. Every morning begins with the cheerful sound of roosters crowing from the nearby farms, creating a sense of community that's hard to find in the city. We even have a friendly donkey at a nearby farm that brays in the evening, reminding us of its presence. I feel lucky to have discovered this hidden gem of a neighborhood.",
            "I stepped into my new neighborhood just as I was about to enter the world of eighth grade. At first, it was tough to connect with the locals, but fate had other plans, and I formed a bond with a guy living right next door and another fellow on my street. Although they're no longer around, the memories remain vivid. The people who were here when I first arrived are still here, giving our neighborhood a sense of continuity. Our neighborhood is just like any other American suburban neighborhood, with rows of two-story houses lining the streets. You can hear the sound of kids playing outside on weekends or whenever the sun is out, and the neighborhood is generally quiet on most weekdays. I've never had any issues with my neighbors, and I feel like I can trust them completely. When I order packages online, they always arrive safely on my porch. Our neighborhood is the kind of place where you're left alone unless you need help.\n\nJust a minute or two away from my house is a park that holds a special place in my heart. I've spent countless hours playing basketball, football, and baseball there with the guys from the neighborhood. One of my not-so-fond memories also happened there when I got elbowed in the nose during a football game, but the good times far outweigh the bad. Nowadays, I visit the park with my cousin's kids, who are a lot younger and still enjoy the simple joys of swings and slides. Just thinking about heading to the park gets them excited. The park is now a source of nostalgia for me, reminding me of the good old days.\n\nOur neighborhood is a melting pot of cultures, with a wide variety of food options nearby. Within a one-mile radius, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, with the rise of food delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash, many people prefer to have their meals delivered to their doorstep. The most popular food places are the fast food chains, but you can find those in many suburban neighborhoods. There are also plenty of pizza places to choose from. Our stores have everything you need, with multiple dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store on the same street. Some stores even cater to different tastes, like an Indian-owned store for those who want to cook up some homemade Indian dishes or buy pre-made meals.\n\nI'm grateful for my neighborhood, especially after reading about the horror stories of people dealing with difficult neighbors on social media. It's a blessing to have a community like mine.",
            "My hometown is a quaint little place in South Carolina, blending seamlessly into the rest of the landscape. It's not particularly famous, but it's made its mark in the agricultural sector, thanks to its status as the Peach Capital of the World, proudly displayed on the town's welcoming sign. The town is primarily composed of vast farmlands dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses on the outskirts of town are spaced far apart, mostly two-story structures with metal roofs to shield them from the scorching summer heat or gray shingles. Most homes are nestled away from the main road, allowing the front fields to be used for raising animals or growing crops. Downtown, the town's single traffic light hangs at a four-way intersection, marking the spot where the local stores are concentrated. There are a few eateries where you can grab fast food: Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a local family; Fiesta Mexican Restaurant; or Gary's, a small burger chain. A pizzeria once called the town home, but it closed its doors a while back. The Maxwell and Halford Drug pharmacy is a family-owned business, and it's famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola; not many people know that, though. IGA, a small, pricey grocery store, is the only one in town, but many residents prefer to shop at a Walmart in the nearby Batesburg-Leesville for most of their grocery needs. Dollar General, however, is the most popular spot in town, offering a wide range of everyday items and bustling with activity from opening to closing. Possibilities Furniture & More, a quaint furniture store run by a well-respected woman in the community, has been a part of the town for years and even employs two movers to deliver purchased furniture. Next door, Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a small pet groomer, offers various services, including daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and more. The town has two small medical practices, one for humans and one for animals, located outside the main part of town. Johnston Elementary School is the town's only elementary school, and students usually move on to middle and high school in the next town over after completing fifth grade. Although there aren't any parks in town, the local government is in the process of creating a 2.5-acre recreational area to provide families with more opportunities to spend time together and attract new residents. It's a quiet town, with limited entertainment options – no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or \"hangout\" spots, but it's a nice place, so small it's easy to miss while driving by.",
            "I first heard about my neighborhood through a podcast featuring people who'd gone missing in the area. It was quite surprising to hear. Almost every apartment in the place was renting for over a thousand dollars a month – something none of my friends and I had ever heard about. I guess that's what happens when you're struggling. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night due to financial burdens. We've learned to be frugal over the years, though. You start to appreciate the dusty smell of second-hand toys and mothballed clothes. As you grow older, you come to notice you smell less as well. Some people might start smoking, while others just get accustomed to the state of things. However, the flea market always finds a way to assert itself. The smell of adulthood is that of dusty magazines piled on a closed piano, which even persists after you wash it. In my area, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start from the far side, you can visit two charity thrift stores, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling with cars and people every morning, but you'd never hear the noise in the thrift stores. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the stores remain quiet. It's a great place to lose an afternoon. Every year, the downtown area gets more crowded with cars and people. It's a growing city, they say. One of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery is based here, and it's still showing signs of growth pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is focused on their own goals, and people generally don't pry into one another's lives. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. This is different from the South, where being a little concerned means showing you care. Here, people respect your personal space and won't intrude unless you invite them to. It's a lively and welcoming place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment full of strangers and more of a community of friends who come together for our needs, celebrate our birthdays, mourn our losses, and help each other when we can. I'm fortunate to live here. I quite like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I try to clean up after myself and leave food for them, and they do the same for me. I bring their mail and they bring mine. It's nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. Despite living in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl, it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I haven't completely messed up my life.",
            "I live in a typical suburban area that looks like it's been cut out from a cookie cutter. You can't help but notice the presence of a homeowner's association when you first enter the neighborhood. The streets are filled with well-maintained single-family homes, all thanks to the HOA's hard work. The front yards are almost identical, with a small patch of grass, some decorative pebbles, and short driveways. You'll occasionally spot small trees and two-car garages. As you drive through the neighborhood, you'll notice newly paved concrete roads with no potholes in sight. Most houses are single-story, but some have two stories. One thing that stands out is the mailbox system – instead of individual mailboxes in front of each house, there's a large group of mailboxes at the end of the street, and you need a key to access your specific one. There are also two larger lockers for packages. The HOA's love for uniformity is really evident here. My house is located on the outskirts of the nearby city, so my neighborhood feels like a mix of rural and suburban areas. As a result, we have plenty of space for everything – there are multiple community pools that are well-maintained and gated, as well as walking trails where you can take your dog or go for a solo evening stroll. You don't even need to go to a park to get some exercise; just take a run around the neighborhood and you'll get enough. The community is mostly made up of retired people, but we also have a few middle-aged and young professionals living here. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for each other. We have a small town feel despite being part of a larger city, and we have most of the amenities you'd expect – except for one mall, which is surprisingly sufficient. It takes around 15 minutes to drive to anywhere significant, but once you get there, you have access to a variety of stores, from high-end grocery stores to bargain outlets. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty standard – we have our perks, like pools and walking trails, but we're not exactly next door to a shopping district, so you just hop in the car and head to any major chain store you want.",
            "Living in a small Midwestern town just outside the city's suburbs has its unique charm. Our neighborhood on the town's east side, where I reside, is often regarded as the most economically disadvantaged area. Property values are low, with many homes rented or owned by low-income families, yet this doesn't define the community's character. The friendly neighbors I've encountered smile and greet me as I walk down the street, giving our area a welcoming atmosphere.\n\nWhile crime rates are slightly higher than in other parts of town, they remain relatively low. Unfortunately, there have been a few violent incidents nearby, including shootings and a homicide, which shook our community. Our next-door neighbors suffered a personal loss when their son was killed outside a local bar. Fortunately, our family has been spared from direct harm, apart from occasional incidents of theft when we forget to bring items inside.\n\nThe town as a whole has been heavily impacted by the opioid epidemic, which has ravaged many parts of the United States. The loss of lives due to fentanyl overdoses has been devastating. Thankfully, our town has made efforts to combat this crisis through addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected.\n\nDespite these challenges, our town has many redeeming qualities. My son's elementary school boasts an exceptional staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff, creating a positive and supportive environment. His special needs haven't hindered his experience, and he loves attending school. The active Parent-Teacher Organization (PTO) organizes numerous events to foster family involvement and educational growth.\n\nGiven that over 20% of our town's population lives below the poverty line, the elementary school offers free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. The school's inclusive atmosphere treats every child and family with dignity, regardless of their financial situation. Costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are also reasonable, making education accessible to all.\n\nThe City Council and staff have made significant improvements to the town's appearance, including repaving roads, landscaping, and renovating city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have focused on the town's center and west side, where shopping areas and major traffic flow. The east side, where I reside, tends to be neglected, a point of contention for our community.\n\nDespite these issues, I genuinely appreciate living in this town. The residents are friendly, the schools excel, and we have a variety of shopping options to meet our needs. Our home may not be worth much, but it's comfortable and sufficient. After 16 years, our family cannot imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood has a rich cultural heritage, situated on a hill surrounded by buildings steeped in history. My apartment is in a 7-story building directly across from an old theater, and just a short walk away is a trendy arcade bar that attracts people of all walks of life on warm summer nights. The crowds flocking to it on weekends in June and July are a common sight. A short distance from there is a sizeable city park, with concrete surrounding its perimeter and tall stairs integrated into the wall. During harsh winter months, homeless individuals set up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and the wide steps, seeking shelter from the cold and rain. They prefer to congregate in the town center rather than in the outskirts, making it easier to stay warm and access nearby amenities like the family center where they can bathe and shower.\n\nWhat I love about my city isn't its historic architecture or the majestic buildings that dot the hills leading down to the ocean. It's the people themselves who bring the neighborhood to life. You see, Hilltop was notorious in the past for its gang violence, with stories of federal officials and the DEA attempting to clean up the streets decades ago still lingering in the air. The community hasn't forgotten, and these tales are passed down through generations, including to newcomers like me. Despite being considered one of the tougher neighborhoods in the city, residents work hard to keep it clean and look out for one another. They care deeply about their community and the issues that affect it.\n\nLocals often advise visitors not to walk around the Hill at night, a warning that I believe is rooted in the past and tainted by social biases. Perhaps I'm able to blend in because of my dark skin, or maybe the Hilltop community recognizes me as one of their own, someone who's acutely aware of the societal issues that plague our nation. These issues include racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions born out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that prides itself as a melting pot Utopia. One thing is certain: no matter where life takes me, Hilltop will always be home. I feel a sense of belonging walking those streets at night, meeting people who offer me a jacket or a helping hand rather than causing harm. It's a place where laundromat owners stay open late to let me charge my phone in the rain, and where strangers have offered me kindness and reassurance on the darkest of nights, making me feel seen and valued.",
            "I reside in Rural America, in a quaint small town in Michigan. The landscape shifts from rolling farmland to charming tourist cities, and you'll notice the absence of large shopping malls, retail giants like Walmart, Target, or even the likes of Applebee's. To get to any place, a drive is often the only option. Interestingly, amidst this rustic setting, my town is blessed with breathtaking natural beauty, surrounded by two majestic lakes: beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and the serene Lake Charlevoix on the other. Every direction you look, you'll find a picturesque beach perfect for dipping your toes. The neighborhood I call home embodies the essence of a small town. The houses are not cookie-cutter developments, but rather older, unique homes that reflect the character of the area. Some have been lovingly updated and remodeled, while others retain their original charm. Many of these homes boast spacious basements that are visible from the street, and the neighborhood is dotted with a kaleidoscope of colors, thanks to the diverse range of aluminum siding used on the houses. Yards are a common feature, complete with trampolines, playsets, and gardens, while some homes are fenced to keep pets safe. The atmosphere is quintessentially Midwestern, with hardworking families who value tradition and community. On any given day, you'll see kids playing in the streets, people walking their dogs, biking, or rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors, and you can easily spot those who fit in and those who don't. The sense of community is palpable, with friendly waves and warm smiles exchanged between residents. The lawns are well-maintained, with neatly trimmed grass and tidy gardens. It's not a neighborhood that screams \"look at me,\" but rather one that exudes a sense of warmth and welcoming familiarity. Our town is a haven, a place where families can feel safe and secure. Within walking distance, you'll find the county sheriff's department and jail, as well as the local health department and recycling center, which serve the community with dedication. The nearby baseball and softball fields are a hub of activity, with the sound of announcers calling out scores and player names filling the air. Our small-town airport is also nearby, adding to the area's charm. You can walk to get ice cream from the local parlor, or stroll downtown, which is just a short distance away. My kids can easily ride their bikes to the nearby park, which is just a few blocks away. This is a truly wonderful place to call home."
