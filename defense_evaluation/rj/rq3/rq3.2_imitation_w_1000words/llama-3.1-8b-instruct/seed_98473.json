            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

Yet, my neighborhood and many others still stand as a testament to that dream, holding onto it as tightly as we can. The people here don't feel as optimistic as they used to; the upkeep of the lawns isn't what it once was, but you can still spot a car or two in every driveway, and the youth still play as if nothing's wrong.

            "At first glance, it may seem like just any other residential area - tucked away behind a shopping strip, it's not a place you'd expect to find a thriving community. But look closer, and you'll discover an entire world hidden behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and the hotels that are only occasionally occupied except for family reunions during the summer. Behind these buildings lies a bustling neighborhood, complete with a series of apartment complexes side by side like Russian nesting dolls carefully arranged on the street.

            "As we cruised past the endless cornfields which stretched as far as my eyes could see, she asked, \"Where is everything?\" I knew she'd be taken aback by the bare expanses of open land. Coming from a town where the nearest grocery store was just a 5-minute walk away, she'd never experienced this much space before. I filled her in on what it was like growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood me and where I'm from. We drove along a two-lane country road, passing by a quarry filled with water before reaching my small development. The houses here are mostly brick and stucco, each with a lush half-acre of land that the residents take great pride in maintaining. Come spring, the annual flowers bloom alongside the midwestern trees that change with the seasons. The driveways are lined with sleek Mercedes-Benz luxury cars, glistening in the sunlight after a good wash.

Everyone in the neighborhood loves him for his genuine and unique personality. He's aged and lost some of his wit, but his past as a doctor is still evident. As we continued down the road, I showed her the side yard, where geese roam free and are chased by our feisty Terrier.

            "To truly grasp the essence of Portland, Oregon, one must first understand what being \"weird\" truly means. The unofficial town motto, proudly plastered on a building that defies categorization as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, and strip club, all while skirting the law, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, this phrase is a nostalgic reminder of the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's - a lesser-known, more affordable city that fostered unique and creative subcultures. For others, it's an invitation to come to Portland, where the term \"weird\" is now a badge of honor. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the relentless construction of high-rise condos to accommodate them, Portland remains stubbornly eccentric. Being weird doesn't mean being judgmental or exclusive, but rather accepting of things that wouldn't normally be accepted. We have our modern amenities and our share of modern issues, just like the rest of the country - we import most of our goods from China. There are countless ways to be weird, to be unconventional, but Portland has its fair share of the ordinary. You'll find yoga enthusiasts, hipsters, and suit-and-tie professionals living alongside one another. Perhaps \"weird\" simply means we don't take ourselves too seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, you'll find vibrant houses, home gardens bursting with flowers, herbs, and vegetables, and free boxes lining the streets during the summer months. Free boxes are essentially discarded items - often cardboard, sometimes plastic - containing treasures perfect for the passerby. They can hold anything from clothes and books to who-knows-what, and the thrill of the hunt is all part of the magic. This is what Portland is all about to me, but I'm just one of the many weird and wonderful souls that call this city home. Some people I live among would never dream of scavenging through a box on the sidewalk, opting instead for goat yoga or Timbers matches. Portland is a city of people with diverse passions and pursuits - we're a city of dreamers, both those who are actively chasing their dreams and those who spend too much time at the bar, lost in thought. Of course, like every city, Portland struggles with its fair share of problems, including a drug epidemic that often stems from underlying mental health issues. The constant rain and grey skies don't help, but neither do we. We also grapple with homelessness, a complex issue that seems to plague every major city in the country. Our social services are better than many other places, but they're still woefully insufficient. The non-homeless population is torn between empathy and frustration, and in this, we're not at all weird - just like any other city facing similar challenges.",
            "The mountains have been consistent witnesses to the passage of time, silently standing tall in the north as the sun rises and sets each day. They remain steadfast, unperturbed by life's turmoil, and unwavering in their presence. Even when I'm consumed by work and life's demands, they're there, always a constant in my life. On days when I'm feeling overwhelmed and drained, they beckon me to take a step back and rest my anxious soul, offering me the strength to carry on, day by day. It was during my undergrad days that I first fell in love with the mountains north of campus. While the university itself boasts its own unique charm, with its beautiful buildings, ponds, and trees, it's the mountains that hold a special place in my heart. Beyond the campus, the town itself has its own beauty. There are numerous cozy cafes where I spent countless hours fuelled by caffeine and cramming, and just a short walk away lies the downtown area, where the faded brick buildings exude an air of antiquity. This blend of old and new, bustling and serene, creates a captivating atmosphere that invites exploration. As a result, I've created many cherished memories in this town, each tied to a specific location. Whether it's strolling past the rusty swings in the park with friends after a long night of studying or racing through the downtown area to catch a movie in the university's cinema, this town has been a witness to many moments of joy and laughter. However, it's also a place of painful memories, as is true with any place in life. The ponds, in particular, have become a refuge for both reflection and late-night tears during moments of existential crisis. As I watch the turtles, ducks, and insects living their lives, each contributing to the ecosystem, I'm reminded of my own search for purpose. And so, I'd walk past the pond, the park, and the small houses that epitomize suburban life, until I reached the main street. It was then that I'd gaze up at the sunrise, and as the palm trees stood tall beneath it, I'd feel the warmth of the sun's rays. That's when I'd look north and see them: the sturdy, majestic mountains, their peaks grazing the hazy blue and yellow sky. In that moment, they'd stir something deep within me, a sense of resilience that has guided me through life's challenges.",
            "Bensonhurst is quite easy to find if you're planning on visiting. The public transportation system is very accessible, making it one of the most popular modes of transportation in New York City. As you walk through the neighborhood, you'll get a true taste of the city vibe. You'll see a plethora of Asian stores all around, which are a result of the influx of Asian inhabitants over the past two decades. It's not uncommon to spot an Asian-owned store on almost every block. Supermarkets and laundromats are particularly popular, not just among locals but also among visitors, thanks to their affordable prices, high-quality food, and convenient locations. In fact, I'm lucky enough to have four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk of each other, making grocery shopping a breeze. While Bensonhurst is predominantly Asian, it's not homogeneous – you'll find a mix of immigrants, first-generation and second-generation American kids, and a diverse community. The majority of big businesses in the area are Asian-owned, but you'll also find a beautifully renovated park nearby, complete with ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, a playground, and a water fountain for kids to enjoy during the summer. The park is a melting pot of diversity, where people from different backgrounds can come together and get along. When it comes to living spaces, you won't find many high-rise corporate buildings. Instead, you'll see co-op living buildings and condominium apartments, with two-family houses being the most common type of residence. While the people here are generally nice, they can be quite loud. You'll often hear cars blasting music as they drive by, or people flooring it on the gas, which can make for an early morning wake-up call. If you're planning a night visit, be cautious; while the neighborhood is generally safe, you never know who you might run into. Be prepared to encounter people who might start trouble for no reason, bullies, and even thieves. I've had my own share of run-ins with bullies in the past, but thankfully, it was a long time ago. More recently, there have been cases of package theft in the area. Lastly, be aware that people in this neighborhood don't always follow the rules, like cleaning up after their dogs. You'll often see dog waste on the sidewalk, which can be quite frustrating. Just be careful where you step and make sure to keep your shoes clean!",
            "Where I live, the sidewalks are scarce. It's like everything flows downhill, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest slope in the neighbourhood. They call it the \"workout hill\" because many joggers like to run up it as part of their daily routine. Since there are no sidewalks on my street, people walk on the road. The road itself is pitted in some places and can be a bit hazardous to drive on due to several potholes. The telephone and electric wires strung around the block look tattered, and with the frequent rain and storms, branches and debris often knock them down, requiring constant repairs. As a result, they appear patchwork-y and worn out. The area is filled with tall evergreen trees, but the residents dislike them, viewing them as obstructing the ocean view. To compensate, many houses are built high up on the hill, with large glass-fronted second-storey sections that offer a stunning view of the bay. When the sun sets, the water seems to be lit up from below, and the sky turns a vibrant orange. However, it's cloudy most days, so the sunlight often gets filtered through the haze. The weather is mostly overcast and damp, with moss growing on everything it can, from roofs to cars to railings. I once left my car in the driveway for a month, and when I returned, it had turned green and furry with moss, taking three hours to clean off. My neighbourhood is mostly home to older residents, many of whom are retired. In contrast to children, dogs are a common sight in our area, often seen lounging in people's yards or racing down the street. If you leave a door or window open, they might sneak into your house. I once found one in my living room and had to shoo it out the front door. Rabbits are also rampant in the area, digging up roots and burrowing into lawns, much to the dismay of the gardeners. My cats, however, love them and have managed to hunt most of them out of our neighbourhood. The area is also home to a variety of birds, including small sparrows and hummingbirds, as well as the occasional hawk or eagle that soars by until chased off by the neighbourhood crows. If you're willing to hike downhill to the waterfront, you can find a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. The shoreline itself is narrow, but the rocks along the shore make for fun places to throw stones into the water. The bay is not wide, and on most days, you can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist.",
            "We live in a small neighborhood in a southern Tennessee town, situated on a street that connects two state highways. The traffic can get pretty busy, but overall, it's a quiet and peaceful area. I've gotten used to the familiar faces of my neighbors, who keep busy with yard work and daily chores. In the winter, my family and I sled down the hill on our side street, enjoying the thrill of the ride. Our house is at the front corner of the street, so we see everyone passing by and have a good idea of who lives around here. Whenever a new car appears, we take notice. Some neighbors walk their dogs or exercise, while the kids ride their bikes. We spend a lot of time at home, working from there, and our family of four - my wife, our two daughters (11 and 14 years old) - is pretty used to seeing us come and go. We love spending time outside, even on rainy days, and occasionally we fire up the grill on our back deck, filling the air with the delicious smell of barbecue. The sound of lawn mowers fills the air from March to October, reminding us that the grass is growing. Our neighborhood was once wooded, so we have plenty of shade and beautiful trees, but also a lot of leaves in the fall, which means regular raking and burning. We enjoy the smell of burning leaves, signaling the arrival of fall. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we mainly use the back door, unless someone knocks on the front door, which is a rare occurrence. When I work on my truck or other projects in the garage, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. On holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas, the neighborhood is quiet, except for the occasional visitors and extra cars parked around. It's a great place to live, and if it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "Yesterday, I reflected on my neighborhood in the high desert. It's like being smack in the middle of a vast expanse of dirt, with not a speck of green in sight. People who haven't experienced living here might not grasp the feeling of seeing nothing but brown every time they step out. When I first arrived in the 90s, the houses were scattered far apart. Now, it's the same, with new additions sprouting up everywhere. Our neighborhood is transforming into a city, but it's happening everywhere, not just here. Most people are friendly, but like any urban area, there are good and bad parts. I'm surrounded by friendly seniors, so I feel pretty lucky to live here. The local stores are mostly chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want to find something unique, you have to head elsewhere. Construction is the most prominent industry in our area, and I think it's because this city is still relatively undeveloped, leaving plenty of open space to build. To be honest, it worries me - I prefer things the way they are now. I left the city to escape the chaos and don't want to go back. Speaking of construction, my job as a drywall and T-bar installer is right in this field. What I love about my home is the wildlife. People come to the high desert for its breathtaking beauty, but it also has a unique ecosystem that needs protection. We have a responsibility to learn about the animals that call this place home so we can coexist peacefully. I've got three kids, and they're just like me - they're fascinated by lizards and desert bugs. Right now, they're outside trying to catch different species. As for attractions, we've got a few things to offer. Victorville is a great place for families to experience the desert. If you plan your visit during the San Bernardino County Fair, you'll get a memorable experience. Head to Wrightwood to see the snow-capped mountains and take some winter sports lessons to cap off your trip. If you're interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert, the Victor Valley Museum has an impressive collection of geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of how our community developed and thrived.",
            "To describe my neighborhood, I'd say my answer is pretty one-of-a-kind. While others might think of their neighborhood as a typical residential area, mine's a bit different. For me, my neighborhood is actually the college campus I stay on, and the people in my dorm are like my community. I also consider the surrounding campus as part of my neighborhood, but to a lesser extent. Despite being a bit unconventional, my neighborhood shares some familiar traits with the usual idea of a neighborhood. Like any ordinary neighborhood, it's got houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's start with the 'houses' that make up my neighborhood. Before diving into the specifics, I should clarify the different types of housing in my vicinity. There are three main types: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory houses. First, in the apartments, each room usually has 2-4 people, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor, making each building home to around 20 people. Then, there are the actual houses that are available for rent for those affiliated with the school - usually 2-4 bedroom setups, often occupied by alumni, but there aren't many of these around. Lastly, there are the dorm rooms, which house hundreds of students, typically with two people sharing a room, except in some cases. These are the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered, let's move on to the people. My school's all about diversity, and that's reflected in the mix of cultures and ages living in my neighborhood. The professional staff live in the houses, while newer students stay in dorms and older students stay in apartments. It's hard to do justice to the people in my neighborhood, so let's skip to the stores and parks. Since my school is essentially its own self-contained neighborhood, it has plenty of stores and a single park. The stores offer a mix of dining options and the school's own brand of clothing and grocery stores, so you can find everything you need within the neighborhood. The park's a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, kept clean and safe thanks to everyone's efforts.",
            "I must say that after being here for about a decade, I've got some stories to share. I still remember the day I moved here to this neighborhood, I was really down, coming from Riverdale to Stockbridge. It was tough, I won't deny it, I missed them and the life we had there, but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sis, so we packed up and moved to a new place with better housing and a better high school. It was a big change, but over the years, I got used to it and made some new friends and, unfortunately, some new enemies at school too. One thing that's stuck with me is that I never really took the time to get to know my neighbors, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis, who we were lucky to have living next door. They've been like family to me, and I'm really grateful to have them. I remember when my family and I went to Mr. Glen's wedding; it was an amazing experience, and I'm hoping to have something similar one day when I'm older and settled. When Ms. Veda took off her wedding anklet and threw it, I was quick enough to catch it, but I wish I'd caught the flowers too! We danced the night away, and I had a blast with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I've lost touch with her since, but I hope she's doing great. The neighborhood can be confusing, but now that I have a GPS, it's easier to explore. I've only gone so far, mostly hanging out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We used to spend hours playing video games and living life to the fullest. I'd also head to the park to enjoy nature, which really calms me down and gives me a sense of peace. I'd bring sticks and practice my balance, and sometimes I'd bring my bokken sword if I could. It's great to do what I love. We also have a basketball and tennis court, even though I haven't played either sport in a while, it's good to have them around just in case I decide to pick them up again. My dad got me and my best friend into tennis with Mr. Graves, and we always had a blast, even though they pushed us hard. I'm sure there are plenty of more stories from my time here, but these are the things that really stand out, and who knows, the best is yet to come.",
            "The college that I attend is actually just nearby my place, which I must say I'm pretty fortunate about. I live in an apartment building, but there are a few restaurants and bars around that are pretty cool to hang out at, and they're not too pricey. I recently heard that one of the bars has been renamed, and it's a bit more expensive than the others, but the service and drinks aren't too bad. The people in the area are pretty nice, and since it's a college town, there are mostly students and low-income individuals living in the apartment buildings. You can also tell that there are a lot of families around, probably because there's an elementary school within walking distance from my apartment. I don't really know my neighbors, and to be honest, I don't particularly want to. They smoke a lot of weed, and our apartment management decided to put an air freshener unit right outside their door, which my boyfriend and I found pretty amusing. It's almost as if they're mocking us. The apartment buildings around me are mostly old-looking on the outside, but they might have been renovated inside. A bit further down the street, there are brand new apartments, but I don't really like them. I think the construction quality isn't that great, and the rent is super high, which I think is a bit unfair. Since they're close to the campus, the management of those buildings can get away with charging us exorbitant rent. There's this really cheap restaurant just a few minutes from my place that serves food on paper plates and most of it is microwaved. Across from that place is a gas station, which I've heard isn't a great place to work. However, thanks to some funding from the city, the road was renovated last summer, so now there's a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and the area looks a bit better. But my apartment building is actually pretty shaded, with lots of trees around it. They cut down a few of them, so there are a few stumps left behind, but there are still a lot of trees around my place compared to the other street. Behind my apartment complex is a row of trees, and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind it is 43rd street, and that one's not as nice. The sidewalks on that street are pretty bad and are falling apart, and most of the buildings look pretty run-down. There are a lot of trees on that street, but it's probably just to hide the state of the buildings. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but I don't think it's fair to blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But overall, I like living here. The rent is affordable, and there are plenty of useful amenities nearby, including the university, which is within walking distance, and there are two bus stops so I can easily get to the store and downtown.",
            "My current neighborhood is comprised of rows of duplex's in a cul-de-sac. They appear to be individual houses due to the intermittent placement and spacing, although they are painted the same, with yellow walls, white porches, and green metal roofs. Most of the residents are on friendly terms with one another, which adds to the communal atmosphere. Every evening, some of us stand at the end of our driveways and engage in casual conversations while the kids in the neighborhood play with their toys, create art with sidewalk chalk, or fly their kites. This setting is a refreshing escape from the monotony of the modern world, which is dominated by technology and computers. It's as if we're living in a bygone era. The surroundings are picturesque, with fields and trees accompanied by blue skies and puffy white clouds. However, this season has brought us tornado warnings, and for the first time, we actually heard the tornado sirens last night, prompting us to seek shelter. I, along with my little dog, found myself in the bathtub, clutching my purse and a few pillows. My larger dog, however, remained in the living room, whining and barking nervously due to the unusual circumstances. The neighborhood was eerily quiet, except for the sound of large hail pounding against the ground. After the storm passed, the road was steaming due to the dramatic temperature change, with the hail melting as soon as it hit the hot pavement. As I gazed up at the clearing skies, the sun broke through, and it began to rain. A double rainbow appeared, and I quickly ran inside to grab my camera to capture the moment. I shared the photos with my friends and family on Facebook, and they were just as amazed as I was. The streets remained quiet for another hour before people started returning home, and then it was back to normal – moms and kids outside, dinner being cooked. I've grown to adore this friendly neighborhood, especially the southern accent that's become music to my ears. Although all the houses appear identical on the outside, each apartment has its own unique layout and charm. Some are surprisingly small, which I find hard to understand. I enjoy taking leisurely walks through the largest field behind my home and strolling down to the pond, which isn't suitable for swimming. I've spotted deer, and in the mornings, you can hear the deep, resonant song of the bullfrog. It's a fantastic place to live, just a forty-minute drive away from the city of Charlotte. Each morning is a beautiful start, accompanied by the sounds of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It's as if we're living in a small, self-contained community. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that lets out a distinctive bray in the evenings, serving as a gentle reminder of his presence. I feel fortunate to have found this hidden gem of a neighborhood.",
            "It was my first day of eighth grade when I moved into this neighborhood. Making friends wasn't easy at first, but luckily I connected with two of my neighbors - one living two houses down and another on my street. Unfortunately, they've since moved away, but the memories still linger. To my surprise, most of the original residents who welcomed me when I first arrived are still here. Our neighborhood is pretty much your typical American suburban setup - rows of two-story houses and the usual sounds of kids playing outside on warm days. Weekends are usually pretty quiet, but when it's warm, you can hear the laughter of kids outside. I've been fortunate to have never had any issues with my neighbors, and it's clear that this is a community where you're left alone unless you genuinely need help. Online deliveries have become a norm, and I've ordered multiple times without ever having a package go missing from my porch. This speaks volumes about the trust my neighbors have in each other. A park just a minute or two away has been a hub for some of my fondest memories, including playing basketball, football, and baseball with my neighborhood friends. However, it's also where I suffered a painful injury when I got elbowed in the nose during a football game. The good memories far outweigh the bad, though. Nowadays, I visit the park to spend quality time with my cousin's younger kids, who still love playing on the swings and slides. Watching them brings back a mix of emotions, making me nostalgic for my past experiences there. The neighborhood is a melting pot of cultures, with an array of cuisines nearby. Just within a one-mile radius, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants, as well as plenty of fast-food shops and pizza places. Online food delivery services like GrubHub and DoorDash have become increasingly popular, though. The local stores cater to all our needs, with multiple dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store on the same street. There's even an Indian-owned store for those who crave homemade or ready-made Indian food. After seeing the unfortunate stories of neighborly conflicts on social media and news, I feel grateful to live in a neighborhood where I can trust my neighbors.",
            "My hometown is a charming little town in South Carolina that doesn't stand out from the rest, but it's a significant contributor to the agriculture sector. Johnston claims to be the Peach Capital of the World, a title proudly displayed on the town's welcoming sign. Its main landscape consists of farmland where peach trees and cattle dominate the scene. Houses, mostly two-story affairs with metal or gray roofs to combat the scorching summer heat, are scattered throughout the outskirts of town. They're often set back from the road, allowing the front fields to be used for grazing animals and crops. The central part of town features a single stoplight at an intersection, where the few shops are located. A small Chinese restaurant called Hong Kong, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a local burger chain, offer limited dining options. A former pizzeria has since closed down. There's a small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug, famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola. A tiny grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, is the town's sole grocery store, but many residents prefer to shop at the nearby Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville. However, the most bustling spot in town is Dollar General, which sells a vast array of everyday items and is always crowded from opening to closing. A small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind-hearted woman, has been a staple in Johnston for years and even employs delivery services. Adjacent to the furniture store is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet groomer offering various services. Both a doctor's office and a veterinary clinic are located outside the main town area, providing essential services to the residents. The town has a single elementary school, Johnston Elementary School, but students attend middle and high school in the next town over after completing the fifth grade. Although there aren't many recreational activities, the town is working on creating a 2.5-acre recreational area to attract visitors and potential residents. While it's a quiet town with limited amenities, it's still a pleasant place to live, so small that you could easily miss it in the blink of an eye.",
            "The first time I heard about my neighborhood, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It caught me off guard. Almost every apartment in the area was renting for over a thousand dollars a month, but I'd never heard anything about this story. Neither had my friends. It's like the darkness that settles in when you're struggling. I know some of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night due to financial struggles. We've learned to be thrifty over the years, but it's funny how you start to appreciate the smell of second-hand items and old clothes. You even start to enjoy the smell of stale air. As an adult, you might start smoking or just get used to the way things are. But the thrift stores in my area never fail to remind me of this reality. There are three within walking distance, and if you start from the far end, you'll find charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. The townscape may be chaotic, with cars and people packed into the streets every morning, but the thrift stores are always quiet. It's the perfect place to lose an afternoon. Every year, the city grows more crowded with cars and people. It's a developing city, they say, and it's home to one of the largest e-commerce empires. It reminds me of New York, where everyone's focused on their goals and nobody bothers you. You can keep to yourself, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where people seem to pry into your life. In this city, you can keep your shell intact, and the city will just roll on like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be, with the pianist next door and the amateur vocalists upstairs always creating something new. We don't live in a typical apartment of strangers; instead, we're a community of friends who come together for birthdays, funerals, and when we need help. I'm lucky to be here, and I really like most of my neighbors. We look out for each other, clean up after ourselves, and share food and mail. It's nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. Despite living in a massive modernist sprawl, my neighbors make me feel like I haven't completely messed up my life.",
            "I live in a typical suburban area, nothing out of the ordinary. My neighborhood is like a cookie cutter version of suburban living. Everywhere you look, you'll see well-maintained single family homes, thanks to our homeowner's association. The front yards all share a similar theme: a small patch of neatly cut grass, some decorative pebbles, and short driveways. You'll also spot small trees scattered here and there. Every house has two-car garages. As you drive through the neighborhood, you'll notice newly paved concrete roads in excellent condition – no potholes or bumps in sight. Most of the homes are one-story, but some have two stories as well. What sets our neighborhood apart is the mail system. Instead of individual mailboxes in front of each house, we have a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street that require a key to access. We also have two big package lockers, courtesy of our HOA's love for uniformity. Our neighborhood is on the outskirts of the nearby city, so it's a mix of rural and suburban living. We have plenty of open land and a range of amenities, including multiple community pools that are well-maintained and gated. There are also walking trails where you can take your dog for a walk or go for a solo evening stroll. Exercise isn't a problem here – you can simply run around the neighborhood and get your daily dose of exercise. Our community is predominantly made up of retirees, but we also have a mix of middle-aged and young professionals. The city itself is surprisingly large, with a small-town feel. We have all the amenities you'd expect, including a single mall that may not be huge, but gets the job done. It takes me about 15 minutes to drive to anywhere significant, but once I get there, I have access to a variety of stores, from high-end grocery stores to bargain outlets. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty standard – we have our nice touches like pools and walking trails, and while we're not right next door to any shopping centers, it's an easy drive to get to any major chain store I want.",
            "I reside in a small Midwestern town situated just outside the suburban outskirts of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, located on the east side, is considered the most economically disadvantaged area within the town. Property values are on the lower side, with most houses rented or owned by low-income individuals, yet it's far from unattractive or unpleasant. The people in my neighborhood are generally friendly and always greet me with a smile when I walk down the street. Crime rates are slightly higher than in other parts of town, but still relatively low. In the past decade, a few violent crimes have occurred close to my home, including shootings and a homicide. Our next-door neighbors recently lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar. Fortunately, my family hasn't been directly affected by crime, except for occasionally losing items from our porch when we forget to bring them inside. Our town has been greatly impacted by the \"opioid epidemic\" affecting many parts of the United States. Unfortunately, many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are numerous resources available to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those struggling with addiction. Despite the challenges, my town has many positive qualities. My son's elementary school has an excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. He has special needs, yet he hasn't faced any bullying due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he truly loves attending. We have an active PTO that organizes multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Given that over 20% of our town's population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child ever goes hungry. No child or family is treated as less than due to financial constraints, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are reasonable. The City Council and staff have implemented various improvements to our town's appearance, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the town center and on the west side, where shopping areas are located and most traffic passes through. In contrast, the east side, where I live, tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for my neighbors and me. Despite these issues, I genuinely enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are excellent, there are sufficient shopping options to meet my family's needs, and while our home may not be worth much, it is comfortable and suitable. We've lived here for over 16 years, and it's hard to imagine calling anywhere else home.",
            "My neighborhood is a vibrant cultural hub, nestled on a hill surrounded by buildings steeped in history. I live in a 7-story apartment building right opposite the old theater, and just down the road, you'll find a trendy arcade bar that draws in a diverse crowd on warm summer evenings. The line of people waiting to get in is a common sight, especially during weekends in June and July. A short walk up is the city park, a decent size considering its location. The park is encircled by concrete, with steep stairs carved into the wall. During the harsh winter months, you'll see homeless people setting up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and wide steps. Although it doesn't snow often, the heavy rainfall in mid-winter can be challenging to cope with. By setting their tents close together in the city center, they stay relatively warmer. They're also close to the local family center, where they can access basic necessities like showers and baths. What I love about my city isn't its historic architecture or the hills that roll down to the ocean. It's the people themselves who make my neighborhood so special. You see, Hilltop was once notorious for gang violence on the West Coast, and stories of federal officials and the DEA sweeping through the area still circulate today. The community still remembers those days. Despite being considered one of the rougher neighborhoods in the city, the people work hard to keep it clean and safe. They still care about what happens in their area, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill at night, but I think this warning is a relic of the past, tainted with social conditioning. Perhaps it's because I blend in as a 'not-so-white' person, or maybe the Hilltop community recognizes me as one of their own, someone who's just as aware of the reminders that plague our nation. These reminders are a result of racism, cultural conditioning, and ignorance-fueled assumptions, even in a city that prides itself as a cultural melting pot. I know one thing: no matter where life takes me, Hilltop will always be home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who've shown me kindness and compassion, even when I needed it most. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open late to charge my phone when I was stranded in the rain. It's a place where I've sat, feeling invisible, huddled against a concrete storefront on a bleak night, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I reside in Rural America, a small town in Michigan. The landscape here is a beautiful mix of farmland and quaint tourist cities. We don't have the big city luxuries like malls, chain stores like Wal-mart or Target, or even a fancy restaurant like Applebee's. Everything you need is within driving distance. Despite this, our little town is surrounded by breathtaking natural beauty - the stunning waters of Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Every corner of our \"city\" offers access to a beach where you can dip your toes in the water. Our neighborhood perfectly embodies the essence of small-town life. Houses are spread out, not towering on top of each other like in big cities. They're a mix of old and new, with some homes dating back years and others beautifully renovated. Most houses have full basements that are visible from the road, giving them a charming, down-to-earth feel. The neighborhood is a kaleidoscope of colors, with houses painted in every hue imaginable. Yards are a common feature, with trampolines, playsets, and even gardens and fences for pets. The atmosphere is quintessentially Middle American - hardworking folks striving to make a living, some raising families and others having already done so. On any given day, you'll see kids running up and down the streets, people walking their dogs, biking, or rollerblading. Neighbors know and look out for one another, and you can quickly tell who's part of the community and who's an outsider. You'll see people grilling in their front yards, waving at passersby, or walking their dogs and exchanging pleasantries with neighbors a few blocks away. Lawns are well-maintained, with neatly trimmed grass and tidy gardens. It's not a neighborhood that will leave you awestruck, but one that exudes a sense of comfort and security. It's a quiet, peaceful place where you can feel safe, and that's exactly what people want in life. Within walking distance, you'll find the county sheriff's department, the health department, and the recycling center, which serves the entire city. We have baseball and softball fields nearby, where you can hear the announcers calling out the names of players and keeping score. The small town airport is just a stone's throw away, and you can often hear the sound of small planes taking off and landing. You can also walk to the local ice cream shop or head downtown from our neighborhood. My kids can ride their bikes to the nearby park, which is just an 8-block ride away. It's a wonderful place to call home."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "Yesterday, I pondered the diversity of my neighborhood in this large city.  Residential areas are scattered randomly between commercial ones, where you can find a variety of businesses like offices, stores, restaurants, and entertainment spots. There's no shortage of restaurants to dine at and stores to shop from. While some stores are well-known brands owned by large corporations, others are small boutiques that are increasingly popular. These boutiques line the streets and are within walking distance of quiet neighborhoods that would otherwise be serene. There are also nearby parks where people take their young children to spend quality time. As for the people, my neighborhood is surprisingly diverse. In one small area, you'll find a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a group of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. If you venture out, you'll find even more people from different racial and ethnic backgrounds, although they tend to form their own communities within the city. There are areas known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and more, just a few miles away. However, those few miles can be a lengthy drive due to traffic, especially during rush hour. It's no surprise that hardly anyone walks anywhere in my city. With some attractions within walking distance, the city is huge, and people generally prefer not to commute on foot. As a result, the city is plagued by terrible traffic, and parking spots are scarce. Ironically, there's been a lot of construction lately, with new apartment buildings popping up. It seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are worried that it'll only lead to more people and traffic. My city has a mix of different types of houses, ranging from large apartment buildings to smaller houses and condominiums. Some properties are single-family homes, while others are duplexes. Even within my immediate neighborhood, there's a variety of housing options. The neighborhood is also home to people of all ages, and I must admit that I'm not familiar with most of my neighbors.

            "My neighborhood is an interesting place. It's a mix of single-family homes, though some have been split into two, still connected, if you can imagine that. My house has a small front yard and a driveway to its left, just like most of the others. It's a reminder of the 'American dream,' a concept that once seemed to capture the hearts of this nation, but now seems to be slipping away. Yet, my neighborhood and many others still stand as a testament to that dream, holding onto it as tightly as we can. The people here don't feel as optimistic as they used to; the upkeep of the lawns isn't what it once was, but you can still spot a car or two in every driveway, and the youth still play as if nothing's wrong. Our public school, which has been here for almost 90 years, still stands, inspiring a sense of possibility in the youth and nostalgia in the older residents.

            "At first glance, it may seem like just any other residential area - tucked away behind a shopping strip, it's not a place you'd expect to find a thriving community. But look closer, and you'll discover an entire world hidden behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and the hotels that are only occasionally occupied except for family reunions during the summer. Behind these buildings lies a bustling neighborhood, complete with a series of apartment complexes side by side like Russian nesting dolls carefully arranged on the street. One complex has seen its fair share of controversy, but we'll set that aside for now. The others nearby, however, paint a vastly different picture.\n\nNearby, a community college's satellite campus stands quietly by the road, its sleepy buildings a stark contrast to the hustle and bustle of the surrounding area. Students shuffle in for their morning classes, yawning and sipping their coffee as the iron gates creak open to let them in. Commuters driving by curse at the traffic congestion caused by the students. Down the road, a park and a rehabilitation center provide a stark contrast to the busy campus. The rehab center boasts a cheerful porch and a lazily turning ceiling fan, while children play tag in the park across the street, their laughter and shouts mingling with the buzzing bees in the nearby flower patches. Retirees stroll their dogs along the walking path, scowling at the teens on skateboards and nodding politely at the girls gossiping by the playground.\n\nIn a nearby strip mall, you can find a sushi restaurant with affordable food but rarely any crowd, a swimming supply store, and a nail salon nestled in between. It's possible to fill up your pool and get a manicure while enjoying hibachi chicken, all in one stop - the epitome of convenience. There's also a DIY frozen yogurt shop where teens often gather to do tricks on their skateboards and vape, sipping cold, dripping cups of frozen yogurt topped with their favorite treats. This little neighborhood is a slice of quintessential America, frozen in time and changeless, much like the sleepy south that surrounds it.",
            "As we cruised past the endless cornfields which stretched as far as my eyes could see, she asked, \"Where is everything?\" I knew she'd be taken aback by the bare expanses of open land. Coming from a town where the nearest grocery store was just a 5-minute walk away, she'd never experienced this much space before. I filled her in on what it was like growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood me and where I'm from. We drove along a two-lane country road, passing by a quarry filled with water before reaching my small development. The houses here are mostly brick and stucco, each with a lush half-acre of land that the residents take great pride in maintaining. Come spring, the annual flowers bloom alongside the midwestern trees that change with the seasons. The driveways are lined with sleek Mercedes-Benz luxury cars, glistening in the sunlight after a good wash. My home, a grey stucco house, came into view, and I pointed out my friendly Korean neighbor, who's always tending to his lawn and singing along to the hum of his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Everyone in the neighborhood loves him for his genuine and unique personality. He's aged and lost some of his wit, but his past as a doctor is still evident. As we continued down the road, I showed her the side yard, where geese roam free and are chased by our feisty Terrier. The backyard has a small stream that feeds into the quarry, where you can hear the soothing sounds of bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional \"moo\" from the nearby farms. Across a handmade wooden bridge lies an untouched oasis, teeming with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This is where I spent most of my childhood, building tree forts, playing \"hunt\" (which mostly involved chasing animals), and having neighborhood friends to share in the fun. Winters in my hometown can be harsh, but there's something beautiful about it. The yard transforms from a lush green to a barren wilderness, and the trees that once bloomed with vibrant flowers turn into skeletal branches. When snow falls, a winter wonderland appears overnight, and the backyard is filled with snow angels and snowmen made by my little sister and me. We fought frequently as kids, but during the winter, snowballs were our go-to weapon. We'd build massive forts to house our arsenal, using branches and our imaginations to create our own little wonderland – a place where we were carefree, just kids without a worry in the world.",
            "To truly grasp the essence of Portland, Oregon, one must first understand what being \"weird\" truly means. The unofficial town motto, proudly plastered on a building that defies categorization as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, and strip club, all while skirting the law, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, this phrase is a nostalgic reminder of the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's - a lesser-known, more affordable city that fostered unique and creative subcultures. For others, it's an invitation to come to Portland, where the term \"weird\" is now a badge of honor. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the relentless construction of high-rise condos to accommodate them, Portland remains stubbornly eccentric. Being weird doesn't mean being judgmental or exclusive, but rather accepting of things that wouldn't normally be accepted. We have our modern amenities and our share of modern issues, just like the rest of the country - we import most of our goods from China. There are countless ways to be weird, to be unconventional, but Portland has its fair share of the ordinary. You'll find yoga enthusiasts, hipsters, and suit-and-tie professionals living alongside one another. Perhaps \"weird\" simply means we don't take ourselves too seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, you'll find vibrant houses, home gardens bursting with flowers, herbs, and vegetables, and free boxes lining the streets during the summer months. Free boxes are essentially discarded items - often cardboard, sometimes plastic - containing treasures perfect for the passerby. They can hold anything from clothes and books to who-knows-what, and the thrill of the hunt is all part of the magic. This is what Portland is all about to me, but I'm just one of the many weird and wonderful souls that call this city home. Some people I live among would never dream of scavenging through a box on the sidewalk, opting instead for goat yoga or Timbers matches. Portland is a city of people with diverse passions and pursuits - we're a city of dreamers, both those who are actively chasing their dreams and those who spend too much time at the bar, lost in thought. Of course, like every city, Portland struggles with its fair share of problems, including a drug epidemic that often stems from underlying mental health issues. The constant rain and grey skies don't help, but neither do we. We also grapple with homelessness, a complex issue that seems to plague every major city in the country. Our social services are better than many other places, but they're still woefully insufficient. The non-homeless population is torn between empathy and frustration, and in this, we're not at all weird - just like any other city facing similar challenges.",
            "The mountains have been consistent witnesses to the passage of time, silently standing tall in the north as the sun rises and sets each day. They remain steadfast, unperturbed by life's turmoil, and unwavering in their presence. Even when I'm consumed by work and life's demands, they're there, always a constant in my life. On days when I'm feeling overwhelmed and drained, they beckon me to take a step back and rest my anxious soul, offering me the strength to carry on, day by day. It was during my undergrad days that I first fell in love with the mountains north of campus. While the university itself boasts its own unique charm, with its beautiful buildings, ponds, and trees, it's the mountains that hold a special place in my heart. Beyond the campus, the town itself has its own beauty. There are numerous cozy cafes where I spent countless hours fuelled by caffeine and cramming, and just a short walk away lies the downtown area, where the faded brick buildings exude an air of antiquity. This blend of old and new, bustling and serene, creates a captivating atmosphere that invites exploration. As a result, I've created many cherished memories in this town, each tied to a specific location. Whether it's strolling past the rusty swings in the park with friends after a long night of studying or racing through the downtown area to catch a movie in the university's cinema, this town has been a witness to many moments of joy and laughter. However, it's also a place of painful memories, as is true with any place in life. The ponds, in particular, have become a refuge for both reflection and late-night tears during moments of existential crisis. As I watch the turtles, ducks, and insects living their lives, each contributing to the ecosystem, I'm reminded of my own search for purpose. And so, I'd walk past the pond, the park, and the small houses that epitomize suburban life, until I reached the main street. It was then that I'd gaze up at the sunrise, and as the palm trees stood tall beneath it, I'd feel the warmth of the sun's rays. That's when I'd look north and see them: the sturdy, majestic mountains, their peaks grazing the hazy blue and yellow sky. In that moment, they'd stir something deep within me, a sense of resilience that has guided me through life's challenges.",
            "Bensonhurst is quite easy to find if you're planning on visiting. The public transportation system is very accessible, making it one of the most popular modes of transportation in New York City. As you walk through the neighborhood, you'll get a true taste of the city vibe. You'll see a plethora of Asian stores all around, which are a result of the influx of Asian inhabitants over the past two decades. It's not uncommon to spot an Asian-owned store on almost every block. Supermarkets and laundromats are particularly popular, not just among locals but also among visitors, thanks to their affordable prices, high-quality food, and convenient locations. In fact, I'm lucky enough to have four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk of each other, making grocery shopping a breeze. While Bensonhurst is predominantly Asian, it's not homogeneous – you'll find a mix of immigrants, first-generation and second-generation American kids, and a diverse community. The majority of big businesses in the area are Asian-owned, but you'll also find a beautifully renovated park nearby, complete with ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, a playground, and a water fountain for kids to enjoy during the summer. The park is a melting pot of diversity, where people from different backgrounds can come together and get along. When it comes to living spaces, you won't find many high-rise corporate buildings. Instead, you'll see co-op living buildings and condominium apartments, with two-family houses being the most common type of residence. While the people here are generally nice, they can be quite loud. You'll often hear cars blasting music as they drive by, or people flooring it on the gas, which can make for an early morning wake-up call. If you're planning a night visit, be cautious; while the neighborhood is generally safe, you never know who you might run into. Be prepared to encounter people who might start trouble for no reason, bullies, and even thieves. I've had my own share of run-ins with bullies in the past, but thankfully, it was a long time ago. More recently, there have been cases of package theft in the area. Lastly, be aware that people in this neighborhood don't always follow the rules, like cleaning up after their dogs. You'll often see dog waste on the sidewalk, which can be quite frustrating. Just be careful where you step and make sure to keep your shoes clean!",
            "Where I live, the sidewalks are scarce. It's like everything flows downhill, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest slope in the neighbourhood. They call it the \"workout hill\" because many joggers like to run up it as part of their daily routine. Since there are no sidewalks on my street, people walk on the road. The road itself is pitted in some places and can be a bit hazardous to drive on due to several potholes. The telephone and electric wires strung around the block look tattered, and with the frequent rain and storms, branches and debris often knock them down, requiring constant repairs. As a result, they appear patchwork-y and worn out. The area is filled with tall evergreen trees, but the residents dislike them, viewing them as obstructing the ocean view. To compensate, many houses are built high up on the hill, with large glass-fronted second-storey sections that offer a stunning view of the bay. When the sun sets, the water seems to be lit up from below, and the sky turns a vibrant orange. However, it's cloudy most days, so the sunlight often gets filtered through the haze. The weather is mostly overcast and damp, with moss growing on everything it can, from roofs to cars to railings. I once left my car in the driveway for a month, and when I returned, it had turned green and furry with moss, taking three hours to clean off. My neighbourhood is mostly home to older residents, many of whom are retired. In contrast to children, dogs are a common sight in our area, often seen lounging in people's yards or racing down the street. If you leave a door or window open, they might sneak into your house. I once found one in my living room and had to shoo it out the front door. Rabbits are also rampant in the area, digging up roots and burrowing into lawns, much to the dismay of the gardeners. My cats, however, love them and have managed to hunt most of them out of our neighbourhood. The area is also home to a variety of birds, including small sparrows and hummingbirds, as well as the occasional hawk or eagle that soars by until chased off by the neighbourhood crows. If you're willing to hike downhill to the waterfront, you can find a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. The shoreline itself is narrow, but the rocks along the shore make for fun places to throw stones into the water. The bay is not wide, and on most days, you can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist.",
            "We live in a small neighborhood in a southern Tennessee town, situated on a street that connects two state highways. The traffic can get pretty busy, but overall, it's a quiet and peaceful area. I've gotten used to the familiar faces of my neighbors, who keep busy with yard work and daily chores. In the winter, my family and I sled down the hill on our side street, enjoying the thrill of the ride. Our house is at the front corner of the street, so we see everyone passing by and have a good idea of who lives around here. Whenever a new car appears, we take notice. Some neighbors walk their dogs or exercise, while the kids ride their bikes. We spend a lot of time at home, working from there, and our family of four - my wife, our two daughters (11 and 14 years old) - is pretty used to seeing us come and go. We love spending time outside, even on rainy days, and occasionally we fire up the grill on our back deck, filling the air with the delicious smell of barbecue. The sound of lawn mowers fills the air from March to October, reminding us that the grass is growing. Our neighborhood was once wooded, so we have plenty of shade and beautiful trees, but also a lot of leaves in the fall, which means regular raking and burning. We enjoy the smell of burning leaves, signaling the arrival of fall. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we mainly use the back door, unless someone knocks on the front door, which is a rare occurrence. When I work on my truck or other projects in the garage, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. On holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas, the neighborhood is quiet, except for the occasional visitors and extra cars parked around. It's a great place to live, and if it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "Yesterday, I reflected on my neighborhood in the high desert. It's like being smack in the middle of a vast expanse of dirt, with not a speck of green in sight. People who haven't experienced living here might not grasp the feeling of seeing nothing but brown every time they step out. When I first arrived in the 90s, the houses were scattered far apart. Now, it's the same, with new additions sprouting up everywhere. Our neighborhood is transforming into a city, but it's happening everywhere, not just here. Most people are friendly, but like any urban area, there are good and bad parts. I'm surrounded by friendly seniors, so I feel pretty lucky to live here. The local stores are mostly chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want to find something unique, you have to head elsewhere. Construction is the most prominent industry in our area, and I think it's because this city is still relatively undeveloped, leaving plenty of open space to build. To be honest, it worries me - I prefer things the way they are now. I left the city to escape the chaos and don't want to go back. Speaking of construction, my job as a drywall and T-bar installer is right in this field. What I love about my home is the wildlife. People come to the high desert for its breathtaking beauty, but it also has a unique ecosystem that needs protection. We have a responsibility to learn about the animals that call this place home so we can coexist peacefully. I've got three kids, and they're just like me - they're fascinated by lizards and desert bugs. Right now, they're outside trying to catch different species. As for attractions, we've got a few things to offer. Victorville is a great place for families to experience the desert. If you plan your visit during the San Bernardino County Fair, you'll get a memorable experience. Head to Wrightwood to see the snow-capped mountains and take some winter sports lessons to cap off your trip. If you're interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert, the Victor Valley Museum has an impressive collection of geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of how our community developed and thrived.",
            "To describe my neighborhood, I'd say my answer is pretty one-of-a-kind. While others might think of their neighborhood as a typical residential area, mine's a bit different. For me, my neighborhood is actually the college campus I stay on, and the people in my dorm are like my community. I also consider the surrounding campus as part of my neighborhood, but to a lesser extent. Despite being a bit unconventional, my neighborhood shares some familiar traits with the usual idea of a neighborhood. Like any ordinary neighborhood, it's got houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's start with the 'houses' that make up my neighborhood. Before diving into the specifics, I should clarify the different types of housing in my vicinity. There are three main types: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory houses. First, in the apartments, each room usually has 2-4 people, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor, making each building home to around 20 people. Then, there are the actual houses that are available for rent for those affiliated with the school - usually 2-4 bedroom setups, often occupied by alumni, but there aren't many of these around. Lastly, there are the dorm rooms, which house hundreds of students, typically with two people sharing a room, except in some cases. These are the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered, let's move on to the people. My school's all about diversity, and that's reflected in the mix of cultures and ages living in my neighborhood. The professional staff live in the houses, while newer students stay in dorms and older students stay in apartments. It's hard to do justice to the people in my neighborhood, so let's skip to the stores and parks. Since my school is essentially its own self-contained neighborhood, it has plenty of stores and a single park. The stores offer a mix of dining options and the school's own brand of clothing and grocery stores, so you can find everything you need within the neighborhood. The park's a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, kept clean and safe thanks to everyone's efforts.",
            "I must say that after being here for about a decade, I've got some stories to share. I still remember the day I moved here to this neighborhood, I was really down, coming from Riverdale to Stockbridge. It was tough, I won't deny it, I missed them and the life we had there, but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sis, so we packed up and moved to a new place with better housing and a better high school. It was a big change, but over the years, I got used to it and made some new friends and, unfortunately, some new enemies at school too. One thing that's stuck with me is that I never really took the time to get to know my neighbors, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis, who we were lucky to have living next door. They've been like family to me, and I'm really grateful to have them. I remember when my family and I went to Mr. Glen's wedding; it was an amazing experience, and I'm hoping to have something similar one day when I'm older and settled. When Ms. Veda took off her wedding anklet and threw it, I was quick enough to catch it, but I wish I'd caught the flowers too! We danced the night away, and I had a blast with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I've lost touch with her since, but I hope she's doing great. The neighborhood can be confusing, but now that I have a GPS, it's easier to explore. I've only gone so far, mostly hanging out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We used to spend hours playing video games and living life to the fullest. I'd also head to the park to enjoy nature, which really calms me down and gives me a sense of peace. I'd bring sticks and practice my balance, and sometimes I'd bring my bokken sword if I could. It's great to do what I love. We also have a basketball and tennis court, even though I haven't played either sport in a while, it's good to have them around just in case I decide to pick them up again. My dad got me and my best friend into tennis with Mr. Graves, and we always had a blast, even though they pushed us hard. I'm sure there are plenty of more stories from my time here, but these are the things that really stand out, and who knows, the best is yet to come.",
            "The college that I attend is actually just nearby my place, which I must say I'm pretty fortunate about. I live in an apartment building, but there are a few restaurants and bars around that are pretty cool to hang out at, and they're not too pricey. I recently heard that one of the bars has been renamed, and it's a bit more expensive than the others, but the service and drinks aren't too bad. The people in the area are pretty nice, and since it's a college town, there are mostly students and low-income individuals living in the apartment buildings. You can also tell that there are a lot of families around, probably because there's an elementary school within walking distance from my apartment. I don't really know my neighbors, and to be honest, I don't particularly want to. They smoke a lot of weed, and our apartment management decided to put an air freshener unit right outside their door, which my boyfriend and I found pretty amusing. It's almost as if they're mocking us. The apartment buildings around me are mostly old-looking on the outside, but they might have been renovated inside. A bit further down the street, there are brand new apartments, but I don't really like them. I think the construction quality isn't that great, and the rent is super high, which I think is a bit unfair. Since they're close to the campus, the management of those buildings can get away with charging us exorbitant rent. There's this really cheap restaurant just a few minutes from my place that serves food on paper plates and most of it is microwaved. Across from that place is a gas station, which I've heard isn't a great place to work. However, thanks to some funding from the city, the road was renovated last summer, so now there's a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and the area looks a bit better. But my apartment building is actually pretty shaded, with lots of trees around it. They cut down a few of them, so there are a few stumps left behind, but there are still a lot of trees around my place compared to the other street. Behind my apartment complex is a row of trees, and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind it is 43rd street, and that one's not as nice. The sidewalks on that street are pretty bad and are falling apart, and most of the buildings look pretty run-down. There are a lot of trees on that street, but it's probably just to hide the state of the buildings. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but I don't think it's fair to blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But overall, I like living here. The rent is affordable, and there are plenty of useful amenities nearby, including the university, which is within walking distance, and there are two bus stops so I can easily get to the store and downtown.",
            "My current neighborhood is comprised of rows of duplex's in a cul-de-sac. They appear to be individual houses due to the intermittent placement and spacing, although they are painted the same, with yellow walls, white porches, and green metal roofs. Most of the residents are on friendly terms with one another, which adds to the communal atmosphere. Every evening, some of us stand at the end of our driveways and engage in casual conversations while the kids in the neighborhood play with their toys, create art with sidewalk chalk, or fly their kites. This setting is a refreshing escape from the monotony of the modern world, which is dominated by technology and computers. It's as if we're living in a bygone era. The surroundings are picturesque, with fields and trees accompanied by blue skies and puffy white clouds. However, this season has brought us tornado warnings, and for the first time, we actually heard the tornado sirens last night, prompting us to seek shelter. I, along with my little dog, found myself in the bathtub, clutching my purse and a few pillows. My larger dog, however, remained in the living room, whining and barking nervously due to the unusual circumstances. The neighborhood was eerily quiet, except for the sound of large hail pounding against the ground. After the storm passed, the road was steaming due to the dramatic temperature change, with the hail melting as soon as it hit the hot pavement. As I gazed up at the clearing skies, the sun broke through, and it began to rain. A double rainbow appeared, and I quickly ran inside to grab my camera to capture the moment. I shared the photos with my friends and family on Facebook, and they were just as amazed as I was. The streets remained quiet for another hour before people started returning home, and then it was back to normal – moms and kids outside, dinner being cooked. I've grown to adore this friendly neighborhood, especially the southern accent that's become music to my ears. Although all the houses appear identical on the outside, each apartment has its own unique layout and charm. Some are surprisingly small, which I find hard to understand. I enjoy taking leisurely walks through the largest field behind my home and strolling down to the pond, which isn't suitable for swimming. I've spotted deer, and in the mornings, you can hear the deep, resonant song of the bullfrog. It's a fantastic place to live, just a forty-minute drive away from the city of Charlotte. Each morning is a beautiful start, accompanied by the sounds of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It's as if we're living in a small, self-contained community. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that lets out a distinctive bray in the evenings, serving as a gentle reminder of his presence. I feel fortunate to have found this hidden gem of a neighborhood.",
            "It was my first day of eighth grade when I moved into this neighborhood. Making friends wasn't easy at first, but luckily I connected with two of my neighbors - one living two houses down and another on my street. Unfortunately, they've since moved away, but the memories still linger. To my surprise, most of the original residents who welcomed me when I first arrived are still here. Our neighborhood is pretty much your typical American suburban setup - rows of two-story houses and the usual sounds of kids playing outside on warm days. Weekends are usually pretty quiet, but when it's warm, you can hear the laughter of kids outside. I've been fortunate to have never had any issues with my neighbors, and it's clear that this is a community where you're left alone unless you genuinely need help. Online deliveries have become a norm, and I've ordered multiple times without ever having a package go missing from my porch. This speaks volumes about the trust my neighbors have in each other. A park just a minute or two away has been a hub for some of my fondest memories, including playing basketball, football, and baseball with my neighborhood friends. However, it's also where I suffered a painful injury when I got elbowed in the nose during a football game. The good memories far outweigh the bad, though. Nowadays, I visit the park to spend quality time with my cousin's younger kids, who still love playing on the swings and slides. Watching them brings back a mix of emotions, making me nostalgic for my past experiences there. The neighborhood is a melting pot of cultures, with an array of cuisines nearby. Just within a one-mile radius, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants, as well as plenty of fast-food shops and pizza places. Online food delivery services like GrubHub and DoorDash have become increasingly popular, though. The local stores cater to all our needs, with multiple dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store on the same street. There's even an Indian-owned store for those who crave homemade or ready-made Indian food. After seeing the unfortunate stories of neighborly conflicts on social media and news, I feel grateful to live in a neighborhood where I can trust my neighbors.",
            "My hometown is a charming little town in South Carolina that doesn't stand out from the rest, but it's a significant contributor to the agriculture sector. Johnston claims to be the Peach Capital of the World, a title proudly displayed on the town's welcoming sign. Its main landscape consists of farmland where peach trees and cattle dominate the scene. Houses, mostly two-story affairs with metal or gray roofs to combat the scorching summer heat, are scattered throughout the outskirts of town. They're often set back from the road, allowing the front fields to be used for grazing animals and crops. The central part of town features a single stoplight at an intersection, where the few shops are located. A small Chinese restaurant called Hong Kong, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a local burger chain, offer limited dining options. A former pizzeria has since closed down. There's a small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug, famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola. A tiny grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, is the town's sole grocery store, but many residents prefer to shop at the nearby Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville. However, the most bustling spot in town is Dollar General, which sells a vast array of everyday items and is always crowded from opening to closing. A small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind-hearted woman, has been a staple in Johnston for years and even employs delivery services. Adjacent to the furniture store is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet groomer offering various services. Both a doctor's office and a veterinary clinic are located outside the main town area, providing essential services to the residents. The town has a single elementary school, Johnston Elementary School, but students attend middle and high school in the next town over after completing the fifth grade. Although there aren't many recreational activities, the town is working on creating a 2.5-acre recreational area to attract visitors and potential residents. While it's a quiet town with limited amenities, it's still a pleasant place to live, so small that you could easily miss it in the blink of an eye.",
            "The first time I heard about my neighborhood, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It caught me off guard. Almost every apartment in the area was renting for over a thousand dollars a month, but I'd never heard anything about this story. Neither had my friends. It's like the darkness that settles in when you're struggling. I know some of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night due to financial struggles. We've learned to be thrifty over the years, but it's funny how you start to appreciate the smell of second-hand items and old clothes. You even start to enjoy the smell of stale air. As an adult, you might start smoking or just get used to the way things are. But the thrift stores in my area never fail to remind me of this reality. There are three within walking distance, and if you start from the far end, you'll find charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. The townscape may be chaotic, with cars and people packed into the streets every morning, but the thrift stores are always quiet. It's the perfect place to lose an afternoon. Every year, the city grows more crowded with cars and people. It's a developing city, they say, and it's home to one of the largest e-commerce empires. It reminds me of New York, where everyone's focused on their goals and nobody bothers you. You can keep to yourself, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where people seem to pry into your life. In this city, you can keep your shell intact, and the city will just roll on like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be, with the pianist next door and the amateur vocalists upstairs always creating something new. We don't live in a typical apartment of strangers; instead, we're a community of friends who come together for birthdays, funerals, and when we need help. I'm lucky to be here, and I really like most of my neighbors. We look out for each other, clean up after ourselves, and share food and mail. It's nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. Despite living in a massive modernist sprawl, my neighbors make me feel like I haven't completely messed up my life.",
            "I live in a typical suburban area, nothing out of the ordinary. My neighborhood is like a cookie cutter version of suburban living. Everywhere you look, you'll see well-maintained single family homes, thanks to our homeowner's association. The front yards all share a similar theme: a small patch of neatly cut grass, some decorative pebbles, and short driveways. You'll also spot small trees scattered here and there. Every house has two-car garages. As you drive through the neighborhood, you'll notice newly paved concrete roads in excellent condition – no potholes or bumps in sight. Most of the homes are one-story, but some have two stories as well. What sets our neighborhood apart is the mail system. Instead of individual mailboxes in front of each house, we have a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street that require a key to access. We also have two big package lockers, courtesy of our HOA's love for uniformity. Our neighborhood is on the outskirts of the nearby city, so it's a mix of rural and suburban living. We have plenty of open land and a range of amenities, including multiple community pools that are well-maintained and gated. There are also walking trails where you can take your dog for a walk or go for a solo evening stroll. Exercise isn't a problem here – you can simply run around the neighborhood and get your daily dose of exercise. Our community is predominantly made up of retirees, but we also have a mix of middle-aged and young professionals. The city itself is surprisingly large, with a small-town feel. We have all the amenities you'd expect, including a single mall that may not be huge, but gets the job done. It takes me about 15 minutes to drive to anywhere significant, but once I get there, I have access to a variety of stores, from high-end grocery stores to bargain outlets. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty standard – we have our nice touches like pools and walking trails, and while we're not right next door to any shopping centers, it's an easy drive to get to any major chain store I want.",
            "I reside in a small Midwestern town situated just outside the suburban outskirts of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, located on the east side, is considered the most economically disadvantaged area within the town. Property values are on the lower side, with most houses rented or owned by low-income individuals, yet it's far from unattractive or unpleasant. The people in my neighborhood are generally friendly and always greet me with a smile when I walk down the street. Crime rates are slightly higher than in other parts of town, but still relatively low. In the past decade, a few violent crimes have occurred close to my home, including shootings and a homicide. Our next-door neighbors recently lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar. Fortunately, my family hasn't been directly affected by crime, except for occasionally losing items from our porch when we forget to bring them inside. Our town has been greatly impacted by the \"opioid epidemic\" affecting many parts of the United States. Unfortunately, many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are numerous resources available to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those struggling with addiction. Despite the challenges, my town has many positive qualities. My son's elementary school has an excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. He has special needs, yet he hasn't faced any bullying due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he truly loves attending. We have an active PTO that organizes multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Given that over 20% of our town's population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child ever goes hungry. No child or family is treated as less than due to financial constraints, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are reasonable. The City Council and staff have implemented various improvements to our town's appearance, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the town center and on the west side, where shopping areas are located and most traffic passes through. In contrast, the east side, where I live, tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for my neighbors and me. Despite these issues, I genuinely enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are excellent, there are sufficient shopping options to meet my family's needs, and while our home may not be worth much, it is comfortable and suitable. We've lived here for over 16 years, and it's hard to imagine calling anywhere else home.",
            "My neighborhood is a vibrant cultural hub, nestled on a hill surrounded by buildings steeped in history. I live in a 7-story apartment building right opposite the old theater, and just down the road, you'll find a trendy arcade bar that draws in a diverse crowd on warm summer evenings. The line of people waiting to get in is a common sight, especially during weekends in June and July. A short walk up is the city park, a decent size considering its location. The park is encircled by concrete, with steep stairs carved into the wall. During the harsh winter months, you'll see homeless people setting up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and wide steps. Although it doesn't snow often, the heavy rainfall in mid-winter can be challenging to cope with. By setting their tents close together in the city center, they stay relatively warmer. They're also close to the local family center, where they can access basic necessities like showers and baths. What I love about my city isn't its historic architecture or the hills that roll down to the ocean. It's the people themselves who make my neighborhood so special. You see, Hilltop was once notorious for gang violence on the West Coast, and stories of federal officials and the DEA sweeping through the area still circulate today. The community still remembers those days. Despite being considered one of the rougher neighborhoods in the city, the people work hard to keep it clean and safe. They still care about what happens in their area, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill at night, but I think this warning is a relic of the past, tainted with social conditioning. Perhaps it's because I blend in as a 'not-so-white' person, or maybe the Hilltop community recognizes me as one of their own, someone who's just as aware of the reminders that plague our nation. These reminders are a result of racism, cultural conditioning, and ignorance-fueled assumptions, even in a city that prides itself as a cultural melting pot. I know one thing: no matter where life takes me, Hilltop will always be home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who've shown me kindness and compassion, even when I needed it most. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open late to charge my phone when I was stranded in the rain. It's a place where I've sat, feeling invisible, huddled against a concrete storefront on a bleak night, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I reside in Rural America, a small town in Michigan. The landscape here is a beautiful mix of farmland and quaint tourist cities. We don't have the big city luxuries like malls, chain stores like Wal-mart or Target, or even a fancy restaurant like Applebee's. Everything you need is within driving distance. Despite this, our little town is surrounded by breathtaking natural beauty - the stunning waters of Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Every corner of our \"city\" offers access to a beach where you can dip your toes in the water. Our neighborhood perfectly embodies the essence of small-town life. Houses are spread out, not towering on top of each other like in big cities. They're a mix of old and new, with some homes dating back years and others beautifully renovated. Most houses have full basements that are visible from the road, giving them a charming, down-to-earth feel. The neighborhood is a kaleidoscope of colors, with houses painted in every hue imaginable. Yards are a common feature, with trampolines, playsets, and even gardens and fences for pets. The atmosphere is quintessentially Middle American - hardworking folks striving to make a living, some raising families and others having already done so. On any given day, you'll see kids running up and down the streets, people walking their dogs, biking, or rollerblading. Neighbors know and look out for one another, and you can quickly tell who's part of the community and who's an outsider. You'll see people grilling in their front yards, waving at passersby, or walking their dogs and exchanging pleasantries with neighbors a few blocks away. Lawns are well-maintained, with neatly trimmed grass and tidy gardens. It's not a neighborhood that will leave you awestruck, but one that exudes a sense of comfort and security. It's a quiet, peaceful place where you can feel safe, and that's exactly what people want in life. Within walking distance, you'll find the county sheriff's department, the health department, and the recycling center, which serves the entire city. We have baseball and softball fields nearby, where you can hear the announcers calling out the names of players and keeping score. The small town airport is just a stone's throw away, and you can often hear the sound of small planes taking off and landing. You can also walk to the local ice cream shop or head downtown from our neighborhood. My kids can ride their bikes to the nearby park, which is just an 8-block ride away. It's a wonderful place to call home."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way.

            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

Yet, my neighborhood and many others still stand as a testament to that dream, holding onto it as tightly as we can.

            "As we cruised past the endless cornfields which stretched as far as my eyes could see, she asked, \"Where is everything?\" I knew she'd be taken aback by the bare expanses of open land. Coming from a town where the nearest grocery store was just a 5-minute walk away, she'd never experienced this much space before. I filled her in on what it was like growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood me and where I'm from.

Everyone in the neighborhood loves him for his genuine and unique personality. He's aged and lost some of his wit, but his past as a doctor is still evident.

When snow falls, a winter wonderland appears overnight, and the backyard is filled with snow angels and snowmen made by my little sister and me.

The unofficial town motto, proudly plastered on a building that defies categorization as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, and strip club, all while skirting the law, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, this phrase is a nostalgic reminder of the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's - a lesser-known, more affordable city that fostered unique and creative subcultures.

Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the relentless construction of high-rise condos to accommodate them, Portland remains stubbornly eccentric. Being weird doesn't mean being judgmental or exclusive, but rather accepting of things that wouldn't normally be accepted. We have our modern amenities and our share of modern issues, just like the rest of the country - we import most of our goods from China. There are countless ways to be weird, to be unconventional, but Portland has its fair share of the ordinary. You'll find yoga enthusiasts, hipsters, and suit-and-tie professionals living alongside one another. Perhaps \"weird\" simply means we don't take ourselves too seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, you'll find vibrant houses, home gardens bursting with flowers, herbs, and vegetables, and free boxes lining the streets during the summer months. Free boxes are essentially discarded items - often cardboard, sometimes plastic - containing treasures perfect for the passerby. They can hold anything from clothes and books to who-knows-what, and the thrill of the hunt is all part of the magic. This is what Portland is all about to me, but I'm just one of the many weird and wonderful souls that call this city home. Some people I live among would never dream of scavenging through a box on the sidewalk, opting instead for goat yoga or Timbers matches. Portland is a city of people with diverse passions and pursuits - we're a city of dreamers, both those who are actively chasing their dreams and those who spend too much time at the bar, lost in thought. Of course, like every city, Portland struggles with its fair share of problems, including a drug epidemic that often stems from underlying mental health issues. The constant rain and grey skies don't help, but neither do we. We also grapple with homelessness, a complex issue that seems to plague every major city in the country. Our social services are better than many other places, but they're still woefully insufficient. The non-homeless population is torn between empathy and frustration, and in this, we're not at all weird - just like any other city facing similar challenges.",
            "The mountains have been consistent witnesses to the passage of time, silently standing tall in the north as the sun rises and sets each day. They remain steadfast, unperturbed by life's turmoil, and unwavering in their presence. Even when I'm consumed by work and life's demands, they're there, always a constant in my life. On days when I'm feeling overwhelmed and drained, they beckon me to take a step back and rest my anxious soul, offering me the strength to carry on, day by day. It was during my undergrad days that I first fell in love with the mountains north of campus. While the university itself boasts its own unique charm, with its beautiful buildings, ponds, and trees, it's the mountains that hold a special place in my heart. Beyond the campus, the town itself has its own beauty. There are numerous cozy cafes where I spent countless hours fuelled by caffeine and cramming, and just a short walk away lies the downtown area, where the faded brick buildings exude an air of antiquity. This blend of old and new, bustling and serene, creates a captivating atmosphere that invites exploration. As a result, I've created many cherished memories in this town, each tied to a specific location. Whether it's strolling past the rusty swings in the park with friends after a long night of studying or racing through the downtown area to catch a movie in the university's cinema, this town has been a witness to many moments of joy and laughter. However, it's also a place of painful memories, as is true with any place in life. The ponds, in particular, have become a refuge for both reflection and late-night tears during moments of existential crisis. As I watch the turtles, ducks, and insects living their lives, each contributing to the ecosystem, I'm reminded of my own search for purpose. And so, I'd walk past the pond, the park, and the small houses that epitomize suburban life, until I reached the main street. It was then that I'd gaze up at the sunrise, and as the palm trees stood tall beneath it, I'd feel the warmth of the sun's rays. That's when I'd look north and see them: the sturdy, majestic mountains, their peaks grazing the hazy blue and yellow sky. In that moment, they'd stir something deep within me, a sense of resilience that has guided me through life's challenges.",
            "Bensonhurst is quite easy to find if you're planning on visiting. The public transportation system is very accessible, making it one of the most popular modes of transportation in New York City. As you walk through the neighborhood, you'll get a true taste of the city vibe. You'll see a plethora of Asian stores all around, which are a result of the influx of Asian inhabitants over the past two decades. It's not uncommon to spot an Asian-owned store on almost every block. Supermarkets and laundromats are particularly popular, not just among locals but also among visitors, thanks to their affordable prices, high-quality food, and convenient locations. In fact, I'm lucky enough to have four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk of each other, making grocery shopping a breeze. While Bensonhurst is predominantly Asian, it's not homogeneous – you'll find a mix of immigrants, first-generation and second-generation American kids, and a diverse community. The majority of big businesses in the area are Asian-owned, but you'll also find a beautifully renovated park nearby, complete with ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, a playground, and a water fountain for kids to enjoy during the summer. The park is a melting pot of diversity, where people from different backgrounds can come together and get along. When it comes to living spaces, you won't find many high-rise corporate buildings. Instead, you'll see co-op living buildings and condominium apartments, with two-family houses being the most common type of residence. While the people here are generally nice, they can be quite loud. You'll often hear cars blasting music as they drive by, or people flooring it on the gas, which can make for an early morning wake-up call. If you're planning a night visit, be cautious; while the neighborhood is generally safe, you never know who you might run into. Be prepared to encounter people who might start trouble for no reason, bullies, and even thieves. I've had my own share of run-ins with bullies in the past, but thankfully, it was a long time ago. More recently, there have been cases of package theft in the area. Lastly, be aware that people in this neighborhood don't always follow the rules, like cleaning up after their dogs. You'll often see dog waste on the sidewalk, which can be quite frustrating. Just be careful where you step and make sure to keep your shoes clean!",
            "Where I live, the sidewalks are scarce. It's like everything flows downhill, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest slope in the neighbourhood. They call it the \"workout hill\" because many joggers like to run up it as part of their daily routine. Since there are no sidewalks on my street, people walk on the road. The road itself is pitted in some places and can be a bit hazardous to drive on due to several potholes. The telephone and electric wires strung around the block look tattered, and with the frequent rain and storms, branches and debris often knock them down, requiring constant repairs. As a result, they appear patchwork-y and worn out. The area is filled with tall evergreen trees, but the residents dislike them, viewing them as obstructing the ocean view. To compensate, many houses are built high up on the hill, with large glass-fronted second-storey sections that offer a stunning view of the bay. When the sun sets, the water seems to be lit up from below, and the sky turns a vibrant orange. However, it's cloudy most days, so the sunlight often gets filtered through the haze. The weather is mostly overcast and damp, with moss growing on everything it can, from roofs to cars to railings. I once left my car in the driveway for a month, and when I returned, it had turned green and furry with moss, taking three hours to clean off. My neighbourhood is mostly home to older residents, many of whom are retired. In contrast to children, dogs are a common sight in our area, often seen lounging in people's yards or racing down the street. If you leave a door or window open, they might sneak into your house. I once found one in my living room and had to shoo it out the front door. Rabbits are also rampant in the area, digging up roots and burrowing into lawns, much to the dismay of the gardeners. My cats, however, love them and have managed to hunt most of them out of our neighbourhood. The area is also home to a variety of birds, including small sparrows and hummingbirds, as well as the occasional hawk or eagle that soars by until chased off by the neighbourhood crows. If you're willing to hike downhill to the waterfront, you can find a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. The shoreline itself is narrow, but the rocks along the shore make for fun places to throw stones into the water. The bay is not wide, and on most days, you can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist.",
            "We live in a small neighborhood in a southern Tennessee town, situated on a street that connects two state highways. The traffic can get pretty busy, but overall, it's a quiet and peaceful area. I've gotten used to the familiar faces of my neighbors, who keep busy with yard work and daily chores. In the winter, my family and I sled down the hill on our side street, enjoying the thrill of the ride. Our house is at the front corner of the street, so we see everyone passing by and have a good idea of who lives around here. Whenever a new car appears, we take notice. Some neighbors walk their dogs or exercise, while the kids ride their bikes. We spend a lot of time at home, working from there, and our family of four - my wife, our two daughters (11 and 14 years old) - is pretty used to seeing us come and go. We love spending time outside, even on rainy days, and occasionally we fire up the grill on our back deck, filling the air with the delicious smell of barbecue. The sound of lawn mowers fills the air from March to October, reminding us that the grass is growing. Our neighborhood was once wooded, so we have plenty of shade and beautiful trees, but also a lot of leaves in the fall, which means regular raking and burning. We enjoy the smell of burning leaves, signaling the arrival of fall. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we mainly use the back door, unless someone knocks on the front door, which is a rare occurrence. When I work on my truck or other projects in the garage, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. On holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas, the neighborhood is quiet, except for the occasional visitors and extra cars parked around. It's a great place to live, and if it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "Yesterday, I reflected on my neighborhood in the high desert. It's like being smack in the middle of a vast expanse of dirt, with not a speck of green in sight. People who haven't experienced living here might not grasp the feeling of seeing nothing but brown every time they step out. When I first arrived in the 90s, the houses were scattered far apart. Now, it's the same, with new additions sprouting up everywhere. Our neighborhood is transforming into a city, but it's happening everywhere, not just here. Most people are friendly, but like any urban area, there are good and bad parts. I'm surrounded by friendly seniors, so I feel pretty lucky to live here. The local stores are mostly chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want to find something unique, you have to head elsewhere. Construction is the most prominent industry in our area, and I think it's because this city is still relatively undeveloped, leaving plenty of open space to build. To be honest, it worries me - I prefer things the way they are now. I left the city to escape the chaos and don't want to go back. Speaking of construction, my job as a drywall and T-bar installer is right in this field. What I love about my home is the wildlife. People come to the high desert for its breathtaking beauty, but it also has a unique ecosystem that needs protection. We have a responsibility to learn about the animals that call this place home so we can coexist peacefully. I've got three kids, and they're just like me - they're fascinated by lizards and desert bugs. Right now, they're outside trying to catch different species. As for attractions, we've got a few things to offer. Victorville is a great place for families to experience the desert. If you plan your visit during the San Bernardino County Fair, you'll get a memorable experience. Head to Wrightwood to see the snow-capped mountains and take some winter sports lessons to cap off your trip. If you're interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert, the Victor Valley Museum has an impressive collection of geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of how our community developed and thrived.",
            "To describe my neighborhood, I'd say my answer is pretty one-of-a-kind. While others might think of their neighborhood as a typical residential area, mine's a bit different. For me, my neighborhood is actually the college campus I stay on, and the people in my dorm are like my community. I also consider the surrounding campus as part of my neighborhood, but to a lesser extent. Despite being a bit unconventional, my neighborhood shares some familiar traits with the usual idea of a neighborhood. Like any ordinary neighborhood, it's got houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's start with the 'houses' that make up my neighborhood. Before diving into the specifics, I should clarify the different types of housing in my vicinity. There are three main types: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory houses. First, in the apartments, each room usually has 2-4 people, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor, making each building home to around 20 people. Then, there are the actual houses that are available for rent for those affiliated with the school - usually 2-4 bedroom setups, often occupied by alumni, but there aren't many of these around. Lastly, there are the dorm rooms, which house hundreds of students, typically with two people sharing a room, except in some cases. These are the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered, let's move on to the people. My school's all about diversity, and that's reflected in the mix of cultures and ages living in my neighborhood. The professional staff live in the houses, while newer students stay in dorms and older students stay in apartments. It's hard to do justice to the people in my neighborhood, so let's skip to the stores and parks. Since my school is essentially its own self-contained neighborhood, it has plenty of stores and a single park. The stores offer a mix of dining options and the school's own brand of clothing and grocery stores, so you can find everything you need within the neighborhood. The park's a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, kept clean and safe thanks to everyone's efforts.",
            "I must say that after being here for about a decade, I've got some stories to share. I still remember the day I moved here to this neighborhood, I was really down, coming from Riverdale to Stockbridge. It was tough, I won't deny it, I missed them and the life we had there, but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sis, so we packed up and moved to a new place with better housing and a better high school. It was a big change, but over the years, I got used to it and made some new friends and, unfortunately, some new enemies at school too. One thing that's stuck with me is that I never really took the time to get to know my neighbors, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis, who we were lucky to have living next door. They've been like family to me, and I'm really grateful to have them. I remember when my family and I went to Mr. Glen's wedding; it was an amazing experience, and I'm hoping to have something similar one day when I'm older and settled. When Ms. Veda took off her wedding anklet and threw it, I was quick enough to catch it, but I wish I'd caught the flowers too! We danced the night away, and I had a blast with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I've lost touch with her since, but I hope she's doing great. The neighborhood can be confusing, but now that I have a GPS, it's easier to explore. I've only gone so far, mostly hanging out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We used to spend hours playing video games and living life to the fullest. I'd also head to the park to enjoy nature, which really calms me down and gives me a sense of peace. I'd bring sticks and practice my balance, and sometimes I'd bring my bokken sword if I could. It's great to do what I love. We also have a basketball and tennis court, even though I haven't played either sport in a while, it's good to have them around just in case I decide to pick them up again. My dad got me and my best friend into tennis with Mr. Graves, and we always had a blast, even though they pushed us hard. I'm sure there are plenty of more stories from my time here, but these are the things that really stand out, and who knows, the best is yet to come.",
            "The college that I attend is actually just nearby my place, which I must say I'm pretty fortunate about. I live in an apartment building, but there are a few restaurants and bars around that are pretty cool to hang out at, and they're not too pricey. I recently heard that one of the bars has been renamed, and it's a bit more expensive than the others, but the service and drinks aren't too bad. The people in the area are pretty nice, and since it's a college town, there are mostly students and low-income individuals living in the apartment buildings. You can also tell that there are a lot of families around, probably because there's an elementary school within walking distance from my apartment. I don't really know my neighbors, and to be honest, I don't particularly want to. They smoke a lot of weed, and our apartment management decided to put an air freshener unit right outside their door, which my boyfriend and I found pretty amusing. It's almost as if they're mocking us. The apartment buildings around me are mostly old-looking on the outside, but they might have been renovated inside. A bit further down the street, there are brand new apartments, but I don't really like them. I think the construction quality isn't that great, and the rent is super high, which I think is a bit unfair. Since they're close to the campus, the management of those buildings can get away with charging us exorbitant rent. There's this really cheap restaurant just a few minutes from my place that serves food on paper plates and most of it is microwaved. Across from that place is a gas station, which I've heard isn't a great place to work. However, thanks to some funding from the city, the road was renovated last summer, so now there's a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and the area looks a bit better. But my apartment building is actually pretty shaded, with lots of trees around it. They cut down a few of them, so there are a few stumps left behind, but there are still a lot of trees around my place compared to the other street. Behind my apartment complex is a row of trees, and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind it is 43rd street, and that one's not as nice. The sidewalks on that street are pretty bad and are falling apart, and most of the buildings look pretty run-down. There are a lot of trees on that street, but it's probably just to hide the state of the buildings. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but I don't think it's fair to blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But overall, I like living here. The rent is affordable, and there are plenty of useful amenities nearby, including the university, which is within walking distance, and there are two bus stops so I can easily get to the store and downtown.",
            "My current neighborhood is comprised of rows of duplex's in a cul-de-sac. They appear to be individual houses due to the intermittent placement and spacing, although they are painted the same, with yellow walls, white porches, and green metal roofs. Most of the residents are on friendly terms with one another, which adds to the communal atmosphere. Every evening, some of us stand at the end of our driveways and engage in casual conversations while the kids in the neighborhood play with their toys, create art with sidewalk chalk, or fly their kites. This setting is a refreshing escape from the monotony of the modern world, which is dominated by technology and computers. It's as if we're living in a bygone era. The surroundings are picturesque, with fields and trees accompanied by blue skies and puffy white clouds. However, this season has brought us tornado warnings, and for the first time, we actually heard the tornado sirens last night, prompting us to seek shelter. I, along with my little dog, found myself in the bathtub, clutching my purse and a few pillows. My larger dog, however, remained in the living room, whining and barking nervously due to the unusual circumstances. The neighborhood was eerily quiet, except for the sound of large hail pounding against the ground. After the storm passed, the road was steaming due to the dramatic temperature change, with the hail melting as soon as it hit the hot pavement. As I gazed up at the clearing skies, the sun broke through, and it began to rain. A double rainbow appeared, and I quickly ran inside to grab my camera to capture the moment. I shared the photos with my friends and family on Facebook, and they were just as amazed as I was. The streets remained quiet for another hour before people started returning home, and then it was back to normal – moms and kids outside, dinner being cooked. I've grown to adore this friendly neighborhood, especially the southern accent that's become music to my ears. Although all the houses appear identical on the outside, each apartment has its own unique layout and charm. Some are surprisingly small, which I find hard to understand. I enjoy taking leisurely walks through the largest field behind my home and strolling down to the pond, which isn't suitable for swimming. I've spotted deer, and in the mornings, you can hear the deep, resonant song of the bullfrog. It's a fantastic place to live, just a forty-minute drive away from the city of Charlotte. Each morning is a beautiful start, accompanied by the sounds of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It's as if we're living in a small, self-contained community. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that lets out a distinctive bray in the evenings, serving as a gentle reminder of his presence. I feel fortunate to have found this hidden gem of a neighborhood.",
            "It was my first day of eighth grade when I moved into this neighborhood. Making friends wasn't easy at first, but luckily I connected with two of my neighbors - one living two houses down and another on my street. Unfortunately, they've since moved away, but the memories still linger. To my surprise, most of the original residents who welcomed me when I first arrived are still here. Our neighborhood is pretty much your typical American suburban setup - rows of two-story houses and the usual sounds of kids playing outside on warm days. Weekends are usually pretty quiet, but when it's warm, you can hear the laughter of kids outside. I've been fortunate to have never had any issues with my neighbors, and it's clear that this is a community where you're left alone unless you genuinely need help. Online deliveries have become a norm, and I've ordered multiple times without ever having a package go missing from my porch. This speaks volumes about the trust my neighbors have in each other. A park just a minute or two away has been a hub for some of my fondest memories, including playing basketball, football, and baseball with my neighborhood friends. However, it's also where I suffered a painful injury when I got elbowed in the nose during a football game. The good memories far outweigh the bad, though. Nowadays, I visit the park to spend quality time with my cousin's younger kids, who still love playing on the swings and slides. Watching them brings back a mix of emotions, making me nostalgic for my past experiences there. The neighborhood is a melting pot of cultures, with an array of cuisines nearby. Just within a one-mile radius, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants, as well as plenty of fast-food shops and pizza places. Online food delivery services like GrubHub and DoorDash have become increasingly popular, though. The local stores cater to all our needs, with multiple dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store on the same street. There's even an Indian-owned store for those who crave homemade or ready-made Indian food. After seeing the unfortunate stories of neighborly conflicts on social media and news, I feel grateful to live in a neighborhood where I can trust my neighbors.",
            "My hometown is a charming little town in South Carolina that doesn't stand out from the rest, but it's a significant contributor to the agriculture sector. Johnston claims to be the Peach Capital of the World, a title proudly displayed on the town's welcoming sign. Its main landscape consists of farmland where peach trees and cattle dominate the scene. Houses, mostly two-story affairs with metal or gray roofs to combat the scorching summer heat, are scattered throughout the outskirts of town. They're often set back from the road, allowing the front fields to be used for grazing animals and crops. The central part of town features a single stoplight at an intersection, where the few shops are located. A small Chinese restaurant called Hong Kong, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a local burger chain, offer limited dining options. A former pizzeria has since closed down. There's a small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug, famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola. A tiny grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, is the town's sole grocery store, but many residents prefer to shop at the nearby Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville. However, the most bustling spot in town is Dollar General, which sells a vast array of everyday items and is always crowded from opening to closing. A small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind-hearted woman, has been a staple in Johnston for years and even employs delivery services. Adjacent to the furniture store is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet groomer offering various services. Both a doctor's office and a veterinary clinic are located outside the main town area, providing essential services to the residents. The town has a single elementary school, Johnston Elementary School, but students attend middle and high school in the next town over after completing the fifth grade. Although there aren't many recreational activities, the town is working on creating a 2.5-acre recreational area to attract visitors and potential residents. While it's a quiet town with limited amenities, it's still a pleasant place to live, so small that you could easily miss it in the blink of an eye.",
            "The first time I heard about my neighborhood, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It caught me off guard. Almost every apartment in the area was renting for over a thousand dollars a month, but I'd never heard anything about this story. Neither had my friends. It's like the darkness that settles in when you're struggling. I know some of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night due to financial struggles. We've learned to be thrifty over the years, but it's funny how you start to appreciate the smell of second-hand items and old clothes. You even start to enjoy the smell of stale air. As an adult, you might start smoking or just get used to the way things are. But the thrift stores in my area never fail to remind me of this reality. There are three within walking distance, and if you start from the far end, you'll find charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. The townscape may be chaotic, with cars and people packed into the streets every morning, but the thrift stores are always quiet. It's the perfect place to lose an afternoon. Every year, the city grows more crowded with cars and people. It's a developing city, they say, and it's home to one of the largest e-commerce empires. It reminds me of New York, where everyone's focused on their goals and nobody bothers you. You can keep to yourself, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where people seem to pry into your life. In this city, you can keep your shell intact, and the city will just roll on like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be, with the pianist next door and the amateur vocalists upstairs always creating something new. We don't live in a typical apartment of strangers; instead, we're a community of friends who come together for birthdays, funerals, and when we need help. I'm lucky to be here, and I really like most of my neighbors. We look out for each other, clean up after ourselves, and share food and mail. It's nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. Despite living in a massive modernist sprawl, my neighbors make me feel like I haven't completely messed up my life.",
            "I live in a typical suburban area, nothing out of the ordinary. My neighborhood is like a cookie cutter version of suburban living. Everywhere you look, you'll see well-maintained single family homes, thanks to our homeowner's association. The front yards all share a similar theme: a small patch of neatly cut grass, some decorative pebbles, and short driveways. You'll also spot small trees scattered here and there. Every house has two-car garages. As you drive through the neighborhood, you'll notice newly paved concrete roads in excellent condition – no potholes or bumps in sight. Most of the homes are one-story, but some have two stories as well. What sets our neighborhood apart is the mail system. Instead of individual mailboxes in front of each house, we have a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street that require a key to access. We also have two big package lockers, courtesy of our HOA's love for uniformity. Our neighborhood is on the outskirts of the nearby city, so it's a mix of rural and suburban living. We have plenty of open land and a range of amenities, including multiple community pools that are well-maintained and gated. There are also walking trails where you can take your dog for a walk or go for a solo evening stroll. Exercise isn't a problem here – you can simply run around the neighborhood and get your daily dose of exercise. Our community is predominantly made up of retirees, but we also have a mix of middle-aged and young professionals. The city itself is surprisingly large, with a small-town feel. We have all the amenities you'd expect, including a single mall that may not be huge, but gets the job done. It takes me about 15 minutes to drive to anywhere significant, but once I get there, I have access to a variety of stores, from high-end grocery stores to bargain outlets. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty standard – we have our nice touches like pools and walking trails, and while we're not right next door to any shopping centers, it's an easy drive to get to any major chain store I want.",
            "I reside in a small Midwestern town situated just outside the suburban outskirts of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, located on the east side, is considered the most economically disadvantaged area within the town. Property values are on the lower side, with most houses rented or owned by low-income individuals, yet it's far from unattractive or unpleasant. The people in my neighborhood are generally friendly and always greet me with a smile when I walk down the street. Crime rates are slightly higher than in other parts of town, but still relatively low. In the past decade, a few violent crimes have occurred close to my home, including shootings and a homicide. Our next-door neighbors recently lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar. Fortunately, my family hasn't been directly affected by crime, except for occasionally losing items from our porch when we forget to bring them inside. Our town has been greatly impacted by the \"opioid epidemic\" affecting many parts of the United States. Unfortunately, many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are numerous resources available to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those struggling with addiction. Despite the challenges, my town has many positive qualities. My son's elementary school has an excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. He has special needs, yet he hasn't faced any bullying due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he truly loves attending. We have an active PTO that organizes multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Given that over 20% of our town's population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child ever goes hungry. No child or family is treated as less than due to financial constraints, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are reasonable. The City Council and staff have implemented various improvements to our town's appearance, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the town center and on the west side, where shopping areas are located and most traffic passes through. In contrast, the east side, where I live, tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for my neighbors and me. Despite these issues, I genuinely enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are excellent, there are sufficient shopping options to meet my family's needs, and while our home may not be worth much, it is comfortable and suitable. We've lived here for over 16 years, and it's hard to imagine calling anywhere else home.",
            "My neighborhood is a vibrant cultural hub, nestled on a hill surrounded by buildings steeped in history. I live in a 7-story apartment building right opposite the old theater, and just down the road, you'll find a trendy arcade bar that draws in a diverse crowd on warm summer evenings. The line of people waiting to get in is a common sight, especially during weekends in June and July. A short walk up is the city park, a decent size considering its location. The park is encircled by concrete, with steep stairs carved into the wall. During the harsh winter months, you'll see homeless people setting up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and wide steps. Although it doesn't snow often, the heavy rainfall in mid-winter can be challenging to cope with. By setting their tents close together in the city center, they stay relatively warmer. They're also close to the local family center, where they can access basic necessities like showers and baths. What I love about my city isn't its historic architecture or the hills that roll down to the ocean. It's the people themselves who make my neighborhood so special. You see, Hilltop was once notorious for gang violence on the West Coast, and stories of federal officials and the DEA sweeping through the area still circulate today. The community still remembers those days. Despite being considered one of the rougher neighborhoods in the city, the people work hard to keep it clean and safe. They still care about what happens in their area, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill at night, but I think this warning is a relic of the past, tainted with social conditioning. Perhaps it's because I blend in as a 'not-so-white' person, or maybe the Hilltop community recognizes me as one of their own, someone who's just as aware of the reminders that plague our nation. These reminders are a result of racism, cultural conditioning, and ignorance-fueled assumptions, even in a city that prides itself as a cultural melting pot. I know one thing: no matter where life takes me, Hilltop will always be home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who've shown me kindness and compassion, even when I needed it most. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open late to charge my phone when I was stranded in the rain. It's a place where I've sat, feeling invisible, huddled against a concrete storefront on a bleak night, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I reside in Rural America, a small town in Michigan. The landscape here is a beautiful mix of farmland and quaint tourist cities. We don't have the big city luxuries like malls, chain stores like Wal-mart or Target, or even a fancy restaurant like Applebee's. Everything you need is within driving distance. Despite this, our little town is surrounded by breathtaking natural beauty - the stunning waters of Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Every corner of our \"city\" offers access to a beach where you can dip your toes in the water. Our neighborhood perfectly embodies the essence of small-town life. Houses are spread out, not towering on top of each other like in big cities. They're a mix of old and new, with some homes dating back years and others beautifully renovated. Most houses have full basements that are visible from the road, giving them a charming, down-to-earth feel. The neighborhood is a kaleidoscope of colors, with houses painted in every hue imaginable. Yards are a common feature, with trampolines, playsets, and even gardens and fences for pets. The atmosphere is quintessentially Middle American - hardworking folks striving to make a living, some raising families and others having already done so. On any given day, you'll see kids running up and down the streets, people walking their dogs, biking, or rollerblading. Neighbors know and look out for one another, and you can quickly tell who's part of the community and who's an outsider. You'll see people grilling in their front yards, waving at passersby, or walking their dogs and exchanging pleasantries with neighbors a few blocks away. Lawns are well-maintained, with neatly trimmed grass and tidy gardens. It's not a neighborhood that will leave you awestruck, but one that exudes a sense of comfort and security. It's a quiet, peaceful place where you can feel safe, and that's exactly what people want in life. Within walking distance, you'll find the county sheriff's department, the health department, and the recycling center, which serves the entire city. We have baseball and softball fields nearby, where you can hear the announcers calling out the names of players and keeping score. The small town airport is just a stone's throw away, and you can often hear the sound of small planes taking off and landing. You can also walk to the local ice cream shop or head downtown from our neighborhood. My kids can ride their bikes to the nearby park, which is just an 8-block ride away. It's a wonderful place to call home."
