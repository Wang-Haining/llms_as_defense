            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "We were driving through an endless expanse of cornfields as she gazed out at the horizon in awe. \"Where are we?\" she asked, taken aback by the vast open space. I chuckled, knowing she'd be shocked by the stark contrast to her hometown where the grocery store was just a stone's throw away. I shared with her what it was like growing up in rural Ohio, where the cornfields stretched as far as the eye could see. In that moment, she finally got a glimpse of who I was and where I came from.\n\nAs we drove down the winding country road, the landscape gave way to a quarry filled with water, and then a small development that was home.

It was my childhood playground, where I spent my days building tree forts, \"hunting\" imaginary prey, and making friends with the kids from the neighbourhood.

The yard would transform from a lush green to a barren wilderness, and the trees that once bloomed with vibrant flowers would stand as skeletal sentinels of bark. And when snow fell, a winter wonderland would appear overnight, complete with snow angels and snowmen crafted by my little sister.

            "First off, to truly grasp the essence of Portland, Oregon, one must understand the meaning behind \"weird\". The phrase, which adorns a building that serves multiple purposes like a pizza joint, bar, music venue, and more, is an unofficial town slogan that goes by \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, it's a nostalgic call to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's - a time when the city was less known and less crowded, fostering unique and creative subcultures. To others, it's an invitation to visit a place where being called \"weird\" is considered a badge of honor.\n\nDespite the influx of affluent Californians and the rise of condominiums, Portland still maintains its offbeat charm. Being \"weird\" in Portland doesn't necessarily mean accepting anything, but rather embracing differences that are often shunned by society. We're not immune to modern conveniences and conflicts like the rest of the country, as we import most of our goods from China. However, there are countless ways to be \"weird\" or \"not normal\" in Portland, and we have our fair share of normalcy too. You'll find yoga enthusiasts, hipsters, and business professionals living alongside the rest of us.\n\nPerhaps what makes Portland truly \"weird\" is that we don't take ourselves too seriously. In my neighborhood, like many others, you'll spot colorful houses, vibrant home gardens, and free boxes lining the streets during the summer months. Free boxes typically contain items people are getting rid of, but they can be anything from clothes and books to unexpected treasures. The thrill of discovering something valuable in a free box is a big part of what makes Portland special, and it's a feeling that's unique to each neighborhood in the city.\n\nPortland has its quirkiness, and I'm just one example of the many weird and wonderful residents here. Some people I live among wouldn't dream of rummaging through boxes on the sidewalk, opting instead for activities like goat yoga or cheering on the city's soccer team at a Timbers match. What I love about Portland is its diversity - people here pursue their passions, whether it's starting a business, playing music, or simply enjoying a cold beer at the bar.\n\nOf course, like any city, Portland has its problems. We struggle with a drug issue that often stems from underlying mental health issues, and the constant rain doesn't help. We also have a homelessness problem that's a challenge to solve, with services that are insufficient but still better than in many other parts of the country. The non-homeless population is torn between feeling empathy and frustration towards the homeless. In this regard, Portland is not so \"weird\" after all.",
            "The mountains stand tall, a constant presence in the north, silently witnessing the passage of time as the sun rises and sets each day. Irrespective of how engrossed I am in work or life, they persist, unyielding to the ebbs and flows of life's turmoil. On days when I'm overwhelmed with stress and anxiety, they beckon me, and when I turn to them, they offer a respite, lending me the strength to carry on, one day at a time. It was during my undergraduate days that I first discovered their allure. While the university campus boasts its own share of breathtaking views, the mountains that lie to the north of the campus have an enduring hold on my heart. The university's charm, with its beautiful buildings, ponds, and trees, has won a part of my affection, but it's the mountains that hold the top spot. The rest of the town is equally captivating, with its array of quaint cafés where I spent countless hours fueled by caffeine and determination. A short walk or bus ride takes you to the downtown area, where the faded brick facades transport you to a bygone era, infusing the air with an aura of antiquity. Amidst this blend of suburban tranquility and urban vigor, the town presents a unique charm, an invitation to explore. The juxtaposition of these contrasting atmospheres within close proximity creates a captivating essence, as if beckoning me to uncover its secrets. With time, I've accumulated numerous cherished memories, each tied to a specific part of town, whether it's walking past the rusted swings in the park after a sleepless night with friends or racing through the bustling downtown to catch a movie that the university had provided tickets for. Alas, life has also bestowed upon me numerous harsh memories, a universal aspect of our experiences. The ponds, in particular, have come to serve as a poignant reminder of my introspective moments, as well as the many tears I've shed in the dead of night, grappling with existential crises. While watching the turtles, ducks, and insects live their lives, each with a role to play, I couldn't help but ponder my own purpose as I navigated the complexities of life. As I strolled past the pond, the park, and the quaint houses that epitomize suburban life, I eventually reached the main street, where the sun's rays danced across the palm trees, casting a kaleidoscope of colors across the sky. In that moment, as I gazed up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. And there they were – the mountains, steadfast and resolute, their presence speaking volumes, stirring within me a sense of resilience.",
            "Bensonhurst, Brooklyn - it's no secret that finding your way here is a breeze, thanks to the excellent public transportation system that's as accessible as it is convenient. As one of New York City's most popular forms of transportation, you'll find it easy to get around. With Bensonhurst being a bustling urban neighborhood, you'll still get that quintessential NYC vibe. During your visit, get ready to be surrounded by the numerous Asian stores that seem to be on every corner. It's no coincidence that this neighborhood has become a hub for Asian inhabitants over the past two decades, which is reflected in the abundance of Asian-owned stores. Supermarkets and laundromats are the most popular, and for good reason - they offer top-notch food, unbeatable prices, and unparalleled convenience. Just a stone's throw away from where I am, there are no less than four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walking distance from each other, making grocery shopping a total cinch.\n\nDon't get me wrong, Bensonhurst isn't a sea of Asian faces - it's a melting pot of cultures, with immigrants and their American-born children calling the neighborhood home. The majority of local businesses are still Asian-owned, though, and it's not uncommon to see families and friends of all ages enjoying the vibrant atmosphere. Just a short walk away, you'll find a newly renovated park that's a gem of the neighborhood. With ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for the summer months, there's something for everyone. As you'd expect in New York City, the park is a haven for diversity, and people of all ages and backgrounds come together to play and socialize.\n\nIn terms of housing, you won't find any large corporate buildings here - instead, co-op living and condominium apartments are the norm, with most residents calling two-family houses home. While the majority of people are friendly and welcoming, be prepared for some noise pollution. You'll often hear cars blasting their music, or people flooring it down the road, which can be a bit jarring. If you're visiting at night, it's a good idea to keep your wits about you - while Bensonhurst is generally a safe neighborhood, you never know when you might encounter someone looking for trouble. I've had my own run-ins with bullies and package thieves, but these incidents were a while back. Just remember to keep your shoes clean and be mindful of your surroundings!",
            "My home is nestled at the top of a steep hill, and I'm surrounded by a neighborhood with a unique landscape. People often call it the \"workout hill\" because joggers love to tackle the incline. Since there are no sidewalks, everyone walks on the road, which is a bit hazardous with its potholes and uneven surface. The street's lined with worn-out telephone and electric wires, which are frequently damaged by falling branches and debris from the many storms we get. Evergreen trees abound, but surprisingly, most people here dislike them, as they obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many houses are built high up on the hill, with large glass windows to take in the stunning view of the bay. Watching the sunset is breathtaking, with the water glowing from below and the sky turning orange. However, it's often cloudy, so the sunlight's filtered through a haze. The atmosphere's usually overcast and damp, which contributes to the lush growth of moss on everything – roofs, cars, and even railings. I once left my car in the driveway for a month, and when I returned, it was covered in a thick layer of moss that took me three hours to scrub off. Our neighborhood's relatively quiet, with only a few kids around, thanks to a school nearby. The majority of residents are retired folks, and instead of kids, we have plenty of dogs roaming around. It's not uncommon to see them lounging in people's lawns or racing down the street. If you leave a door or window open, they might sneak in, like when I once found one lounging in my living room and had to shoo it out. Rabbits are also abundant, and they love to dig up plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats have helped keep them under control, though. We also have a variety of birds, including small sparrows and hummingbirds, and occasionally, a hawk or eagle will swoop by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. While we don't have any stores nearby, a short hike down to the waterfront leads to a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. The beach itself isn't extensive, but the rocks along the shore make for fun skipping stones into the water. On most days, you can see the opposite shoreline clearly through the mist.",
            "I've been living in a typical suburban area in a small town in Tennessee for a while now. Our street is situated between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic than I'd like, but other than that, it's a pretty quiet neighborhood. We're not used to having many new faces around here, so I've gotten to know most of the regulars. Folks usually spend their time tending to their lawns and daily chores. In the winter, we enjoy sledding down the hill on our side street. Since we live in a house at the corner of our street, we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that roll through here. Whenever we spot a strange vehicle, we tend to take notice. Some of the neighbors like to take a stroll for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids are always out on their bikes, and you can hear the usual sounds of a small town. As we work from home, we're mostly at home, along with my wife and our two daughters, ages eleven and fourteen. So, it's no surprise that everyone else is used to seeing us come and go. We enjoy spending time outdoors, even when it's raining, and sometimes we fire up the grill on our back deck, filling the air with the delicious smell of barbecue. You can almost always hear the sound of lawn mowers from March to October, when the grass finally stops growing. Our neighborhood used to be wooded, so there are plenty of trees providing shade, but that also means raking and burning leaves every year in the Fall. I must admit, the smell of burning leaves is one of my favorites – it's a sure sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not had much of a Winter, so it feels like it's been one long Fall. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone knocks on the door, which is a rare occurrence. I like to tinker with my truck or other projects in the garage, and when the doors are open, it feels like I'm more connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, things are pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving and other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas bring some extra visitors, and you can spot more cars parked along the street. All in all, I'm quite happy living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "Yesterday, I found myself pondering about my neighborhood, situated smack dab in the middle of the high desert. The endless expanse of brown dirt stretches out before me, a constant reminder of the harsh yet beautiful environment I call home. Unless you've experienced living here firsthand, it's hard to comprehend the monotony of gazing out at the same dull landscape day in and day out. But when you do chance upon a well-manicured lawn, you know that person has invested a small fortune in lawn care. I've lived in this area since the 90s, and although the houses have sprouted up around me, the layout still feels largely the same. In fact, it's a bit eerie how much this place resembles a city, yet, like many other places, it's undergoing rapid transformation. The locals are generally friendly, but, just like any city, there's a mix of the good and the not-so-good. I'm surrounded by friendly elderly folks, which makes my neighborhood feel like a nicer community. The local stores are mostly chain stores, like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final, but if you're looking for upscale options, you're better off traveling elsewhere. I rarely see any Whole Foods or boutiques around here. The dominant industries in my city appear to be construction, given its relatively underdeveloped state and the abundance of open spaces waiting to be built upon. This thought unsettles me, as I prefer things the way they are now. I left behind a big city and don't fancy going back. My full-time job is in the construction field, specifically as a drywall and T-bar installer, which means I'm somewhat invested in its growth. What I appreciate about my home, however, is the unique wildlife. People flock to the high desert for its breathtaking beauty, and the challenging ecosystems it supports have created an opportunity for various species to thrive. It's essential for human residents to learn about and respect the non-human inhabitants of this environment to coexist peacefully. My family and I have adapted well to the wildlife, and my kids are particularly fascinated by lizards and desert bugs. As I write this, they're outside, trying to catch different specimens. As for attractions, we have a few gems. Victorville is a great destination for families looking to experience the desert, and if you plan your visit to coincide with the annual San Bernardino County Fair, you'll have a fantastic time. The fair offers an excellent mix of activities and fun, showcasing the Victorville way. If you're looking for a winter sports fix, head over to Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and take a lesson or two. Lastly, the Victor Valley Museum is a treasure trove of geological, paleontological, and Native American artifacts that provide valuable insights into the history and development of the high desert ecosystem.",
            "My neighborhood might sound like everyone else's, but trust me, it's unique. Unlike others who probably live in their own individual houses, I consider my neighborhood to be the campus I'm on and the people in my dormitory as my community. The surrounding campus is part of my neighborhood too, although it's not as central as the dorm. Despite being a bit unusual, my neighborhood shares some familiar traits with the typical idea of a neighborhood. Just like any normal neighborhood, it's got houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's dive into the 'houses' that make up my neighborhood. Before I do, I need to clarify the types of houses we have here. There are three kinds: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory houses. Apartments usually have 2-4 people in each room, with 4-6 rooms per floor, and about 20 people in each building. The actual houses are a bit rare, with 2-4 bedrooms, mostly occupied by alumni. Then there are the dorm rooms, where hundreds of students live, with each room housing 2 people, except in some cases. They're the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. Now, let's talk about the people. My school is proud of its diversity, and it shows in the neighborhood. You'll find people from all cultures and ages here. Professionals usually live in the houses, while new students are in dorms, and older students are in apartments. We can't do the people justice, so let's move on to the stores and park. Since my school is a mini-neighborhood, it has plenty of stores and a single park. The stores offer a mix of dining options and the school's unique brand of clothes and groceries. You can find anything you need within our neighborhood's boundaries. The park is our playground, kept clean and safe by everyone in the community.",
            "I've been living in this neighborhood for about 10 years now, so I guess it's time for me to share some stories about it. When I first moved here from Riverdale to Stockbridge, I was pretty sad because I missed my old home and the people I loved. My mom and dad made the tough decision to move us to a better neighborhood for a better life, a better school, and a safer environment. It wasn't easy, but I eventually got used to it and made some new friends, as well as some new enemies in school. To be honest, I never really got to know my neighbors that well, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and to a lesser extent, Dennis, who lived right next door. They've been like a family to me, and I feel grateful for having them in my life. I remember attending Mr. Glen's wedding, which was a great experience, and something I hope to replicate in my own life someday. When Ms. Veda threw off her prosthetic leg strap during the wedding, I managed to catch it, but unfortunately not the flowers. We danced the night away, and I had a blast with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I've lost touch with her since, but I hope she's doing well. The neighborhood can be confusing, but now that I have a GPS, I've been exploring it more. I've hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis a few times, and we used to spend hours playing video games and enjoying life. I also love visiting the park and appreciating nature, which helps me feel more calm and at peace. I often take sticks from Home Depot and practice my balance, and I enjoy wielding my bokken wooden sword. There are also a basketball and tennis court nearby, although I haven't played either sport in a while. My dad used to coach me and my best friend in tennis with Mr. Graves, and those were some of the best times. They pushed us hard, but we always had fun. Looking back, I've had a lot of fun in this neighborhood, and there are plenty of stories I could share, but these are the ones that stand out to me. I'm excited to see what the future holds.",
            "I'm really lucky to be living near the college I attend, and I think that's one of the best things about where I live. My neighborhood is pretty chill, with mostly apartment buildings and a few fun, affordable bars and restaurants to hang out at. One of the bars has just changed its name, but it's still not too pricey and the service and drinks are alright. Most of the people around here are either students or lower-income folks who can afford the apartments, which is pretty cool. You can hear the sound of kids playing since there's an elementary school nearby, within walking distance of my place. To be honest, I don't really know my neighbors - they're a bit too into smoking weed, and the management installed an air freshener unit right outside their door, which my boyfriend and I thought was pretty funny. It's almost like they're trying to send a message. The buildings around me are a bit old-fashioned, but they might have been renovated on the inside. Down the street, there are brand new apartments, but I'm not a fan - they're super cheaply built but the rent is way too high, which I think is just taking advantage of people. Since they're close to campus, though, the management gets away with it. There's this one super cheap eatery about a 5-minute walk from my place that only serves food on paper plates and most of their dishes are microwaved. Across from that is a gas station that's not exactly the best place to work. But thanks to some city funding, they redid the road last summer, so now we have a nice big sidewalk, some grass on the median and the sides, and the area looks a lot nicer. The apartment building I live in has a lot of trees around it, but they cut some down, so now there are a few stumps left. There are way more trees where I live than down the street. Behind my apartment complex is a line of trees and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street, which isn't as nice. The sidewalks are in bad shape and the buildings look pretty shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but I think they're just trying to hide the state of the buildings. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but I don't blame them entirely - there are other apartments across the street with their own problems and a pretty transient population. Despite all this, I really like where I live. It's affordable, and there are plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially love that the university is within walking distance, and there are two bus stops so I can easily get to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood is a haven of colorful duplexes nestled in a cul-de-sac. The houses are spread out in a way that makes them seem like individual homes, with only one notable difference - each one is painted a cheerful yellow, adorned with white porches and green metal roofs. While not everyone is close friends, there's a sense of camaraderie that permeates the air. On some evenings, you'll find us gathered at the end of a driveway, chatting and laughing as the kids play with their toys, sidewalk chalk, or fly their kites. It's a refreshing escape from the hustle and bustle of the modern world, a step back in time when life was simpler. The surrounding fields and trees are a stunning backdrop, set against a brilliant blue sky with puffy white clouds. However, this season has brought a new challenge - tornado warnings, which recently culminated in our first-ever experience of actual sirens blaring, prompting us to seek shelter. I was huddled in my bathtub with my smallest dog and some essentials, while my bigger dog stayed put in the living room, anxious and barking. The neighborhood was eerily quiet, except for the sound of large hail pounding the ground. After the storm, the temperature dropped dramatically, and the road was suddenly steaming hot. The hail melted instantly on the pavement as the sun broke through the clearing skies and a double rainbow appeared. I dashed inside to grab my camera and snapped some pictures to share with my friends and family on Facebook - they were as amazed as I was. It took about an hour for the streets to return to normal, and soon the familiar sounds of mom's cooking and children's laughter filled the air. I've grown to love this friendly community, especially the warm Southern accents that fill the air. My two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment is just like everyone else's on the outside, but each one has its unique character on the inside. It's puzzling why some apartments are so small, but it's a minor quirk in an otherwise idyllic setting. I adore strolling through the vast field behind my home, meandering down to the pond that's not meant for swimming. I've spotted deer and even heard the majestic bullfrog's morning serenade. It's a fantastic place to live, just a 40-minute drive from the city of Charlotte. Every morning begins with the cheerful sound of roosters crowing from the nearby farms, creating a sense of community that's hard to find in the city. We even have a friendly donkey at a nearby farm that brays in the evening, reminding us of its presence. I feel lucky to have discovered this hidden gem of a neighborhood.",
            "I stepped into my new neighborhood just as I was about to enter the world of eighth grade. At first, it was tough to connect with the locals, but fate had other plans, and I formed a bond with a guy living right next door and another fellow on my street. Although they're no longer around, the memories remain vivid. The people who were here when I first arrived are still here, giving our neighborhood a sense of continuity. Our neighborhood is just like any other American suburban neighborhood, with rows of two-story houses lining the streets. You can hear the sound of kids playing outside on weekends or whenever the sun is out, and the neighborhood is generally quiet on most weekdays. I've never had any issues with my neighbors, and I feel like I can trust them completely. When I order packages online, they always arrive safely on my porch. Our neighborhood is the kind of place where you're left alone unless you need help.\n\nJust a minute or two away from my house is a park that holds a special place in my heart. I've spent countless hours playing basketball, football, and baseball there with the guys from the neighborhood. One of my not-so-fond memories also happened there when I got elbowed in the nose during a football game, but the good times far outweigh the bad. Nowadays, I visit the park with my cousin's kids, who are a lot younger and still enjoy the simple joys of swings and slides. Just thinking about heading to the park gets them excited. The park is now a source of nostalgia for me, reminding me of the good old days.\n\nOur neighborhood is a melting pot of cultures, with a wide variety of food options nearby. Within a one-mile radius, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, with the rise of food delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash, many people prefer to have their meals delivered to their doorstep. The most popular food places are the fast food chains, but you can find those in many suburban neighborhoods. There are also plenty of pizza places to choose from. Our stores have everything you need, with multiple dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store on the same street. Some stores even cater to different tastes, like an Indian-owned store for those who want to cook up some homemade Indian dishes or buy pre-made meals.\n\nI'm grateful for my neighborhood, especially after reading about the horror stories of people dealing with difficult neighbors on social media. It's a blessing to have a community like mine.",
            "My hometown is a quaint little place in South Carolina, blending seamlessly into the rest of the landscape. It's not particularly famous, but it's made its mark in the agricultural sector, thanks to its status as the Peach Capital of the World, proudly displayed on the town's welcoming sign. The town is primarily composed of vast farmlands dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses on the outskirts of town are spaced far apart, mostly two-story structures with metal roofs to shield them from the scorching summer heat or gray shingles. Most homes are nestled away from the main road, allowing the front fields to be used for raising animals or growing crops. Downtown, the town's single traffic light hangs at a four-way intersection, marking the spot where the local stores are concentrated. There are a few eateries where you can grab fast food: Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a local family; Fiesta Mexican Restaurant; or Gary's, a small burger chain. A pizzeria once called the town home, but it closed its doors a while back. The Maxwell and Halford Drug pharmacy is a family-owned business, and it's famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola; not many people know that, though. IGA, a small, pricey grocery store, is the only one in town, but many residents prefer to shop at a Walmart in the nearby Batesburg-Leesville for most of their grocery needs. Dollar General, however, is the most popular spot in town, offering a wide range of everyday items and bustling with activity from opening to closing. Possibilities Furniture & More, a quaint furniture store run by a well-respected woman in the community, has been a part of the town for years and even employs two movers to deliver purchased furniture. Next door, Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a small pet groomer, offers various services, including daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and more. The town has two small medical practices, one for humans and one for animals, located outside the main part of town. Johnston Elementary School is the town's only elementary school, and students usually move on to middle and high school in the next town over after completing fifth grade. Although there aren't any parks in town, the local government is in the process of creating a 2.5-acre recreational area to provide families with more opportunities to spend time together and attract new residents. It's a quiet town, with limited entertainment options – no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or \"hangout\" spots, but it's a nice place, so small it's easy to miss while driving by.",
            "I first heard about my neighborhood through a podcast featuring people who'd gone missing in the area. It was quite surprising to hear. Almost every apartment in the place was renting for over a thousand dollars a month – something none of my friends and I had ever heard about. I guess that's what happens when you're struggling. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night due to financial burdens. We've learned to be frugal over the years, though. You start to appreciate the dusty smell of second-hand toys and mothballed clothes. As you grow older, you come to notice you smell less as well. Some people might start smoking, while others just get accustomed to the state of things. However, the flea market always finds a way to assert itself. The smell of adulthood is that of dusty magazines piled on a closed piano, which even persists after you wash it. In my area, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start from the far side, you can visit two charity thrift stores, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling with cars and people every morning, but you'd never hear the noise in the thrift stores. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the stores remain quiet. It's a great place to lose an afternoon. Every year, the downtown area gets more crowded with cars and people. It's a growing city, they say. One of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery is based here, and it's still showing signs of growth pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is focused on their own goals, and people generally don't pry into one another's lives. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. This is different from the South, where being a little concerned means showing you care. Here, people respect your personal space and won't intrude unless you invite them to. It's a lively and welcoming place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment full of strangers and more of a community of friends who come together for our needs, celebrate our birthdays, mourn our losses, and help each other when we can. I'm fortunate to live here. I quite like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I try to clean up after myself and leave food for them, and they do the same for me. I bring their mail and they bring mine. It's nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. Despite living in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl, it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I haven't completely messed up my life.",
            "I live in a typical suburban area that looks like it's been cut out from a cookie cutter. You can't help but notice the presence of a homeowner's association when you first enter the neighborhood. The streets are filled with well-maintained single-family homes, all thanks to the HOA's hard work. The front yards are almost identical, with a small patch of grass, some decorative pebbles, and short driveways. You'll occasionally spot small trees and two-car garages. As you drive through the neighborhood, you'll notice newly paved concrete roads with no potholes in sight. Most houses are single-story, but some have two stories. One thing that stands out is the mailbox system – instead of individual mailboxes in front of each house, there's a large group of mailboxes at the end of the street, and you need a key to access your specific one. There are also two larger lockers for packages. The HOA's love for uniformity is really evident here. My house is located on the outskirts of the nearby city, so my neighborhood feels like a mix of rural and suburban areas. As a result, we have plenty of space for everything – there are multiple community pools that are well-maintained and gated, as well as walking trails where you can take your dog or go for a solo evening stroll. You don't even need to go to a park to get some exercise; just take a run around the neighborhood and you'll get enough. The community is mostly made up of retired people, but we also have a few middle-aged and young professionals living here. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for each other. We have a small town feel despite being part of a larger city, and we have most of the amenities you'd expect – except for one mall, which is surprisingly sufficient. It takes around 15 minutes to drive to anywhere significant, but once you get there, you have access to a variety of stores, from high-end grocery stores to bargain outlets. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty standard – we have our perks, like pools and walking trails, but we're not exactly next door to a shopping district, so you just hop in the car and head to any major chain store you want.",
            "Living in a small Midwestern town just outside the city's suburbs has its unique charm. Our neighborhood on the town's east side, where I reside, is often regarded as the most economically disadvantaged area. Property values are low, with many homes rented or owned by low-income families, yet this doesn't define the community's character. The friendly neighbors I've encountered smile and greet me as I walk down the street, giving our area a welcoming atmosphere.\n\nWhile crime rates are slightly higher than in other parts of town, they remain relatively low. Unfortunately, there have been a few violent incidents nearby, including shootings and a homicide, which shook our community. Our next-door neighbors suffered a personal loss when their son was killed outside a local bar. Fortunately, our family has been spared from direct harm, apart from occasional incidents of theft when we forget to bring items inside.\n\nThe town as a whole has been heavily impacted by the opioid epidemic, which has ravaged many parts of the United States. The loss of lives due to fentanyl overdoses has been devastating. Thankfully, our town has made efforts to combat this crisis through addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected.\n\nDespite these challenges, our town has many redeeming qualities. My son's elementary school boasts an exceptional staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff, creating a positive and supportive environment. His special needs haven't hindered his experience, and he loves attending school. The active Parent-Teacher Organization (PTO) organizes numerous events to foster family involvement and educational growth.\n\nGiven that over 20% of our town's population lives below the poverty line, the elementary school offers free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. The school's inclusive atmosphere treats every child and family with dignity, regardless of their financial situation. Costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are also reasonable, making education accessible to all.\n\nThe City Council and staff have made significant improvements to the town's appearance, including repaving roads, landscaping, and renovating city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have focused on the town's center and west side, where shopping areas and major traffic flow. The east side, where I reside, tends to be neglected, a point of contention for our community.\n\nDespite these issues, I genuinely appreciate living in this town. The residents are friendly, the schools excel, and we have a variety of shopping options to meet our needs. Our home may not be worth much, but it's comfortable and sufficient. After 16 years, our family cannot imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood has a rich cultural heritage, situated on a hill surrounded by buildings steeped in history. My apartment is in a 7-story building directly across from an old theater, and just a short walk away is a trendy arcade bar that attracts people of all walks of life on warm summer nights. The crowds flocking to it on weekends in June and July are a common sight. A short distance from there is a sizeable city park, with concrete surrounding its perimeter and tall stairs integrated into the wall. During harsh winter months, homeless individuals set up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and the wide steps, seeking shelter from the cold and rain. They prefer to congregate in the town center rather than in the outskirts, making it easier to stay warm and access nearby amenities like the family center where they can bathe and shower.\n\nWhat I love about my city isn't its historic architecture or the majestic buildings that dot the hills leading down to the ocean. It's the people themselves who bring the neighborhood to life. You see, Hilltop was notorious in the past for its gang violence, with stories of federal officials and the DEA attempting to clean up the streets decades ago still lingering in the air. The community hasn't forgotten, and these tales are passed down through generations, including to newcomers like me. Despite being considered one of the tougher neighborhoods in the city, residents work hard to keep it clean and look out for one another. They care deeply about their community and the issues that affect it.\n\nLocals often advise visitors not to walk around the Hill at night, a warning that I believe is rooted in the past and tainted by social biases. Perhaps I'm able to blend in because of my dark skin, or maybe the Hilltop community recognizes me as one of their own, someone who's acutely aware of the societal issues that plague our nation. These issues include racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions born out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that prides itself as a melting pot Utopia. One thing is certain: no matter where life takes me, Hilltop will always be home. I feel a sense of belonging walking those streets at night, meeting people who offer me a jacket or a helping hand rather than causing harm. It's a place where laundromat owners stay open late to let me charge my phone in the rain, and where strangers have offered me kindness and reassurance on the darkest of nights, making me feel seen and valued.",
            "I reside in Rural America, in a quaint small town in Michigan. The landscape shifts from rolling farmland to charming tourist cities, and you'll notice the absence of large shopping malls, retail giants like Walmart, Target, or even the likes of Applebee's. To get to any place, a drive is often the only option. Interestingly, amidst this rustic setting, my town is blessed with breathtaking natural beauty, surrounded by two majestic lakes: beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and the serene Lake Charlevoix on the other. Every direction you look, you'll find a picturesque beach perfect for dipping your toes. The neighborhood I call home embodies the essence of a small town. The houses are not cookie-cutter developments, but rather older, unique homes that reflect the character of the area. Some have been lovingly updated and remodeled, while others retain their original charm. Many of these homes boast spacious basements that are visible from the street, and the neighborhood is dotted with a kaleidoscope of colors, thanks to the diverse range of aluminum siding used on the houses. Yards are a common feature, complete with trampolines, playsets, and gardens, while some homes are fenced to keep pets safe. The atmosphere is quintessentially Midwestern, with hardworking families who value tradition and community. On any given day, you'll see kids playing in the streets, people walking their dogs, biking, or rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors, and you can easily spot those who fit in and those who don't. The sense of community is palpable, with friendly waves and warm smiles exchanged between residents. The lawns are well-maintained, with neatly trimmed grass and tidy gardens. It's not a neighborhood that screams \"look at me,\" but rather one that exudes a sense of warmth and welcoming familiarity. Our town is a haven, a place where families can feel safe and secure. Within walking distance, you'll find the county sheriff's department and jail, as well as the local health department and recycling center, which serve the community with dedication. The nearby baseball and softball fields are a hub of activity, with the sound of announcers calling out scores and player names filling the air. Our small-town airport is also nearby, adding to the area's charm. You can walk to get ice cream from the local parlor, or stroll downtown, which is just a short distance away. My kids can easily ride their bikes to the nearby park, which is just a few blocks away. This is a truly wonderful place to call home."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

They're not just found in malls, but also along the streets, which are often within walking distance of quiet neighborhoods. There are also a few parks nearby, and I've noticed that people take their little ones there often. As for the people, my neighborhood is really mixed - there's a big LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a bunch of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union all living in one small area. If you go a bit further out, there are even more people from all sorts of different backgrounds, but they're often grouped together in their own little communities within the city. We have places like Koreatown, Chinatown, and Little Armenia, all just a few miles away. However, driving that short distance can take a long time due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Nobody really walks much in my city, though - even though some cool spots are close by, the city is huge, and people don't like to walk.

            "At first glance, it's easy to overlook this place - it seems like a typical residential area behind a shopping strip, not really a neighborhood one would expect to find homes in. But if you walk behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and head towards the hotels that are only used for annual visits, aside from the occasional summer get-togethers, you'll stumble upon a thriving community. Among these communities are a series of apartment complexes, carefully arranged side by side like Russian nesting dolls that have been taken apart and placed in line along the road. \n\nWhile the apartments at the beginning of the row have gotten some bad press, we'll focus on the others. The ones next to those complexes, and the ones next to that, reveal a completely different world that's rarely known to locals. A community college's satellite campus is situated across from these complexes, its quiet, sleepy buildings standing guard beside the road. Students start their days with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning as they head to class. The entrance gates creak open one at a time, causing some morning commuters to groan in frustration.\n\nA residential road intersects with the main road, flanked by a park and a rehabilitation center for people with broken bones.

            "We were driving through an endless expanse of cornfields as she gazed out at the horizon in awe. \"Where are we?\" she asked, taken aback by the vast open space. I chuckled, knowing she'd be shocked by the stark contrast to her hometown where the grocery store was just a stone's throw away. I shared with her what it was like growing up in rural Ohio, where the cornfields stretched as far as the eye could see. In that moment, she finally got a glimpse of who I was and where I came from.\n\nAs we drove down the winding country road, the landscape gave way to a quarry filled with water, and then a small development that was home. The houses were a mix of brick and stucco, each one sprawling across at least half an acre of land that everyone took pride in keeping immaculate. In the spring, flowers bloomed alongside the midwestern trees that changed with the seasons, and the driveways were lined with sleek Mercedes-Benz luxury cars that glistened in the sunlight after a good wash.\n\nAs we turned onto my street, my neighbour, a friendly Korean man, was always outside, tending to his lawn with a song in his heart. He'd spend the entire day mowing, his voice blending in with the hum of his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Everyone in the neighbourhood loved him for his genuine nature and the unique stories he had to share. Though he'd lost some of his wit with age, he was still an amazing person who'd lived a life full of adventure as a doctor.\n\nMy home came into view, and in the side yard, geese waddled about, chased by our mischievous Terrier. Behind the house, a small stream flowed into the quarry, where the sounds of bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional \"moo\" from the nearby farms created a soothing melody. On the other side of the handmade wooden bridge lay a hidden oasis teeming with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. It was my childhood playground, where I spent my days building tree forts, \"hunting\" imaginary prey, and making friends with the kids from the neighbourhood. The winters were harsh, but there was something magical about it. The yard would transform from a lush green to a barren wilderness, and the trees that once bloomed with vibrant flowers would stand as skeletal sentinels of bark. And when snow fell, a winter wonderland would appear overnight, complete with snow angels and snowmen crafted by my little sister. We'd engage in fierce snowball fights, building massive forts to house our arsenal of branches. It was our own little world, where nothing else mattered, and we were just carefree kids.",
            "First off, to truly grasp the essence of Portland, Oregon, one must understand the meaning behind \"weird\". The phrase, which adorns a building that serves multiple purposes like a pizza joint, bar, music venue, and more, is an unofficial town slogan that goes by \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, it's a nostalgic call to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's - a time when the city was less known and less crowded, fostering unique and creative subcultures. To others, it's an invitation to visit a place where being called \"weird\" is considered a badge of honor.\n\nDespite the influx of affluent Californians and the rise of condominiums, Portland still maintains its offbeat charm. Being \"weird\" in Portland doesn't necessarily mean accepting anything, but rather embracing differences that are often shunned by society. We're not immune to modern conveniences and conflicts like the rest of the country, as we import most of our goods from China. However, there are countless ways to be \"weird\" or \"not normal\" in Portland, and we have our fair share of normalcy too. You'll find yoga enthusiasts, hipsters, and business professionals living alongside the rest of us.\n\nPerhaps what makes Portland truly \"weird\" is that we don't take ourselves too seriously. In my neighborhood, like many others, you'll spot colorful houses, vibrant home gardens, and free boxes lining the streets during the summer months. Free boxes typically contain items people are getting rid of, but they can be anything from clothes and books to unexpected treasures. The thrill of discovering something valuable in a free box is a big part of what makes Portland special, and it's a feeling that's unique to each neighborhood in the city.\n\nPortland has its quirkiness, and I'm just one example of the many weird and wonderful residents here. Some people I live among wouldn't dream of rummaging through boxes on the sidewalk, opting instead for activities like goat yoga or cheering on the city's soccer team at a Timbers match. What I love about Portland is its diversity - people here pursue their passions, whether it's starting a business, playing music, or simply enjoying a cold beer at the bar.\n\nOf course, like any city, Portland has its problems. We struggle with a drug issue that often stems from underlying mental health issues, and the constant rain doesn't help. We also have a homelessness problem that's a challenge to solve, with services that are insufficient but still better than in many other parts of the country. The non-homeless population is torn between feeling empathy and frustration towards the homeless. In this regard, Portland is not so \"weird\" after all.",
            "The mountains stand tall, a constant presence in the north, silently witnessing the passage of time as the sun rises and sets each day. Irrespective of how engrossed I am in work or life, they persist, unyielding to the ebbs and flows of life's turmoil. On days when I'm overwhelmed with stress and anxiety, they beckon me, and when I turn to them, they offer a respite, lending me the strength to carry on, one day at a time. It was during my undergraduate days that I first discovered their allure. While the university campus boasts its own share of breathtaking views, the mountains that lie to the north of the campus have an enduring hold on my heart. The university's charm, with its beautiful buildings, ponds, and trees, has won a part of my affection, but it's the mountains that hold the top spot. The rest of the town is equally captivating, with its array of quaint cafés where I spent countless hours fueled by caffeine and determination. A short walk or bus ride takes you to the downtown area, where the faded brick facades transport you to a bygone era, infusing the air with an aura of antiquity. Amidst this blend of suburban tranquility and urban vigor, the town presents a unique charm, an invitation to explore. The juxtaposition of these contrasting atmospheres within close proximity creates a captivating essence, as if beckoning me to uncover its secrets. With time, I've accumulated numerous cherished memories, each tied to a specific part of town, whether it's walking past the rusted swings in the park after a sleepless night with friends or racing through the bustling downtown to catch a movie that the university had provided tickets for. Alas, life has also bestowed upon me numerous harsh memories, a universal aspect of our experiences. The ponds, in particular, have come to serve as a poignant reminder of my introspective moments, as well as the many tears I've shed in the dead of night, grappling with existential crises. While watching the turtles, ducks, and insects live their lives, each with a role to play, I couldn't help but ponder my own purpose as I navigated the complexities of life. As I strolled past the pond, the park, and the quaint houses that epitomize suburban life, I eventually reached the main street, where the sun's rays danced across the palm trees, casting a kaleidoscope of colors across the sky. In that moment, as I gazed up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. And there they were – the mountains, steadfast and resolute, their presence speaking volumes, stirring within me a sense of resilience.",
            "Bensonhurst, Brooklyn - it's no secret that finding your way here is a breeze, thanks to the excellent public transportation system that's as accessible as it is convenient. As one of New York City's most popular forms of transportation, you'll find it easy to get around. With Bensonhurst being a bustling urban neighborhood, you'll still get that quintessential NYC vibe. During your visit, get ready to be surrounded by the numerous Asian stores that seem to be on every corner. It's no coincidence that this neighborhood has become a hub for Asian inhabitants over the past two decades, which is reflected in the abundance of Asian-owned stores. Supermarkets and laundromats are the most popular, and for good reason - they offer top-notch food, unbeatable prices, and unparalleled convenience. Just a stone's throw away from where I am, there are no less than four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walking distance from each other, making grocery shopping a total cinch.\n\nDon't get me wrong, Bensonhurst isn't a sea of Asian faces - it's a melting pot of cultures, with immigrants and their American-born children calling the neighborhood home. The majority of local businesses are still Asian-owned, though, and it's not uncommon to see families and friends of all ages enjoying the vibrant atmosphere. Just a short walk away, you'll find a newly renovated park that's a gem of the neighborhood. With ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for the summer months, there's something for everyone. As you'd expect in New York City, the park is a haven for diversity, and people of all ages and backgrounds come together to play and socialize.\n\nIn terms of housing, you won't find any large corporate buildings here - instead, co-op living and condominium apartments are the norm, with most residents calling two-family houses home. While the majority of people are friendly and welcoming, be prepared for some noise pollution. You'll often hear cars blasting their music, or people flooring it down the road, which can be a bit jarring. If you're visiting at night, it's a good idea to keep your wits about you - while Bensonhurst is generally a safe neighborhood, you never know when you might encounter someone looking for trouble. I've had my own run-ins with bullies and package thieves, but these incidents were a while back. Just remember to keep your shoes clean and be mindful of your surroundings!",
            "My home is nestled at the top of a steep hill, and I'm surrounded by a neighborhood with a unique landscape. People often call it the \"workout hill\" because joggers love to tackle the incline. Since there are no sidewalks, everyone walks on the road, which is a bit hazardous with its potholes and uneven surface. The street's lined with worn-out telephone and electric wires, which are frequently damaged by falling branches and debris from the many storms we get. Evergreen trees abound, but surprisingly, most people here dislike them, as they obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many houses are built high up on the hill, with large glass windows to take in the stunning view of the bay. Watching the sunset is breathtaking, with the water glowing from below and the sky turning orange. However, it's often cloudy, so the sunlight's filtered through a haze. The atmosphere's usually overcast and damp, which contributes to the lush growth of moss on everything – roofs, cars, and even railings. I once left my car in the driveway for a month, and when I returned, it was covered in a thick layer of moss that took me three hours to scrub off. Our neighborhood's relatively quiet, with only a few kids around, thanks to a school nearby. The majority of residents are retired folks, and instead of kids, we have plenty of dogs roaming around. It's not uncommon to see them lounging in people's lawns or racing down the street. If you leave a door or window open, they might sneak in, like when I once found one lounging in my living room and had to shoo it out. Rabbits are also abundant, and they love to dig up plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats have helped keep them under control, though. We also have a variety of birds, including small sparrows and hummingbirds, and occasionally, a hawk or eagle will swoop by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. While we don't have any stores nearby, a short hike down to the waterfront leads to a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. The beach itself isn't extensive, but the rocks along the shore make for fun skipping stones into the water. On most days, you can see the opposite shoreline clearly through the mist.",
            "I've been living in a typical suburban area in a small town in Tennessee for a while now. Our street is situated between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic than I'd like, but other than that, it's a pretty quiet neighborhood. We're not used to having many new faces around here, so I've gotten to know most of the regulars. Folks usually spend their time tending to their lawns and daily chores. In the winter, we enjoy sledding down the hill on our side street. Since we live in a house at the corner of our street, we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that roll through here. Whenever we spot a strange vehicle, we tend to take notice. Some of the neighbors like to take a stroll for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids are always out on their bikes, and you can hear the usual sounds of a small town. As we work from home, we're mostly at home, along with my wife and our two daughters, ages eleven and fourteen. So, it's no surprise that everyone else is used to seeing us come and go. We enjoy spending time outdoors, even when it's raining, and sometimes we fire up the grill on our back deck, filling the air with the delicious smell of barbecue. You can almost always hear the sound of lawn mowers from March to October, when the grass finally stops growing. Our neighborhood used to be wooded, so there are plenty of trees providing shade, but that also means raking and burning leaves every year in the Fall. I must admit, the smell of burning leaves is one of my favorites – it's a sure sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not had much of a Winter, so it feels like it's been one long Fall. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone knocks on the door, which is a rare occurrence. I like to tinker with my truck or other projects in the garage, and when the doors are open, it feels like I'm more connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, things are pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving and other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas bring some extra visitors, and you can spot more cars parked along the street. All in all, I'm quite happy living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "Yesterday, I found myself pondering about my neighborhood, situated smack dab in the middle of the high desert. The endless expanse of brown dirt stretches out before me, a constant reminder of the harsh yet beautiful environment I call home. Unless you've experienced living here firsthand, it's hard to comprehend the monotony of gazing out at the same dull landscape day in and day out. But when you do chance upon a well-manicured lawn, you know that person has invested a small fortune in lawn care. I've lived in this area since the 90s, and although the houses have sprouted up around me, the layout still feels largely the same. In fact, it's a bit eerie how much this place resembles a city, yet, like many other places, it's undergoing rapid transformation. The locals are generally friendly, but, just like any city, there's a mix of the good and the not-so-good. I'm surrounded by friendly elderly folks, which makes my neighborhood feel like a nicer community. The local stores are mostly chain stores, like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final, but if you're looking for upscale options, you're better off traveling elsewhere. I rarely see any Whole Foods or boutiques around here. The dominant industries in my city appear to be construction, given its relatively underdeveloped state and the abundance of open spaces waiting to be built upon. This thought unsettles me, as I prefer things the way they are now. I left behind a big city and don't fancy going back. My full-time job is in the construction field, specifically as a drywall and T-bar installer, which means I'm somewhat invested in its growth. What I appreciate about my home, however, is the unique wildlife. People flock to the high desert for its breathtaking beauty, and the challenging ecosystems it supports have created an opportunity for various species to thrive. It's essential for human residents to learn about and respect the non-human inhabitants of this environment to coexist peacefully. My family and I have adapted well to the wildlife, and my kids are particularly fascinated by lizards and desert bugs. As I write this, they're outside, trying to catch different specimens. As for attractions, we have a few gems. Victorville is a great destination for families looking to experience the desert, and if you plan your visit to coincide with the annual San Bernardino County Fair, you'll have a fantastic time. The fair offers an excellent mix of activities and fun, showcasing the Victorville way. If you're looking for a winter sports fix, head over to Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and take a lesson or two. Lastly, the Victor Valley Museum is a treasure trove of geological, paleontological, and Native American artifacts that provide valuable insights into the history and development of the high desert ecosystem.",
            "My neighborhood might sound like everyone else's, but trust me, it's unique. Unlike others who probably live in their own individual houses, I consider my neighborhood to be the campus I'm on and the people in my dormitory as my community. The surrounding campus is part of my neighborhood too, although it's not as central as the dorm. Despite being a bit unusual, my neighborhood shares some familiar traits with the typical idea of a neighborhood. Just like any normal neighborhood, it's got houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's dive into the 'houses' that make up my neighborhood. Before I do, I need to clarify the types of houses we have here. There are three kinds: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory houses. Apartments usually have 2-4 people in each room, with 4-6 rooms per floor, and about 20 people in each building. The actual houses are a bit rare, with 2-4 bedrooms, mostly occupied by alumni. Then there are the dorm rooms, where hundreds of students live, with each room housing 2 people, except in some cases. They're the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. Now, let's talk about the people. My school is proud of its diversity, and it shows in the neighborhood. You'll find people from all cultures and ages here. Professionals usually live in the houses, while new students are in dorms, and older students are in apartments. We can't do the people justice, so let's move on to the stores and park. Since my school is a mini-neighborhood, it has plenty of stores and a single park. The stores offer a mix of dining options and the school's unique brand of clothes and groceries. You can find anything you need within our neighborhood's boundaries. The park is our playground, kept clean and safe by everyone in the community.",
            "I've been living in this neighborhood for about 10 years now, so I guess it's time for me to share some stories about it. When I first moved here from Riverdale to Stockbridge, I was pretty sad because I missed my old home and the people I loved. My mom and dad made the tough decision to move us to a better neighborhood for a better life, a better school, and a safer environment. It wasn't easy, but I eventually got used to it and made some new friends, as well as some new enemies in school. To be honest, I never really got to know my neighbors that well, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and to a lesser extent, Dennis, who lived right next door. They've been like a family to me, and I feel grateful for having them in my life. I remember attending Mr. Glen's wedding, which was a great experience, and something I hope to replicate in my own life someday. When Ms. Veda threw off her prosthetic leg strap during the wedding, I managed to catch it, but unfortunately not the flowers. We danced the night away, and I had a blast with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I've lost touch with her since, but I hope she's doing well. The neighborhood can be confusing, but now that I have a GPS, I've been exploring it more. I've hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis a few times, and we used to spend hours playing video games and enjoying life. I also love visiting the park and appreciating nature, which helps me feel more calm and at peace. I often take sticks from Home Depot and practice my balance, and I enjoy wielding my bokken wooden sword. There are also a basketball and tennis court nearby, although I haven't played either sport in a while. My dad used to coach me and my best friend in tennis with Mr. Graves, and those were some of the best times. They pushed us hard, but we always had fun. Looking back, I've had a lot of fun in this neighborhood, and there are plenty of stories I could share, but these are the ones that stand out to me. I'm excited to see what the future holds.",
            "I'm really lucky to be living near the college I attend, and I think that's one of the best things about where I live. My neighborhood is pretty chill, with mostly apartment buildings and a few fun, affordable bars and restaurants to hang out at. One of the bars has just changed its name, but it's still not too pricey and the service and drinks are alright. Most of the people around here are either students or lower-income folks who can afford the apartments, which is pretty cool. You can hear the sound of kids playing since there's an elementary school nearby, within walking distance of my place. To be honest, I don't really know my neighbors - they're a bit too into smoking weed, and the management installed an air freshener unit right outside their door, which my boyfriend and I thought was pretty funny. It's almost like they're trying to send a message. The buildings around me are a bit old-fashioned, but they might have been renovated on the inside. Down the street, there are brand new apartments, but I'm not a fan - they're super cheaply built but the rent is way too high, which I think is just taking advantage of people. Since they're close to campus, though, the management gets away with it. There's this one super cheap eatery about a 5-minute walk from my place that only serves food on paper plates and most of their dishes are microwaved. Across from that is a gas station that's not exactly the best place to work. But thanks to some city funding, they redid the road last summer, so now we have a nice big sidewalk, some grass on the median and the sides, and the area looks a lot nicer. The apartment building I live in has a lot of trees around it, but they cut some down, so now there are a few stumps left. There are way more trees where I live than down the street. Behind my apartment complex is a line of trees and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street, which isn't as nice. The sidewalks are in bad shape and the buildings look pretty shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but I think they're just trying to hide the state of the buildings. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but I don't blame them entirely - there are other apartments across the street with their own problems and a pretty transient population. Despite all this, I really like where I live. It's affordable, and there are plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially love that the university is within walking distance, and there are two bus stops so I can easily get to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood is a haven of colorful duplexes nestled in a cul-de-sac. The houses are spread out in a way that makes them seem like individual homes, with only one notable difference - each one is painted a cheerful yellow, adorned with white porches and green metal roofs. While not everyone is close friends, there's a sense of camaraderie that permeates the air. On some evenings, you'll find us gathered at the end of a driveway, chatting and laughing as the kids play with their toys, sidewalk chalk, or fly their kites. It's a refreshing escape from the hustle and bustle of the modern world, a step back in time when life was simpler. The surrounding fields and trees are a stunning backdrop, set against a brilliant blue sky with puffy white clouds. However, this season has brought a new challenge - tornado warnings, which recently culminated in our first-ever experience of actual sirens blaring, prompting us to seek shelter. I was huddled in my bathtub with my smallest dog and some essentials, while my bigger dog stayed put in the living room, anxious and barking. The neighborhood was eerily quiet, except for the sound of large hail pounding the ground. After the storm, the temperature dropped dramatically, and the road was suddenly steaming hot. The hail melted instantly on the pavement as the sun broke through the clearing skies and a double rainbow appeared. I dashed inside to grab my camera and snapped some pictures to share with my friends and family on Facebook - they were as amazed as I was. It took about an hour for the streets to return to normal, and soon the familiar sounds of mom's cooking and children's laughter filled the air. I've grown to love this friendly community, especially the warm Southern accents that fill the air. My two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment is just like everyone else's on the outside, but each one has its unique character on the inside. It's puzzling why some apartments are so small, but it's a minor quirk in an otherwise idyllic setting. I adore strolling through the vast field behind my home, meandering down to the pond that's not meant for swimming. I've spotted deer and even heard the majestic bullfrog's morning serenade. It's a fantastic place to live, just a 40-minute drive from the city of Charlotte. Every morning begins with the cheerful sound of roosters crowing from the nearby farms, creating a sense of community that's hard to find in the city. We even have a friendly donkey at a nearby farm that brays in the evening, reminding us of its presence. I feel lucky to have discovered this hidden gem of a neighborhood.",
            "I stepped into my new neighborhood just as I was about to enter the world of eighth grade. At first, it was tough to connect with the locals, but fate had other plans, and I formed a bond with a guy living right next door and another fellow on my street. Although they're no longer around, the memories remain vivid. The people who were here when I first arrived are still here, giving our neighborhood a sense of continuity. Our neighborhood is just like any other American suburban neighborhood, with rows of two-story houses lining the streets. You can hear the sound of kids playing outside on weekends or whenever the sun is out, and the neighborhood is generally quiet on most weekdays. I've never had any issues with my neighbors, and I feel like I can trust them completely. When I order packages online, they always arrive safely on my porch. Our neighborhood is the kind of place where you're left alone unless you need help.\n\nJust a minute or two away from my house is a park that holds a special place in my heart. I've spent countless hours playing basketball, football, and baseball there with the guys from the neighborhood. One of my not-so-fond memories also happened there when I got elbowed in the nose during a football game, but the good times far outweigh the bad. Nowadays, I visit the park with my cousin's kids, who are a lot younger and still enjoy the simple joys of swings and slides. Just thinking about heading to the park gets them excited. The park is now a source of nostalgia for me, reminding me of the good old days.\n\nOur neighborhood is a melting pot of cultures, with a wide variety of food options nearby. Within a one-mile radius, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, with the rise of food delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash, many people prefer to have their meals delivered to their doorstep. The most popular food places are the fast food chains, but you can find those in many suburban neighborhoods. There are also plenty of pizza places to choose from. Our stores have everything you need, with multiple dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store on the same street. Some stores even cater to different tastes, like an Indian-owned store for those who want to cook up some homemade Indian dishes or buy pre-made meals.\n\nI'm grateful for my neighborhood, especially after reading about the horror stories of people dealing with difficult neighbors on social media. It's a blessing to have a community like mine.",
            "My hometown is a quaint little place in South Carolina, blending seamlessly into the rest of the landscape. It's not particularly famous, but it's made its mark in the agricultural sector, thanks to its status as the Peach Capital of the World, proudly displayed on the town's welcoming sign. The town is primarily composed of vast farmlands dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses on the outskirts of town are spaced far apart, mostly two-story structures with metal roofs to shield them from the scorching summer heat or gray shingles. Most homes are nestled away from the main road, allowing the front fields to be used for raising animals or growing crops. Downtown, the town's single traffic light hangs at a four-way intersection, marking the spot where the local stores are concentrated. There are a few eateries where you can grab fast food: Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a local family; Fiesta Mexican Restaurant; or Gary's, a small burger chain. A pizzeria once called the town home, but it closed its doors a while back. The Maxwell and Halford Drug pharmacy is a family-owned business, and it's famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola; not many people know that, though. IGA, a small, pricey grocery store, is the only one in town, but many residents prefer to shop at a Walmart in the nearby Batesburg-Leesville for most of their grocery needs. Dollar General, however, is the most popular spot in town, offering a wide range of everyday items and bustling with activity from opening to closing. Possibilities Furniture & More, a quaint furniture store run by a well-respected woman in the community, has been a part of the town for years and even employs two movers to deliver purchased furniture. Next door, Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a small pet groomer, offers various services, including daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and more. The town has two small medical practices, one for humans and one for animals, located outside the main part of town. Johnston Elementary School is the town's only elementary school, and students usually move on to middle and high school in the next town over after completing fifth grade. Although there aren't any parks in town, the local government is in the process of creating a 2.5-acre recreational area to provide families with more opportunities to spend time together and attract new residents. It's a quiet town, with limited entertainment options – no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or \"hangout\" spots, but it's a nice place, so small it's easy to miss while driving by.",
            "I first heard about my neighborhood through a podcast featuring people who'd gone missing in the area. It was quite surprising to hear. Almost every apartment in the place was renting for over a thousand dollars a month – something none of my friends and I had ever heard about. I guess that's what happens when you're struggling. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night due to financial burdens. We've learned to be frugal over the years, though. You start to appreciate the dusty smell of second-hand toys and mothballed clothes. As you grow older, you come to notice you smell less as well. Some people might start smoking, while others just get accustomed to the state of things. However, the flea market always finds a way to assert itself. The smell of adulthood is that of dusty magazines piled on a closed piano, which even persists after you wash it. In my area, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start from the far side, you can visit two charity thrift stores, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling with cars and people every morning, but you'd never hear the noise in the thrift stores. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the stores remain quiet. It's a great place to lose an afternoon. Every year, the downtown area gets more crowded with cars and people. It's a growing city, they say. One of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery is based here, and it's still showing signs of growth pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is focused on their own goals, and people generally don't pry into one another's lives. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. This is different from the South, where being a little concerned means showing you care. Here, people respect your personal space and won't intrude unless you invite them to. It's a lively and welcoming place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment full of strangers and more of a community of friends who come together for our needs, celebrate our birthdays, mourn our losses, and help each other when we can. I'm fortunate to live here. I quite like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I try to clean up after myself and leave food for them, and they do the same for me. I bring their mail and they bring mine. It's nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. Despite living in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl, it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I haven't completely messed up my life.",
            "I live in a typical suburban area that looks like it's been cut out from a cookie cutter. You can't help but notice the presence of a homeowner's association when you first enter the neighborhood. The streets are filled with well-maintained single-family homes, all thanks to the HOA's hard work. The front yards are almost identical, with a small patch of grass, some decorative pebbles, and short driveways. You'll occasionally spot small trees and two-car garages. As you drive through the neighborhood, you'll notice newly paved concrete roads with no potholes in sight. Most houses are single-story, but some have two stories. One thing that stands out is the mailbox system – instead of individual mailboxes in front of each house, there's a large group of mailboxes at the end of the street, and you need a key to access your specific one. There are also two larger lockers for packages. The HOA's love for uniformity is really evident here. My house is located on the outskirts of the nearby city, so my neighborhood feels like a mix of rural and suburban areas. As a result, we have plenty of space for everything – there are multiple community pools that are well-maintained and gated, as well as walking trails where you can take your dog or go for a solo evening stroll. You don't even need to go to a park to get some exercise; just take a run around the neighborhood and you'll get enough. The community is mostly made up of retired people, but we also have a few middle-aged and young professionals living here. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for each other. We have a small town feel despite being part of a larger city, and we have most of the amenities you'd expect – except for one mall, which is surprisingly sufficient. It takes around 15 minutes to drive to anywhere significant, but once you get there, you have access to a variety of stores, from high-end grocery stores to bargain outlets. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty standard – we have our perks, like pools and walking trails, but we're not exactly next door to a shopping district, so you just hop in the car and head to any major chain store you want.",
            "Living in a small Midwestern town just outside the city's suburbs has its unique charm. Our neighborhood on the town's east side, where I reside, is often regarded as the most economically disadvantaged area. Property values are low, with many homes rented or owned by low-income families, yet this doesn't define the community's character. The friendly neighbors I've encountered smile and greet me as I walk down the street, giving our area a welcoming atmosphere.\n\nWhile crime rates are slightly higher than in other parts of town, they remain relatively low. Unfortunately, there have been a few violent incidents nearby, including shootings and a homicide, which shook our community. Our next-door neighbors suffered a personal loss when their son was killed outside a local bar. Fortunately, our family has been spared from direct harm, apart from occasional incidents of theft when we forget to bring items inside.\n\nThe town as a whole has been heavily impacted by the opioid epidemic, which has ravaged many parts of the United States. The loss of lives due to fentanyl overdoses has been devastating. Thankfully, our town has made efforts to combat this crisis through addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected.\n\nDespite these challenges, our town has many redeeming qualities. My son's elementary school boasts an exceptional staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff, creating a positive and supportive environment. His special needs haven't hindered his experience, and he loves attending school. The active Parent-Teacher Organization (PTO) organizes numerous events to foster family involvement and educational growth.\n\nGiven that over 20% of our town's population lives below the poverty line, the elementary school offers free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. The school's inclusive atmosphere treats every child and family with dignity, regardless of their financial situation. Costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are also reasonable, making education accessible to all.\n\nThe City Council and staff have made significant improvements to the town's appearance, including repaving roads, landscaping, and renovating city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have focused on the town's center and west side, where shopping areas and major traffic flow. The east side, where I reside, tends to be neglected, a point of contention for our community.\n\nDespite these issues, I genuinely appreciate living in this town. The residents are friendly, the schools excel, and we have a variety of shopping options to meet our needs. Our home may not be worth much, but it's comfortable and sufficient. After 16 years, our family cannot imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood has a rich cultural heritage, situated on a hill surrounded by buildings steeped in history. My apartment is in a 7-story building directly across from an old theater, and just a short walk away is a trendy arcade bar that attracts people of all walks of life on warm summer nights. The crowds flocking to it on weekends in June and July are a common sight. A short distance from there is a sizeable city park, with concrete surrounding its perimeter and tall stairs integrated into the wall. During harsh winter months, homeless individuals set up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and the wide steps, seeking shelter from the cold and rain. They prefer to congregate in the town center rather than in the outskirts, making it easier to stay warm and access nearby amenities like the family center where they can bathe and shower.\n\nWhat I love about my city isn't its historic architecture or the majestic buildings that dot the hills leading down to the ocean. It's the people themselves who bring the neighborhood to life. You see, Hilltop was notorious in the past for its gang violence, with stories of federal officials and the DEA attempting to clean up the streets decades ago still lingering in the air. The community hasn't forgotten, and these tales are passed down through generations, including to newcomers like me. Despite being considered one of the tougher neighborhoods in the city, residents work hard to keep it clean and look out for one another. They care deeply about their community and the issues that affect it.\n\nLocals often advise visitors not to walk around the Hill at night, a warning that I believe is rooted in the past and tainted by social biases. Perhaps I'm able to blend in because of my dark skin, or maybe the Hilltop community recognizes me as one of their own, someone who's acutely aware of the societal issues that plague our nation. These issues include racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions born out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that prides itself as a melting pot Utopia. One thing is certain: no matter where life takes me, Hilltop will always be home. I feel a sense of belonging walking those streets at night, meeting people who offer me a jacket or a helping hand rather than causing harm. It's a place where laundromat owners stay open late to let me charge my phone in the rain, and where strangers have offered me kindness and reassurance on the darkest of nights, making me feel seen and valued.",
            "I reside in Rural America, in a quaint small town in Michigan. The landscape shifts from rolling farmland to charming tourist cities, and you'll notice the absence of large shopping malls, retail giants like Walmart, Target, or even the likes of Applebee's. To get to any place, a drive is often the only option. Interestingly, amidst this rustic setting, my town is blessed with breathtaking natural beauty, surrounded by two majestic lakes: beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and the serene Lake Charlevoix on the other. Every direction you look, you'll find a picturesque beach perfect for dipping your toes. The neighborhood I call home embodies the essence of a small town. The houses are not cookie-cutter developments, but rather older, unique homes that reflect the character of the area. Some have been lovingly updated and remodeled, while others retain their original charm. Many of these homes boast spacious basements that are visible from the street, and the neighborhood is dotted with a kaleidoscope of colors, thanks to the diverse range of aluminum siding used on the houses. Yards are a common feature, complete with trampolines, playsets, and gardens, while some homes are fenced to keep pets safe. The atmosphere is quintessentially Midwestern, with hardworking families who value tradition and community. On any given day, you'll see kids playing in the streets, people walking their dogs, biking, or rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors, and you can easily spot those who fit in and those who don't. The sense of community is palpable, with friendly waves and warm smiles exchanged between residents. The lawns are well-maintained, with neatly trimmed grass and tidy gardens. It's not a neighborhood that screams \"look at me,\" but rather one that exudes a sense of warmth and welcoming familiarity. Our town is a haven, a place where families can feel safe and secure. Within walking distance, you'll find the county sheriff's department and jail, as well as the local health department and recycling center, which serve the community with dedication. The nearby baseball and softball fields are a hub of activity, with the sound of announcers calling out scores and player names filling the air. Our small-town airport is also nearby, adding to the area's charm. You can walk to get ice cream from the local parlor, or stroll downtown, which is just a short distance away. My kids can easily ride their bikes to the nearby park, which is just a few blocks away. This is a truly wonderful place to call home."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "We were driving through an endless expanse of cornfields as she gazed out at the horizon in awe. \"Where are we?\" she asked, taken aback by the vast open space. I chuckled, knowing she'd be shocked by the stark contrast to her hometown where the grocery store was just a stone's throw away.

In the spring, flowers bloomed alongside the midwestern trees that changed with the seasons, and the driveways were lined with sleek Mercedes-Benz luxury cars that glistened in the sunlight after a good wash.\n\nAs we turned onto my street, my neighbour, a friendly Korean man, was always outside, tending to his lawn with a song in his heart. He'd spend the entire day mowing, his voice blending in with the hum of his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Everyone in the neighbourhood loved him for his genuine nature and the unique stories he had to share. Though he'd lost some of his wit with age, he was still an amazing person who'd lived a life full of adventure as a doctor.\n\nMy home came into view, and in the side yard, geese waddled about, chased by our mischievous Terrier. Behind the house, a small stream flowed into the quarry, where the sounds of bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional \"moo\" from the nearby farms created a soothing melody. On the other side of the handmade wooden bridge lay a hidden oasis teeming with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. It was my childhood playground, where I spent my days building tree forts, \"hunting\" imaginary prey, and making friends with the kids from the neighbourhood. The winters were harsh, but there was something magical about it. The yard would transform from a lush green to a barren wilderness, and the trees that once bloomed with vibrant flowers would stand as skeletal sentinels of bark. And when snow fell, a winter wonderland would appear overnight, complete with snow angels and snowmen crafted by my little sister. We'd engage in fierce snowball fights, building massive forts to house our arsenal of branches. It was our own little world, where nothing else mattered, and we were just carefree kids.",
            "First off, to truly grasp the essence of Portland, Oregon, one must understand the meaning behind \"weird\". The phrase, which adorns a building that serves multiple purposes like a pizza joint, bar, music venue, and more, is an unofficial town slogan that goes by \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, it's a nostalgic call to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's - a time when the city was less known and less crowded, fostering unique and creative subcultures. To others, it's an invitation to visit a place where being called \"weird\" is considered a badge of honor.\n\nDespite the influx of affluent Californians and the rise of condominiums, Portland still maintains its offbeat charm. Being \"weird\" in Portland doesn't necessarily mean accepting anything, but rather embracing differences that are often shunned by society. We're not immune to modern conveniences and conflicts like the rest of the country, as we import most of our goods from China. However, there are countless ways to be \"weird\" or \"not normal\" in Portland, and we have our fair share of normalcy too. You'll find yoga enthusiasts, hipsters, and business professionals living alongside the rest of us.\n\nPerhaps what makes Portland truly \"weird\" is that we don't take ourselves too seriously. In my neighborhood, like many others, you'll spot colorful houses, vibrant home gardens, and free boxes lining the streets during the summer months. Free boxes typically contain items people are getting rid of, but they can be anything from clothes and books to unexpected treasures. The thrill of discovering something valuable in a free box is a big part of what makes Portland special, and it's a feeling that's unique to each neighborhood in the city.\n\nPortland has its quirkiness, and I'm just one example of the many weird and wonderful residents here. Some people I live among wouldn't dream of rummaging through boxes on the sidewalk, opting instead for activities like goat yoga or cheering on the city's soccer team at a Timbers match. What I love about Portland is its diversity - people here pursue their passions, whether it's starting a business, playing music, or simply enjoying a cold beer at the bar.\n\nOf course, like any city, Portland has its problems. We struggle with a drug issue that often stems from underlying mental health issues, and the constant rain doesn't help. We also have a homelessness problem that's a challenge to solve, with services that are insufficient but still better than in many other parts of the country. The non-homeless population is torn between feeling empathy and frustration towards the homeless. In this regard, Portland is not so \"weird\" after all.",
            "The mountains stand tall, a constant presence in the north, silently witnessing the passage of time as the sun rises and sets each day. Irrespective of how engrossed I am in work or life, they persist, unyielding to the ebbs and flows of life's turmoil. On days when I'm overwhelmed with stress and anxiety, they beckon me, and when I turn to them, they offer a respite, lending me the strength to carry on, one day at a time. It was during my undergraduate days that I first discovered their allure. While the university campus boasts its own share of breathtaking views, the mountains that lie to the north of the campus have an enduring hold on my heart. The university's charm, with its beautiful buildings, ponds, and trees, has won a part of my affection, but it's the mountains that hold the top spot. The rest of the town is equally captivating, with its array of quaint cafés where I spent countless hours fueled by caffeine and determination. A short walk or bus ride takes you to the downtown area, where the faded brick facades transport you to a bygone era, infusing the air with an aura of antiquity. Amidst this blend of suburban tranquility and urban vigor, the town presents a unique charm, an invitation to explore. The juxtaposition of these contrasting atmospheres within close proximity creates a captivating essence, as if beckoning me to uncover its secrets. With time, I've accumulated numerous cherished memories, each tied to a specific part of town, whether it's walking past the rusted swings in the park after a sleepless night with friends or racing through the bustling downtown to catch a movie that the university had provided tickets for. Alas, life has also bestowed upon me numerous harsh memories, a universal aspect of our experiences. The ponds, in particular, have come to serve as a poignant reminder of my introspective moments, as well as the many tears I've shed in the dead of night, grappling with existential crises. While watching the turtles, ducks, and insects live their lives, each with a role to play, I couldn't help but ponder my own purpose as I navigated the complexities of life. As I strolled past the pond, the park, and the quaint houses that epitomize suburban life, I eventually reached the main street, where the sun's rays danced across the palm trees, casting a kaleidoscope of colors across the sky. In that moment, as I gazed up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. And there they were – the mountains, steadfast and resolute, their presence speaking volumes, stirring within me a sense of resilience.",
            "Bensonhurst, Brooklyn - it's no secret that finding your way here is a breeze, thanks to the excellent public transportation system that's as accessible as it is convenient. As one of New York City's most popular forms of transportation, you'll find it easy to get around. With Bensonhurst being a bustling urban neighborhood, you'll still get that quintessential NYC vibe. During your visit, get ready to be surrounded by the numerous Asian stores that seem to be on every corner. It's no coincidence that this neighborhood has become a hub for Asian inhabitants over the past two decades, which is reflected in the abundance of Asian-owned stores. Supermarkets and laundromats are the most popular, and for good reason - they offer top-notch food, unbeatable prices, and unparalleled convenience. Just a stone's throw away from where I am, there are no less than four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walking distance from each other, making grocery shopping a total cinch.\n\nDon't get me wrong, Bensonhurst isn't a sea of Asian faces - it's a melting pot of cultures, with immigrants and their American-born children calling the neighborhood home. The majority of local businesses are still Asian-owned, though, and it's not uncommon to see families and friends of all ages enjoying the vibrant atmosphere. Just a short walk away, you'll find a newly renovated park that's a gem of the neighborhood. With ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for the summer months, there's something for everyone. As you'd expect in New York City, the park is a haven for diversity, and people of all ages and backgrounds come together to play and socialize.\n\nIn terms of housing, you won't find any large corporate buildings here - instead, co-op living and condominium apartments are the norm, with most residents calling two-family houses home. While the majority of people are friendly and welcoming, be prepared for some noise pollution. You'll often hear cars blasting their music, or people flooring it down the road, which can be a bit jarring. If you're visiting at night, it's a good idea to keep your wits about you - while Bensonhurst is generally a safe neighborhood, you never know when you might encounter someone looking for trouble. I've had my own run-ins with bullies and package thieves, but these incidents were a while back. Just remember to keep your shoes clean and be mindful of your surroundings!",
            "My home is nestled at the top of a steep hill, and I'm surrounded by a neighborhood with a unique landscape. People often call it the \"workout hill\" because joggers love to tackle the incline. Since there are no sidewalks, everyone walks on the road, which is a bit hazardous with its potholes and uneven surface. The street's lined with worn-out telephone and electric wires, which are frequently damaged by falling branches and debris from the many storms we get. Evergreen trees abound, but surprisingly, most people here dislike them, as they obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many houses are built high up on the hill, with large glass windows to take in the stunning view of the bay. Watching the sunset is breathtaking, with the water glowing from below and the sky turning orange. However, it's often cloudy, so the sunlight's filtered through a haze. The atmosphere's usually overcast and damp, which contributes to the lush growth of moss on everything – roofs, cars, and even railings. I once left my car in the driveway for a month, and when I returned, it was covered in a thick layer of moss that took me three hours to scrub off. Our neighborhood's relatively quiet, with only a few kids around, thanks to a school nearby. The majority of residents are retired folks, and instead of kids, we have plenty of dogs roaming around. It's not uncommon to see them lounging in people's lawns or racing down the street. If you leave a door or window open, they might sneak in, like when I once found one lounging in my living room and had to shoo it out. Rabbits are also abundant, and they love to dig up plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats have helped keep them under control, though. We also have a variety of birds, including small sparrows and hummingbirds, and occasionally, a hawk or eagle will swoop by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. While we don't have any stores nearby, a short hike down to the waterfront leads to a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. The beach itself isn't extensive, but the rocks along the shore make for fun skipping stones into the water. On most days, you can see the opposite shoreline clearly through the mist.",
            "I've been living in a typical suburban area in a small town in Tennessee for a while now. Our street is situated between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic than I'd like, but other than that, it's a pretty quiet neighborhood. We're not used to having many new faces around here, so I've gotten to know most of the regulars. Folks usually spend their time tending to their lawns and daily chores. In the winter, we enjoy sledding down the hill on our side street. Since we live in a house at the corner of our street, we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that roll through here. Whenever we spot a strange vehicle, we tend to take notice. Some of the neighbors like to take a stroll for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids are always out on their bikes, and you can hear the usual sounds of a small town. As we work from home, we're mostly at home, along with my wife and our two daughters, ages eleven and fourteen. So, it's no surprise that everyone else is used to seeing us come and go. We enjoy spending time outdoors, even when it's raining, and sometimes we fire up the grill on our back deck, filling the air with the delicious smell of barbecue. You can almost always hear the sound of lawn mowers from March to October, when the grass finally stops growing. Our neighborhood used to be wooded, so there are plenty of trees providing shade, but that also means raking and burning leaves every year in the Fall. I must admit, the smell of burning leaves is one of my favorites – it's a sure sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not had much of a Winter, so it feels like it's been one long Fall. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone knocks on the door, which is a rare occurrence. I like to tinker with my truck or other projects in the garage, and when the doors are open, it feels like I'm more connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, things are pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving and other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas bring some extra visitors, and you can spot more cars parked along the street. All in all, I'm quite happy living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "Yesterday, I found myself pondering about my neighborhood, situated smack dab in the middle of the high desert. The endless expanse of brown dirt stretches out before me, a constant reminder of the harsh yet beautiful environment I call home. Unless you've experienced living here firsthand, it's hard to comprehend the monotony of gazing out at the same dull landscape day in and day out. But when you do chance upon a well-manicured lawn, you know that person has invested a small fortune in lawn care. I've lived in this area since the 90s, and although the houses have sprouted up around me, the layout still feels largely the same. In fact, it's a bit eerie how much this place resembles a city, yet, like many other places, it's undergoing rapid transformation. The locals are generally friendly, but, just like any city, there's a mix of the good and the not-so-good. I'm surrounded by friendly elderly folks, which makes my neighborhood feel like a nicer community. The local stores are mostly chain stores, like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final, but if you're looking for upscale options, you're better off traveling elsewhere. I rarely see any Whole Foods or boutiques around here. The dominant industries in my city appear to be construction, given its relatively underdeveloped state and the abundance of open spaces waiting to be built upon. This thought unsettles me, as I prefer things the way they are now. I left behind a big city and don't fancy going back. My full-time job is in the construction field, specifically as a drywall and T-bar installer, which means I'm somewhat invested in its growth. What I appreciate about my home, however, is the unique wildlife. People flock to the high desert for its breathtaking beauty, and the challenging ecosystems it supports have created an opportunity for various species to thrive. It's essential for human residents to learn about and respect the non-human inhabitants of this environment to coexist peacefully. My family and I have adapted well to the wildlife, and my kids are particularly fascinated by lizards and desert bugs. As I write this, they're outside, trying to catch different specimens. As for attractions, we have a few gems. Victorville is a great destination for families looking to experience the desert, and if you plan your visit to coincide with the annual San Bernardino County Fair, you'll have a fantastic time. The fair offers an excellent mix of activities and fun, showcasing the Victorville way. If you're looking for a winter sports fix, head over to Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and take a lesson or two. Lastly, the Victor Valley Museum is a treasure trove of geological, paleontological, and Native American artifacts that provide valuable insights into the history and development of the high desert ecosystem.",
            "My neighborhood might sound like everyone else's, but trust me, it's unique. Unlike others who probably live in their own individual houses, I consider my neighborhood to be the campus I'm on and the people in my dormitory as my community. The surrounding campus is part of my neighborhood too, although it's not as central as the dorm. Despite being a bit unusual, my neighborhood shares some familiar traits with the typical idea of a neighborhood. Just like any normal neighborhood, it's got houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's dive into the 'houses' that make up my neighborhood. Before I do, I need to clarify the types of houses we have here. There are three kinds: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory houses. Apartments usually have 2-4 people in each room, with 4-6 rooms per floor, and about 20 people in each building. The actual houses are a bit rare, with 2-4 bedrooms, mostly occupied by alumni. Then there are the dorm rooms, where hundreds of students live, with each room housing 2 people, except in some cases. They're the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. Now, let's talk about the people. My school is proud of its diversity, and it shows in the neighborhood. You'll find people from all cultures and ages here. Professionals usually live in the houses, while new students are in dorms, and older students are in apartments. We can't do the people justice, so let's move on to the stores and park. Since my school is a mini-neighborhood, it has plenty of stores and a single park. The stores offer a mix of dining options and the school's unique brand of clothes and groceries. You can find anything you need within our neighborhood's boundaries. The park is our playground, kept clean and safe by everyone in the community.",
            "I've been living in this neighborhood for about 10 years now, so I guess it's time for me to share some stories about it. When I first moved here from Riverdale to Stockbridge, I was pretty sad because I missed my old home and the people I loved. My mom and dad made the tough decision to move us to a better neighborhood for a better life, a better school, and a safer environment. It wasn't easy, but I eventually got used to it and made some new friends, as well as some new enemies in school. To be honest, I never really got to know my neighbors that well, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and to a lesser extent, Dennis, who lived right next door. They've been like a family to me, and I feel grateful for having them in my life. I remember attending Mr. Glen's wedding, which was a great experience, and something I hope to replicate in my own life someday. When Ms. Veda threw off her prosthetic leg strap during the wedding, I managed to catch it, but unfortunately not the flowers. We danced the night away, and I had a blast with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I've lost touch with her since, but I hope she's doing well. The neighborhood can be confusing, but now that I have a GPS, I've been exploring it more. I've hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis a few times, and we used to spend hours playing video games and enjoying life. I also love visiting the park and appreciating nature, which helps me feel more calm and at peace. I often take sticks from Home Depot and practice my balance, and I enjoy wielding my bokken wooden sword. There are also a basketball and tennis court nearby, although I haven't played either sport in a while. My dad used to coach me and my best friend in tennis with Mr. Graves, and those were some of the best times. They pushed us hard, but we always had fun. Looking back, I've had a lot of fun in this neighborhood, and there are plenty of stories I could share, but these are the ones that stand out to me. I'm excited to see what the future holds.",
            "I'm really lucky to be living near the college I attend, and I think that's one of the best things about where I live. My neighborhood is pretty chill, with mostly apartment buildings and a few fun, affordable bars and restaurants to hang out at. One of the bars has just changed its name, but it's still not too pricey and the service and drinks are alright. Most of the people around here are either students or lower-income folks who can afford the apartments, which is pretty cool. You can hear the sound of kids playing since there's an elementary school nearby, within walking distance of my place. To be honest, I don't really know my neighbors - they're a bit too into smoking weed, and the management installed an air freshener unit right outside their door, which my boyfriend and I thought was pretty funny. It's almost like they're trying to send a message. The buildings around me are a bit old-fashioned, but they might have been renovated on the inside. Down the street, there are brand new apartments, but I'm not a fan - they're super cheaply built but the rent is way too high, which I think is just taking advantage of people. Since they're close to campus, though, the management gets away with it. There's this one super cheap eatery about a 5-minute walk from my place that only serves food on paper plates and most of their dishes are microwaved. Across from that is a gas station that's not exactly the best place to work. But thanks to some city funding, they redid the road last summer, so now we have a nice big sidewalk, some grass on the median and the sides, and the area looks a lot nicer. The apartment building I live in has a lot of trees around it, but they cut some down, so now there are a few stumps left. There are way more trees where I live than down the street. Behind my apartment complex is a line of trees and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street, which isn't as nice. The sidewalks are in bad shape and the buildings look pretty shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but I think they're just trying to hide the state of the buildings. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but I don't blame them entirely - there are other apartments across the street with their own problems and a pretty transient population. Despite all this, I really like where I live. It's affordable, and there are plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially love that the university is within walking distance, and there are two bus stops so I can easily get to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood is a haven of colorful duplexes nestled in a cul-de-sac. The houses are spread out in a way that makes them seem like individual homes, with only one notable difference - each one is painted a cheerful yellow, adorned with white porches and green metal roofs. While not everyone is close friends, there's a sense of camaraderie that permeates the air. On some evenings, you'll find us gathered at the end of a driveway, chatting and laughing as the kids play with their toys, sidewalk chalk, or fly their kites. It's a refreshing escape from the hustle and bustle of the modern world, a step back in time when life was simpler. The surrounding fields and trees are a stunning backdrop, set against a brilliant blue sky with puffy white clouds. However, this season has brought a new challenge - tornado warnings, which recently culminated in our first-ever experience of actual sirens blaring, prompting us to seek shelter. I was huddled in my bathtub with my smallest dog and some essentials, while my bigger dog stayed put in the living room, anxious and barking. The neighborhood was eerily quiet, except for the sound of large hail pounding the ground. After the storm, the temperature dropped dramatically, and the road was suddenly steaming hot. The hail melted instantly on the pavement as the sun broke through the clearing skies and a double rainbow appeared. I dashed inside to grab my camera and snapped some pictures to share with my friends and family on Facebook - they were as amazed as I was. It took about an hour for the streets to return to normal, and soon the familiar sounds of mom's cooking and children's laughter filled the air. I've grown to love this friendly community, especially the warm Southern accents that fill the air. My two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment is just like everyone else's on the outside, but each one has its unique character on the inside. It's puzzling why some apartments are so small, but it's a minor quirk in an otherwise idyllic setting. I adore strolling through the vast field behind my home, meandering down to the pond that's not meant for swimming. I've spotted deer and even heard the majestic bullfrog's morning serenade. It's a fantastic place to live, just a 40-minute drive from the city of Charlotte. Every morning begins with the cheerful sound of roosters crowing from the nearby farms, creating a sense of community that's hard to find in the city. We even have a friendly donkey at a nearby farm that brays in the evening, reminding us of its presence. I feel lucky to have discovered this hidden gem of a neighborhood.",
            "I stepped into my new neighborhood just as I was about to enter the world of eighth grade. At first, it was tough to connect with the locals, but fate had other plans, and I formed a bond with a guy living right next door and another fellow on my street. Although they're no longer around, the memories remain vivid. The people who were here when I first arrived are still here, giving our neighborhood a sense of continuity. Our neighborhood is just like any other American suburban neighborhood, with rows of two-story houses lining the streets. You can hear the sound of kids playing outside on weekends or whenever the sun is out, and the neighborhood is generally quiet on most weekdays. I've never had any issues with my neighbors, and I feel like I can trust them completely. When I order packages online, they always arrive safely on my porch. Our neighborhood is the kind of place where you're left alone unless you need help.\n\nJust a minute or two away from my house is a park that holds a special place in my heart. I've spent countless hours playing basketball, football, and baseball there with the guys from the neighborhood. One of my not-so-fond memories also happened there when I got elbowed in the nose during a football game, but the good times far outweigh the bad. Nowadays, I visit the park with my cousin's kids, who are a lot younger and still enjoy the simple joys of swings and slides. Just thinking about heading to the park gets them excited. The park is now a source of nostalgia for me, reminding me of the good old days.\n\nOur neighborhood is a melting pot of cultures, with a wide variety of food options nearby. Within a one-mile radius, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, with the rise of food delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash, many people prefer to have their meals delivered to their doorstep. The most popular food places are the fast food chains, but you can find those in many suburban neighborhoods. There are also plenty of pizza places to choose from. Our stores have everything you need, with multiple dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store on the same street. Some stores even cater to different tastes, like an Indian-owned store for those who want to cook up some homemade Indian dishes or buy pre-made meals.\n\nI'm grateful for my neighborhood, especially after reading about the horror stories of people dealing with difficult neighbors on social media. It's a blessing to have a community like mine.",
            "My hometown is a quaint little place in South Carolina, blending seamlessly into the rest of the landscape. It's not particularly famous, but it's made its mark in the agricultural sector, thanks to its status as the Peach Capital of the World, proudly displayed on the town's welcoming sign. The town is primarily composed of vast farmlands dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses on the outskirts of town are spaced far apart, mostly two-story structures with metal roofs to shield them from the scorching summer heat or gray shingles. Most homes are nestled away from the main road, allowing the front fields to be used for raising animals or growing crops. Downtown, the town's single traffic light hangs at a four-way intersection, marking the spot where the local stores are concentrated. There are a few eateries where you can grab fast food: Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a local family; Fiesta Mexican Restaurant; or Gary's, a small burger chain. A pizzeria once called the town home, but it closed its doors a while back. The Maxwell and Halford Drug pharmacy is a family-owned business, and it's famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola; not many people know that, though. IGA, a small, pricey grocery store, is the only one in town, but many residents prefer to shop at a Walmart in the nearby Batesburg-Leesville for most of their grocery needs. Dollar General, however, is the most popular spot in town, offering a wide range of everyday items and bustling with activity from opening to closing. Possibilities Furniture & More, a quaint furniture store run by a well-respected woman in the community, has been a part of the town for years and even employs two movers to deliver purchased furniture. Next door, Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a small pet groomer, offers various services, including daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and more. The town has two small medical practices, one for humans and one for animals, located outside the main part of town. Johnston Elementary School is the town's only elementary school, and students usually move on to middle and high school in the next town over after completing fifth grade. Although there aren't any parks in town, the local government is in the process of creating a 2.5-acre recreational area to provide families with more opportunities to spend time together and attract new residents. It's a quiet town, with limited entertainment options – no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or \"hangout\" spots, but it's a nice place, so small it's easy to miss while driving by.",
            "I first heard about my neighborhood through a podcast featuring people who'd gone missing in the area. It was quite surprising to hear. Almost every apartment in the place was renting for over a thousand dollars a month – something none of my friends and I had ever heard about. I guess that's what happens when you're struggling. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night due to financial burdens. We've learned to be frugal over the years, though. You start to appreciate the dusty smell of second-hand toys and mothballed clothes. As you grow older, you come to notice you smell less as well. Some people might start smoking, while others just get accustomed to the state of things. However, the flea market always finds a way to assert itself. The smell of adulthood is that of dusty magazines piled on a closed piano, which even persists after you wash it. In my area, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start from the far side, you can visit two charity thrift stores, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling with cars and people every morning, but you'd never hear the noise in the thrift stores. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the stores remain quiet. It's a great place to lose an afternoon. Every year, the downtown area gets more crowded with cars and people. It's a growing city, they say. One of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery is based here, and it's still showing signs of growth pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is focused on their own goals, and people generally don't pry into one another's lives. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. This is different from the South, where being a little concerned means showing you care. Here, people respect your personal space and won't intrude unless you invite them to. It's a lively and welcoming place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment full of strangers and more of a community of friends who come together for our needs, celebrate our birthdays, mourn our losses, and help each other when we can. I'm fortunate to live here. I quite like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I try to clean up after myself and leave food for them, and they do the same for me. I bring their mail and they bring mine. It's nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. Despite living in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl, it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I haven't completely messed up my life.",
            "I live in a typical suburban area that looks like it's been cut out from a cookie cutter. You can't help but notice the presence of a homeowner's association when you first enter the neighborhood. The streets are filled with well-maintained single-family homes, all thanks to the HOA's hard work. The front yards are almost identical, with a small patch of grass, some decorative pebbles, and short driveways. You'll occasionally spot small trees and two-car garages. As you drive through the neighborhood, you'll notice newly paved concrete roads with no potholes in sight. Most houses are single-story, but some have two stories. One thing that stands out is the mailbox system – instead of individual mailboxes in front of each house, there's a large group of mailboxes at the end of the street, and you need a key to access your specific one. There are also two larger lockers for packages. The HOA's love for uniformity is really evident here. My house is located on the outskirts of the nearby city, so my neighborhood feels like a mix of rural and suburban areas. As a result, we have plenty of space for everything – there are multiple community pools that are well-maintained and gated, as well as walking trails where you can take your dog or go for a solo evening stroll. You don't even need to go to a park to get some exercise; just take a run around the neighborhood and you'll get enough. The community is mostly made up of retired people, but we also have a few middle-aged and young professionals living here. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for each other. We have a small town feel despite being part of a larger city, and we have most of the amenities you'd expect – except for one mall, which is surprisingly sufficient. It takes around 15 minutes to drive to anywhere significant, but once you get there, you have access to a variety of stores, from high-end grocery stores to bargain outlets. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty standard – we have our perks, like pools and walking trails, but we're not exactly next door to a shopping district, so you just hop in the car and head to any major chain store you want.",
            "Living in a small Midwestern town just outside the city's suburbs has its unique charm. Our neighborhood on the town's east side, where I reside, is often regarded as the most economically disadvantaged area. Property values are low, with many homes rented or owned by low-income families, yet this doesn't define the community's character. The friendly neighbors I've encountered smile and greet me as I walk down the street, giving our area a welcoming atmosphere.\n\nWhile crime rates are slightly higher than in other parts of town, they remain relatively low. Unfortunately, there have been a few violent incidents nearby, including shootings and a homicide, which shook our community. Our next-door neighbors suffered a personal loss when their son was killed outside a local bar. Fortunately, our family has been spared from direct harm, apart from occasional incidents of theft when we forget to bring items inside.\n\nThe town as a whole has been heavily impacted by the opioid epidemic, which has ravaged many parts of the United States. The loss of lives due to fentanyl overdoses has been devastating. Thankfully, our town has made efforts to combat this crisis through addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected.\n\nDespite these challenges, our town has many redeeming qualities. My son's elementary school boasts an exceptional staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff, creating a positive and supportive environment. His special needs haven't hindered his experience, and he loves attending school. The active Parent-Teacher Organization (PTO) organizes numerous events to foster family involvement and educational growth.\n\nGiven that over 20% of our town's population lives below the poverty line, the elementary school offers free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. The school's inclusive atmosphere treats every child and family with dignity, regardless of their financial situation. Costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are also reasonable, making education accessible to all.\n\nThe City Council and staff have made significant improvements to the town's appearance, including repaving roads, landscaping, and renovating city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have focused on the town's center and west side, where shopping areas and major traffic flow. The east side, where I reside, tends to be neglected, a point of contention for our community.\n\nDespite these issues, I genuinely appreciate living in this town. The residents are friendly, the schools excel, and we have a variety of shopping options to meet our needs. Our home may not be worth much, but it's comfortable and sufficient. After 16 years, our family cannot imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood has a rich cultural heritage, situated on a hill surrounded by buildings steeped in history. My apartment is in a 7-story building directly across from an old theater, and just a short walk away is a trendy arcade bar that attracts people of all walks of life on warm summer nights. The crowds flocking to it on weekends in June and July are a common sight. A short distance from there is a sizeable city park, with concrete surrounding its perimeter and tall stairs integrated into the wall. During harsh winter months, homeless individuals set up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and the wide steps, seeking shelter from the cold and rain. They prefer to congregate in the town center rather than in the outskirts, making it easier to stay warm and access nearby amenities like the family center where they can bathe and shower.\n\nWhat I love about my city isn't its historic architecture or the majestic buildings that dot the hills leading down to the ocean. It's the people themselves who bring the neighborhood to life. You see, Hilltop was notorious in the past for its gang violence, with stories of federal officials and the DEA attempting to clean up the streets decades ago still lingering in the air. The community hasn't forgotten, and these tales are passed down through generations, including to newcomers like me. Despite being considered one of the tougher neighborhoods in the city, residents work hard to keep it clean and look out for one another. They care deeply about their community and the issues that affect it.\n\nLocals often advise visitors not to walk around the Hill at night, a warning that I believe is rooted in the past and tainted by social biases. Perhaps I'm able to blend in because of my dark skin, or maybe the Hilltop community recognizes me as one of their own, someone who's acutely aware of the societal issues that plague our nation. These issues include racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions born out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that prides itself as a melting pot Utopia. One thing is certain: no matter where life takes me, Hilltop will always be home. I feel a sense of belonging walking those streets at night, meeting people who offer me a jacket or a helping hand rather than causing harm. It's a place where laundromat owners stay open late to let me charge my phone in the rain, and where strangers have offered me kindness and reassurance on the darkest of nights, making me feel seen and valued.",
            "I reside in Rural America, in a quaint small town in Michigan. The landscape shifts from rolling farmland to charming tourist cities, and you'll notice the absence of large shopping malls, retail giants like Walmart, Target, or even the likes of Applebee's. To get to any place, a drive is often the only option. Interestingly, amidst this rustic setting, my town is blessed with breathtaking natural beauty, surrounded by two majestic lakes: beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and the serene Lake Charlevoix on the other. Every direction you look, you'll find a picturesque beach perfect for dipping your toes. The neighborhood I call home embodies the essence of a small town. The houses are not cookie-cutter developments, but rather older, unique homes that reflect the character of the area. Some have been lovingly updated and remodeled, while others retain their original charm. Many of these homes boast spacious basements that are visible from the street, and the neighborhood is dotted with a kaleidoscope of colors, thanks to the diverse range of aluminum siding used on the houses. Yards are a common feature, complete with trampolines, playsets, and gardens, while some homes are fenced to keep pets safe. The atmosphere is quintessentially Midwestern, with hardworking families who value tradition and community. On any given day, you'll see kids playing in the streets, people walking their dogs, biking, or rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors, and you can easily spot those who fit in and those who don't. The sense of community is palpable, with friendly waves and warm smiles exchanged between residents. The lawns are well-maintained, with neatly trimmed grass and tidy gardens. It's not a neighborhood that screams \"look at me,\" but rather one that exudes a sense of warmth and welcoming familiarity. Our town is a haven, a place where families can feel safe and secure. Within walking distance, you'll find the county sheriff's department and jail, as well as the local health department and recycling center, which serve the community with dedication. The nearby baseball and softball fields are a hub of activity, with the sound of announcers calling out scores and player names filling the air. Our small-town airport is also nearby, adding to the area's charm. You can walk to get ice cream from the local parlor, or stroll downtown, which is just a short distance away. My kids can easily ride their bikes to the nearby park, which is just a few blocks away. This is a truly wonderful place to call home."
