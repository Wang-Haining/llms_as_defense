            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "City life is a whirlwind of contrasts. My neighborhood is a vibrant tapestry woven from bustling commercial hubs and quieter residential pockets. It's a kaleidoscope of experiences, with towering office buildings standing shoulder-to-shoulder with quirky boutiques and tempting restaurants.  Everywhere you turn, there's something new to discover, whether it's a trendy eatery, a hidden gem of a store, or a lively entertainment venue.  \n\nWhile giant corporations cast long shadows over the landscape, independent shops are finding their footing, adding a touch of individuality to the urban fabric. They're scattered throughout the city, popping up in bustling malls and lining the streets, often within easy walking distance of serene residential areas. \n\nParks offer a welcome respite from the city's energy, filled with families enjoying carefree moments with their children.  \n\nPeople from all walks of life call this neighborhood home.  Right here, you'll find a vibrant LGBTQ+ community, a devout Orthodox Jewish enclave, and a diverse mix of immigrants, many hailing from the former Soviet Union.\n\nVenture a little further afield, and you'll encounter even more ethnic enclaves—Korea Town, China Town, Little Armenia—each a testament to the city's multicultural heart.\n\nIt's a city of contrasts, where close proximity can feel worlds apart. A mere ten miles can easily stretch into a two-hour journey during rush hour, a testament to the city's notorious traffic congestion.  \n\nWhile some attractions are within walking distance, the sheer size of the city makes walking a daunting proposition.  This reliance on cars has resulted in a feverish pace of life, with parking a constant battle. \n\nIronically, amidst this gridlock, new apartment buildings seem to sprout overnight, fueled by a constant influx of newcomers. Residents, however, share a sense of apprehension, wondering if the city's charm will be lost amidst the ever-growing crowds and traffic. \n\nThere's a diverse range of housing options, though.  Not everyone craves the anonymity of a high-rise.\n\nResidential areas offer a mix of houses, ranging from cozy bungalows to sprawling mansions, along with smaller apartment buildings and condominiums.  Some streets are lined with single-family homes, while others cluster together duplexes.  \n\nEven within my immediate neighborhood, there's a surprising variety of housing choices, reflecting the city's dynamic nature. \n\nThe neighborhood itself is a melting pot of ages, with many faces remaining strangers. While I cherish memories of childhood friendships and neighborhood gatherings, the modern landscape feels less intimate.",
            "My neighborhood is a curious blend of the past and present. Most of the houses are traditional single-family homes, but a few have been cleverly divided into two units while still staying connected.  My own place has a small front yard and a modest driveway. It, like many others, whispers of a bygone era when suburban life represented the quintessential American Dream. This dream, once so warmly embraced, now seems to be drifting away, yet my neighborhood, along with countless others, clings to it, whispering that the dream is still alive, though perhaps fading.\n\nThe residents, while not as optimistic as they once were, still hold onto this dream. Their yards, though not as meticulously kept, still hold the faint echo of that era. You'll see a couple of cars in most driveways, and children playing as if the world itself revolves around them.\n\nThe local public school, a landmark that has stood for almost 90 years, continues to inspire hope in the young while evoking nostalgia in the older generation. Churches are scarce, mostly empty, but the basketball courts buzz with activity. Each house may have a unique look, but they share a similar feeling, a sense of shared history.\n\nThere's a large supermarket, \"Super A,\" owned by a prominent Yemeni family, perhaps the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The majority of residents are African American. Wide streets see children playing football, their games interrupted only by passing cars.\n\nMany people here have lived here for generations, their families woven into the fabric of the community. They can tell stories of a time when everyone knew everyone.\n\nThe neighborhood has seen changes, too. The karate school, once thriving following the \"Karate Kid\" craze, has been replaced by a pharmacy - perhaps reflecting a shift in priorities. The small movie theater, screening classic films at discounted prices, struggles to attract younger crowds but remains a beloved spot for the older generation seeking a nostalgic escape.\n\nThe town is intersected by a major expressway, although its entrances and exits are located in the neighboring town. There was a time when residents tried to secure an exit for our town, but the younger generation supported it while the older generation opposed it, fearing disruption.\n\nConstruction is underway for a new high school, and the town is grappling with choosing a mascot, a symbol to represent us. Perhaps a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the perfect embodiment of our unique blend of old and new.",
            "It's easy to overlook, tucked away behind shops and a rundown supermarket, an unlikely place for a community to thrive. But venture past the desolate hotels, only bustling during fleeting family reunions, and you'll discover a vibrant world brimming with life. \n\nImagine a row of apartment buildings, nestled together like disassembled Russian nesting dolls, each story whispering tales of its own.  Some bear the scars of past controversies, their news-worthy reputations overshadowing the quiet havens nestled beside them.  Beyond those lie communities brimming with secrets, hidden from the prying eyes of the wider world.\n\nAcross the street, a community college campus hums with a sleepy energy. Students, clutching steaming coffee, stumble towards classes, their mornings a symphony of yawns and hurried steps.  Their quiet routines clash with the impatient honks of commuters, whose patience thins on days when the student influx brings traffic to a crawl. \n\nThe road branches, leading to a residential haven where a park stretches green and inviting.  A rehabilitation center, with its cheerful porch furniture and lazy ceiling fan, stands sentinel beside it, offering solace to those who've fallen.  Children revel in the park's grassy expanse, their laughter echoing as they cartwheel and twirl amidst vibrant flower patches, while retired folks stroll with their canine companions, their eyes crinkling with amusement as they observe the teenagers' antics.\n\nA strip mall, a quintessential slice of Americana, sits nearby.  A sushi restaurant, perpetually uncrowded but offering affordable delights, stands beside a swimming supply store, inviting customers to stock up for the season.  A nail salon, tucked between them, promises pampering and polish. Here, one can indulge in a manicure while indulging in hibachi chicken and planning a pool party, a testament to the convenience of a well-stocked strip mall. A frozen yogurt shop, a haven for teens, offers a sweet reprieve with its DIY concoctions, their sugary swirls often paired with skateboarding tricks and puffs of vape.\n\nThis neighborhood, a tapestry woven with threads of Americana, whispers tales of a time when life moved at a slower pace. It's a place where history lingers, and the rhythm of life unfolds with a gentle, unchanging cadence.",
            "She asked, bewildered as we passed the endless cornfields stretching across the horizon, \"Where is everything?\"  \"This is it!\" I replied, knowing she wouldn't be prepared for this vast, open landscape. Coming from a town where the grocery store was just a stone's throw away, she'd never encountered such expansiveness. Overwhelmed by the sheer number of cornfields, I shared stories of growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood who I was and where I came from.\n\nOur journey continued down a winding country road, leading us to a quarry filled with water. Just past it lay the small development where I lived.  The houses, mostly brick and stucco, each boasted at least half an acre of land, meticulously tended by their proud owners. Spring brought a riot of color with planted flowers bursting alongside the native trees, changing with every season. Gleaming Mercedes Benz luxury cars lined the driveways, their polished surfaces reflecting the midday sun after a meticulous car wash.\n\nAs we approached my own grey stucco home, our Korean neighbor, always with a friendly face, greeted us. He spent his days diligently mowing his lawn, his cheerful singing carried on the hum of his mower.  Everyone found his dedication amusing, but he was a genuine and remarkable individual with a rich past. His sharp wit had mellowed with age; he was a retired doctor, now blending in with the grass and his John Deere Zero Turn mower.\n\nFinally, we arrived at my house. Geese waddled in the side yard, chased by our energetic terrier.  A small stream flowed behind the house, feeding into the quarry.  The air hummed with the sounds of bullfrogs, the gurgling stream, and the occasional low moo from nearby farms. Across a handcrafted wooden bridge lay a secluded oasis, untouched and brimming with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was my childhood sanctuary: a place where tree forts were built, imaginary animals were hunted, and friendships blossomed.\n\nWinters in my small town could be harsh, yet undeniably beautiful. The vibrant greens of summer transformed into a barren wilderness. Trees, once adorned with colorful blossoms, stood as skeletal reminders of their past glory.  Snowfall, when it blessed us, transformed the world into a winter wonderland overnight.  Snow angels and snowmen dotted the backyard, testaments to my sister and me, who waged epic snowball wars.  We built massive igloo-like forts, armed with branches, creating our own winter fortress. In this magical realm, we lost ourselves in pretend, our childhood worries melting away. We were simply children, free and carefree.",
            "Portland, Oregon, has a unique spirit, a vibe that's captured in its unofficial motto: \"Keep Portland Weird.\"  This phrase, emblazoned on a building that somehow manages to be a pizza place, bar, music venue, and strip club all at once, speaks to a city that celebrates its eccentricities. For some, it's a nostalgic reminder of a time when Portland was less known and more affordable, a haven for creative and unconventional subcultures. For others, it's an invitation to embrace the city's quirky charm, where being a little different is not just accepted, it's celebrated.\n\nDespite the influx of wealthier residents from California and the rise of modern condos, Portland still holds onto its unique character.  \"Weird\" in Portland doesn't mean rejecting everything conventional; it means embracing the unconventional alongside the ordinary. We have our share of yoga studios, hipsters, and business professionals, just like any other city. Perhaps Portland's \"weirdness\" lies in our ability to take it all a little less seriously. \n\nIn my neighborhood, as in many others, vibrant houses line the streets, adorned with colorful gardens overflowing with flowers, herbs, and vegetables.  And then there are the \"free boxes\" that appear in the summertime – cardboard boxes (or sometimes plastic bags) filled with cast-off treasures. You never know what you might find inside – clothes, books, perhaps even a hidden gem that's perfect for someone wandering by.\n\nThis sense of possibility, of finding magic in the unexpected, is what makes Portland special for me.  Of course, Portland is a diverse city, and \"weird\" takes on many forms.  While some might shy away from a free box, others might be drawn to goat yoga or cheering on the Timbers, the city's soccer team.\n\nPortland is a place where people pursue their dreams, or at least dream about it over a few beers at their favorite bar.  Like any city, Portland faces its share of challenges – a drug problem, a homeless population that strains our resources – issues rooted in mental health and a lack of affordable housing.",
            "The mountains are a constant presence, steadfast sentinels watching over the sunrise and sunset to the north. No matter how preoccupied I get with work or life's demands, they remain, unyielding and unmoved by the world's turmoil. On days when stress threatens to overwhelm me, they beckon me to look up, offering solace and a renewed sense of strength. It was the sight of these mountains that first captured my heart when I arrived for college, their majesty surpassing even the university's own beauty, with its charming buildings, serene ponds, and vibrant trees.  While the town itself boasts its own unique charm—quaint cafes buzzing with late-night study sessions, and a downtown area steeped in history—it's the mountains that reign supreme. They stand as a constant reminder of resilience and the enduring power of nature.\n\nThis town is a fascinating blend of bustling urban energy and peaceful suburban charm.  Just a short walk from the university, downtown pulses with life, its faded brick facades lining restaurants and offices, reflecting the vibrancy of its neighboring city. But step past the library, and the serene atmosphere of a small town returns. This juxtaposition of atmospheres creates a captivating energy, inviting exploration and the creation of lasting memories. Whether it's sharing late-night laughter with friends beneath the rusty swings in the park or rushing through the lively downtown to catch a movie in the university-sponsored theater, each corner of this town holds a story.\n\nYet, like all places, it harbors both joy and sorrow. The ponds, in particular, have witnessed my share of both reflection and tears. As I've watched turtles, ducks, and insects living out their lives, each with its purpose, I've often pondered my own place in this perplexing world.  Seeking solace, I would walk past the pond, the park, and the quintessential suburban homes, until I reached a main street. There, bathed in the golden light of dawn, the palm trees stood tall against the backdrop of the mountains.  As I glanced up at the sky, I realized I was walking north, towards the enduring presence that had always been there. They stood tall, unyielding, their peaks piercing the hazy blue and yellow sky, a silent message of perseverance whispering to my soul.",
            "Venturing into Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, won't leave you lost.  New York City's famed public transportation system is readily available, making it a breeze to navigate this vibrant neighborhood.  Bensonhurst retains the energetic pulse of the city, but with a distinct cultural flavor.  Prepare to be immersed in a tapestry of Asian culture as you stroll through its streets, adorned with Asian-owned businesses at nearly every corner.  \n\nOver the past two decades, Bensonhurst has welcomed a wave of Asian residents, transforming its landscape.  Supermarkets and laundromats, beloved by both locals and newcomers, dominate the retail scene. The allure?  Exceptional quality, competitive prices, and unmatched convenience.  Just a stone's throw from my current location, four Asian supermarkets stand within a two-minute radius, a testament to the neighborhood's commitment to accessibility. \n\n While Asian culture is undeniably prominent, Bensonhurst embraces diversity in all its forms.  Immigrants and their descendants, woven into the fabric of the community, contribute to a rich and vibrant tapestry.  \n\nBeyond the bustling commercial scene lies a recently renovated park, a haven for recreation.  Ten basketball courts, a sprawling field perfect for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a children's playground, and even a refreshing water fountain for summer days, cater to a wide range of interests.  True to the spirit of New York City, the park pulsates with a kaleidoscope of cultures, where individuals from all walks of life come together in harmony.\n\nThe architectural landscape of Bensonhurst is predominantly residential.  Co-op buildings and condominiums stand alongside charming two-family houses, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere.  While the residents are generally friendly, the neighborhood is known for its lively ambiance.  \n\nBe prepared for the soundtrack of city life, with cars rumbling by, their music echoing through the streets, and the occasional revving engine that might disrupt your morning slumber.  \n\nThough generally safe, Bensonhurst is a reminder that vigilance is key in any urban environment.  Encountering individuals seeking trouble or engaging in petty theft is not unheard of.  Personal experiences with bullying and package theft have highlighted the importance of exercising caution, especially during nighttime hours.\n\nFinally, while New York City enforces regulations for pet owners, the reality in Bensonhurst is that dog waste often litters sidewalks and pathways.  A jarring sight, especially on your morning commute or grocery run.  Keep your eyes peeled and your shoes clean!",
            "Life here feels like a constant uphill climb. My house sits perched atop the steepest hill in the neighborhood, a place nicknamed the \"work out hill\" because joggers love to test their strength against its incline.  Since there are no sidewalks, everyone walks on the road, which is pockmarked and a little treacherous.  Overhead, the power lines look like a jumbled mess, patched up after countless storms that batter our area with rain and wind.  Branches and debris often bring them crashing down, leaving them looking more like a patchwork quilt than an organized network. Evergreen trees crowd the landscape, but locals seem to despise them, constantly trying to cut them down to clear the view of the ocean. That's why so many houses are built high on the hills, boasting huge, glass-fronted second stories that strain for a glimpse of the bay.\n\nThe sunsets are breathtaking, though. The water glows from below as the sky turns orange, but the sky is often shrouded in clouds, casting a haze over the sun's rays. Most days are overcast and damp, with moss clinging to everything it can: roofs, cars, railings.  I once left my car parked in the driveway for a month, and when I returned, it was covered in a thick, furry layer of moss. It took me hours to scrub it all off.  The neighborhood itself is mostly populated by retirees, with few children around.  Dogs, however, are plentiful, often seen lounging in yards or racing down the street.  They're known for their boldness, even sneaking into houses if a door or window is left open.\n\nI once found one napping in my living room and had to gently shoo it back outside. Rabbits are another common sight, though they're considered pests by gardeners because they dig up plants and burrow in lawns. My cats, however, delight in chasing them, and have successfully thinned their numbers in our area. We also have the usual assortment of birds: sparrows, hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle, until the neighborhood crows chase them away.\n\nThere aren't any shops nearby, but a short hike down to the waterfront offers a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. The beach itself is small, but the rocky shore provides a fun place to launch stones into the water. The bay is narrow enough that you can see the opposite shoreline even through the mist on most days.",
            "Life in our neighborhood is pretty typical for a small town in Tennessee. We're on a connecting street between two main roads, so there's more traffic than I'd prefer, but it's still a peaceful place. People tend to stay put here, so I've gotten to know most folks.  Days are filled with the usual routines – yard work, chores, the daily grind. When winter rolls around, the kids head down the hill on our street for some sledding fun.  \n\nOur house sits on the corner, so we're the first to see everyone coming and going. We've learned to recognize most of the cars, so when we spot something unfamiliar, it catches our attention. Some neighbors take walks to stay active or walk their dogs. Kids whiz by on bikes, just like in any other neighborhood.\n\nWe work from home, so we're around a lot. It's just the four of us: me, my wife, and our daughters, who are eleven and fourteen.  Everyone around here knows us well, and we're used to seeing them come and go too.\n\nWe love to get outside, even when it rains. We fire up the grill on our back deck from time to time, and the smell of barbecue fills the air. You can always hear the sound of lawnmowers buzzing away from March to October, when the grass finally decides to take a break.  \n\nOur neighborhood used to be a wooded area, so we have plenty of trees, which provides lots of shade. But, come fall, those leaves take over! We spend a lot of time raking and burning them, which always feels like a welcome sign that autumn is here. This year, we haven't had much of a winter, so it feels like we're stuck in a perpetual fall.  Our garage is at the back of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone comes knocking, which isn't often.  \n\nWhen I work on my truck or other projects in the garage with the doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays bring a little more hustle and bustle. Thanksgiving is a busy time with family from out of town, and cars are parked everywhere. It's the same story for Mother's Day and Christmas. \n\nAll in all, I really like living here. It would be perfect if it weren't for the through-traffic.",
            "My neighborhood sits right smack dab in the high desert, a land of endless brown dirt. Unless you've lived here, it's hard to grasp the feeling of that constant brown expanse stretching out before you.  When you do spot a lawn, you know that person's shelling out serious cash to keep it green. Back in the '90s, when I first moved here, houses were spread out like stars across the desert. Now, it's still pretty spread out, but there are a lot more houses popping up.  This place is starting to look more and more like a city every day, which is probably true for most places.  The people here are mostly friendly, though like any city, you get your share of good and bad. My neighborhood is surrounded by kind, older folks, which makes it feel pretty nice. \n\nAs for shopping, it's mostly chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final.  For anything upscale, you gotta drive a bit. I don't see many Whole Foods or similar stores around here.\n\nBased on what I see, construction seems to be the biggest industry in town. I think that's because the city is still growing and has lots of open space to build on. That does worry me a bit; I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not eager to go back. Speaking of construction, that's actually where I work – I'm a drywall and T-bar installer.\n\n\nWhat I love most about living here is the wildlife. People come to the high desert for all sorts of reasons, but the stark beauty of the desert itself is a big draw. The unique climate and landscape here have created challenging ecosystems that need protecting, and they're home to all sorts of amazing creatures.  It's important for us humans who live here to learn about the wildlife around us so we can co-exist peacefully. My family and I have adapted really well to living with the animals. My three kids are obsessed with lizards and desert bugs – right now, they're outside trying to catch some specimens.\n\nThere are a few attractions in the area, and Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert in a unique way. If you're visiting, check out the annual San Bernardino County Fair – it's a blast! And if you want to see snow-capped mountains, take a trip to nearby Wrightwood for some winter sports.\n\nIf you're interested in the history and culture of the high desert, the Victor Valley Museum is worth a visit. They have geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of Victorville's development.",
            "Describing my neighborhood is a bit unusual, I think. While others might picture houses and families, my \"neighborhood\" is the college campus I call home. My dorm building is my close-knit community, and the wider campus extends outwards, forming a larger, albeit less intimate, neighborhood. Despite this difference, my campus neighborhood shares similarities with traditional ones. Like any neighborhood, it has its own houses, people, shops, and even a park. Let's explore these \"houses\" first.\n\nThere are three main types of living spaces in my area: apartments, regular houses, and dormitory buildings. Apartments typically house 2-4 people per room, with 4-6 rooms per floor, meaning around 20 residents per building. Then there are the regular houses, rented by anyone affiliated with the school, usually alumni in 2-4 bedroom setups. These are less common, though. Finally, there are the dorm rooms, the most prevalent type, where hundreds of students live, usually two per room.\n\nMy school prides itself on diversity, and this is reflected in my neighborhood. People from all walks of life and backgrounds call this place home. The staff often live in the houses scattered around the campus, while newer students gravitate towards dorms and older students prefer apartments.\n\nDescribing the people in this neighborhood is a task in itself, as they are as diverse and unique as the houses they live in.  Perhaps it's best to move on to the stores and park that make up our little community.\n\nBeing a self-contained world, the campus boasts a variety of shops, including restaurants, the university's own clothing and grocery stores, and everything else one might need. The park serves as a common ground for everyone, kept safe and clean by the collective effort of the neighborhood.",
            "After ten years in this neighborhood, I've learned a lot. When I first moved here from Riverdale to Stockbridge, I was heartbroken. Leaving my friends and family behind was tough, but my parents believed this move to Stockbridge would be better for us – better housing, a better high school, a \"better\" life overall.  It took time to adjust, but I made new friends and some enemies at school. My only real connection with the neighbors was with Mr. Glen and his children, and Dennis for a while, since they lived right next door. They've been like family to me, and I cherish that.\n\nI'll never forget attending Mr. Glen's remarriage – it was a blast. Seeing them so happy gave me hope for my own future, for the day I can build a life with my future wife and give her the world. Watching Ms. Veda toss her garter, and me catching it! (I didn't catch the bouquet, though!), was a highlight. Dancing the night away with Marsharii, one of their daughters, was another cherished memory. I hope she's doing well.\n\nThe neighborhood is a maze, but now with GPS, I'm exploring more. I've ventured out with my friends Kason and Curtis, mainly to places where we'd play video games and soak up life. Sometimes, I find peace in the nearby park, surrounded by nature, letting it soothe my soul. I even practice my balance with sticks I bought from Home Depot and sometimes bring my bokken wooden sword for some training.\n\nThere's a basketball and tennis court, though I haven't played much lately. Still, it's there if I ever feel like dusting off those skills. My dad and my best friend were tennis fanatics, coached by Mr. Graves, and we had a blast playing under his tough but loving guidance.\n\nLooking back, there are countless fun memories from this neighborhood, but these stand out. I know the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood, a stone's throw from my college, feels like a cozy little haven.  It's a mix of apartment buildings, sprinkled with a few budget-friendly restaurants and bars that offer a lively atmosphere. One bar recently got a makeover and upped its prices, but the quality's not noticeably better, just pricier.  Mostly, the people here are friendly college students or folks making ends meet in the reasonably priced apartments. There are plenty of kids around because of the elementary school just a quick walk away. I keep to myself, though, not really knowing my neighbors. They're quite fond of marijuana, which led the building management to install an air freshener right outside their door - a comical, almost insulting, remedy. The surrounding buildings are mostly older, some with updated interiors, while down the street are brand-new apartments. But those are a no-go for me. They look cheaply built, despite the exorbitant rent. The management, capitalizing on the proximity to campus, gets away with charging a premium.\n\nThere's a ridiculously cheap eatery nearby, serving everything on paper plates and relying heavily on the microwave. Across from it, a gas station, rumored to be a dreadful place to work. But last summer, thanks to some city funding, the road got a makeover. Now, there's a wide sidewalk, lush medians, and a touch of greenery. My building, however, is tucked away under a canopy of trees. They've chopped down a few, leaving behind stumps, but there are still plenty more trees here than down the road. Behind my complex is a treeline, followed by another set of apartments. My street, 42nd, is quiet compared to 43rd right behind it. Sidewalks are crumbling, buildings look worn, and the trees seem to be hiding a less-than-pleasant truth. Most of the area's crime has stemmed from an apartment complex on 43rd, but it's not solely their fault. The complex across from me has also seen its share of trouble and a high turnover rate.\n\nDespite it all, I find myself content here. It's affordable, and I have everything I need within easy reach.  The college is a pleasant walk away, and two bus stops provide easy access to stores and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood feels like a throwback to simpler times. It's made up of duplexes scattered along a cul-de-sac, spaced out so they look like individual houses.  They all share the same cheery yellow paint, white porches, and green metal roofs, giving them a distinctive charm. Most of the folks here know each other, and you'll often find us gathered at the ends of our driveways in the evenings, chatting while the kids play. It's a welcome change from the constant digital buzz of the modern world. We're surrounded by fields and trees, with the sky often painted with blue hues and fluffy white clouds.  \n\nLife here is peaceful, but lately, we've had to contend with tornado warnings. Last night, the sirens wailed, and for the first time, we had to seek shelter. I ended up in my bathtub with my little dog, my purse, and some pillows. My big dog wasn't keen on the idea and stayed in the living room, whining nervously. The air was filled with the sound of hail pounding on the roof.  After the storm passed, the road steamed from the drastic temperature change. It was like a scene out of a movie. The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement, and as the clouds parted, a double rainbow arched across the sky. I grabbed my camera and snapped a few shots to share with friends and family.  \n\nThings quickly returned to normal, with kids back playing and moms gathering outside as dinner cooked. It's a friendly place, and I feel right at home here. I especially love the southern accents - it adds a special warmth to the atmosphere. \n\nI live in a two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment, like everyone else, but the interiors are unique. Some are surprisingly small. I enjoy taking walks in the field behind my home, down to a pond where I've seen deer and heard a giant bullfrog croaking in the mornings. It's a beautiful place to live, just a short drive from Charlotte. The mornings are filled with the sounds of roosters crowing from nearby farms. It truly feels like a small village, complete with a donkey at a nearby farm who brays in the evenings.  I feel incredibly lucky to have found this peaceful haven.",
            "I moved into this neighborhood right before starting eighth grade. Making friends was tough at first, but I eventually became close with someone just two houses down and another guy on my street. They've both moved away now, but the memories linger. Most of the original folks who lived here when I arrived are still around. It's a pretty typical American suburb – lots of two-story houses, kids playing outside every weekend when the weather's nice, and a pretty quiet atmosphere most days. I've never had any issues with the neighbors. You get a sense of privacy here unless you need something, and I've ordered plenty of packages online without any porch pirates. I feel like I can trust them. There's a park just a short walk from my house, bursting with memories. I played basketball, football, and baseball there with the neighborhood guys back in the day. I even have one pretty awful memory of getting elbowed in the nose during a football game, but the good times definitely outweigh the bad. Now, whenever I go to the park, it's to hang out with my cousin's kids. They're much younger and still love swings and slides. Just mentioning the park gets them excited, which makes me feel nostalgic for simpler times. The neighborhood itself is really diverse. You can find all kinds of cuisines within a mile radius – Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian – you name it. Though, with apps like GrubHub and DoorDash, a lot of people just have their food delivered now. Fast food chains are popular, as you'd expect in any suburb, along with plenty of pizza places.  \n\nThe stores here have everything you could need. There are multiple dry cleaners, a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is a local favorite. There's even an Indian-owned store if you're craving homemade or ready-made Indian dishes.  Overall, I really like living here. Reading about other people's neighborhood struggles online and in the news makes me appreciate mine even more.",
            "Johnston, nestled in South Carolina, is a small town that might blend in with others, yet it holds a special place in the agricultural world.  The town proudly calls itself the \"Peach Capital of the World,\" a title reflected in the vast peach orchards and sprawling cattle farms that dominate the landscape. Houses, mostly two-story structures with metal roofs or gray shingles, are scattered across the countryside, often set back from the roads to create open fields for livestock and crops. \n\nThe heart of Johnston beats around a single stoplight, marking the intersection of four roads and serving as the center for the town's small businesses.  Three \"fast food\" options cater to locals' cravings: Hong Kong, a family-run Chinese restaurant; Fiesta Mexican Restaurant; and Gary's, a local burger chain.  Gone are the days of the town's pizzeria, leaving a gap in the culinary landscape.  Maxwell and Halford Drug, a quaint family pharmacy, stands out for its unique offering - Cherry Coca-Cola.  IGA, a small but pricier grocery store, serves as the sole supermarket, but many residents venture to the larger Walmart in nearby Batesburg-Leesville for their grocery needs.  Dollar General, however, reigns supreme as the most popular spot, bustling with activity as residents stock up on everyday essentials.\n\nPossibilities Furniture & More, a beloved local furniture store run by a kind woman, offers a wide selection and even provides delivery services.  Attached is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet grooming service offering daycare, boarding, and a range of grooming options.  Both a doctor's office and a veterinary clinic, though small, provide essential healthcare services to the community.  Johnston Elementary School educates students up to fifth grade, after which they attend middle and high school in the neighboring town.\n\nWhile the town currently lacks dedicated parks, a 2.5-acre recreational area is in development, aiming to provide outdoor space for families and attract new residents.  Life in Johnston is relatively quiet, with no cinemas, bowling alleys, or bustling entertainment venues.  Despite its simplicity, it offers a peaceful charm and a strong sense of community.",
            "My journey to this place started with a podcast, one about vanished people. It was a surprise, especially since every apartment in the area cost over a thousand dollars a month.  No one I knew, not even my friends, had ever heard that story. Maybe it's the struggle, the way life can wear you down. I know some friends cry themselves to sleep at night, overwhelmed by the cost of everything. We've learned to be frugal, though, finding joy in the dusty charm of flea market treasures and secondhand clothes. There's a certain aroma that comes with adulthood, a scent of mothballs and old paperbacks, lingering even after a wash.  Here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. Starting at one end, you can visit two charity shops, a library, a rare book store, and even a curio shop. Downtown is bustling, filled with cars and people every morning, but within those thrift stores, there's a silence that's almost sacred. Outside noise fades away, and it's easy to lose yourself for an afternoon.  The city's growing, that's for sure. More cars, more people, every year. They call it a developing city, boasting a major online empire for e-commerce and delivery. It reminds me of New York, a place where everyone is focused on their own path, with little expectation of anything else. You can be alone, quiet, independent, and people won't pry. Unlike the South, where showing concern is seen as caring, here, people keep themselves to themselves. You can keep your distance, your walls up, and the city will roll on, indifferent like waves on the shore. It's a vibrant place, full of life.  With the pianist next door and the two amateur singers upstairs, there's always a soundtrack playing. We're not just strangers in an apartment building, but more like a community of friends, coming together for birthdays, funerals, and offering support when needed. I feel fortunate to be here, surrounded by kind neighbors. We look out for each other, sharing food, helping with mail, and simply enjoying each other's company.  I live in a massive, impersonal concrete jungle, but it's these connections, these neighbors, that make me feel like I haven't lost my way.",
            "This neighborhood is like a textbook example of suburbia – picture cookie-cutter houses and a homeowner's association that's always on top of things. Every house is a single-family home, all neatly kept, with a patch of grass, some decorative pebbles, and short driveways.  You'll see a lot of two-car garages, and the roads are spotless, thanks to that HOA. Most of the houses are one story, but you'll occasionally spot a two-story one adding some variety.\n\nForget those individual mailboxes you see elsewhere; here, everyone shares a big cluster of mailboxes at the end of the street, like in an apartment building.  There are even giant lockers for packages – can you guess who's behind that uniformity obsession? You got it, the HOA. \n\nMy house is on the outskirts of the city, so the neighborhood has a bit of a rural feel mixed in with the suburban.  That means there's plenty of space for things like multiple community pools, which are gated and well-maintained. There are also walking trails for those who like to stroll or walk their dogs. You don't need a park for exercise; you can just run around the neighborhood and get your steps in.\n\nMostly, the neighborhood is full of retirees, and it's a very safe place where everyone looks out for each other.  There are a few middle-aged and young professionals mixed in too. The city itself is surprisingly large but still feels like a small town with a friendly vibe.  We have everything you need, like a mall - it's not huge, but it does the trick.  A 15-minute drive takes you to all the big stores you could want, from fancy organic grocery stores to bargain outlets with just the essentials.\n\nOverall, my neighborhood is safe, tidy, and pretty typical. We have nice amenities like pools and trails, and while we're not right next to shopping, a quick drive gets you to anything you need.",
            "My town is a small Midwestern place tucked just outside the bustling suburbs of a big city. My neighborhood, on the east side, has its struggles. It's the part of town where money is tighter, with many renting or owning homes that aren't worth much. But it's not a bad place. My neighbors are friendly folks who greet me with smiles and waves. Sure, crime is a bit more common here than in other parts of town, with a few shootings and even a homicide in recent years. Sadly, our neighbors lost their son to gun violence outside a bar last year. Thankfully, we haven't been directly touched by crime beyond the occasional missing item from our porch. Like many places, our town has been hit hard by the opioid crisis. Fentanyl overdoses have taken too many lives.  But there's hope. We have great resources here, like rehab centers and Narcan training to help families facing addiction.  Despite these challenges, there's a lot to love about this town. My son's elementary school is fantastic. From the principal to the teachers and support staff, they're all wonderful. My son, who has special needs, feels safe and accepted there, and he loves going to school. Our active PTO organizes events all year round to get families involved and support learning. Because so many families struggle financially, the school provides free breakfast and lunch for every student, making sure no child goes hungry. They don't judge anyone based on their ability to pay, and they keep school fees and costs for supplies and field trips very reasonable. The city council has been working hard to spruce up town, repaving roads, planting flowers, and fixing up parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have been focused on the central area and the west side, where most of the shops and traffic are. The east side, where I live, seems to be forgotten, which is frustrating for those of us who live here.  All things considered, I'm happy living in this town.  People are friendly, the schools are great, we have plenty of shopping options, and while our home might not be worth much, it's comfortable and it's ours.  We've lived here for over 16 years, and we can't imagine being anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood pulsates with a vibrant culture, nestled upon a hilltop adorned with buildings steeped in history. I reside in a seven-story apartment building directly across from a historic theater, and just a short distance away, a quirky arcade bar beckons diverse crowds on warm summer evenings, often brimming with lines of eager patrons, especially during those languid June and July weekends.  A short stroll takes me to the nearest city park, a sprawling green oasis amidst the urban landscape. Surrounding it is a concrete perimeter, punctuated by towering staircases embedded in the wall. During the harsh winter months, when icy winds bite and the rain falls in relentless sheets, a community of individuals experiencing homelessness find refuge in neat rows of tents, strategically positioned along the sidewalks and steps.  Their proximity to each other, and the heart of the city, provides a measure of warmth and accessibility to essential resources like the nearby family center, offering a sanctuary for showers and meals. \n\nYet, my affection for this city transcends its historic grandeur - the towering edifices, the intricate architecture that adorns the undulating hills leading down to the ocean. My heart is captivated by the spirit of its people.  Hilltop, once notorious for gang violence on the West Coast, still echoes with tales of the government's relentless pursuit to eradicate the issue. These stories, passed down through generations, serve as a constant reminder of the neighborhood's past struggles. Despite its reputation as one of the city's rougher areas, the residents persevere, diligently tending to their community, their spirits unbroken.  Warnings against venturing out alone at night, particularly for those who are not from the neighborhood, linger - echoes of a bygone era. Perhaps it is my own complexion, allowing me to blend in, or maybe Hilltop recognizes a kindred spirit in me, someone who shares a deep understanding of the insidious nature of societal prejudice and assumptions that plague our nation. Regardless, I feel an undeniable connection to this place.\n\nHilltop is home.  Walking its streets at night, I am enveloped by a sense of belonging.  I have been offered warmth and kindness by strangers, their generosity outweighing any fear.  It is a place where a laundromat owner extended their closing time to let me charge my phone during a torrential downpour, a place where, on a particularly bleak night, a stranger saw me huddled in the shadows and offered me not just five dollars, but a look of genuine connection, affirming my worth and beauty.",
            "I call a slice of Rural America home, specifically a small town in Michigan. Imagine a world where farmland seamlessly blends into quaint tourist spots, but forget the hustle and bustle of big city life – no sprawling malls, no chain stores like Walmart or Target, not even the familiar red neon of an Applebee's.  Getting around means a car is your constant companion.  \n\nYet, here I live in one of the most breathtaking places on Earth, surrounded by water. My town is cradled by the beauty of Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix, with beaches beckoning from every corner.\n\nOur neighborhood embodies the spirit of small-town charm. Houses aren't huddled together like sardines, each one a unique story etched in brick and wood. Some have been lovingly updated, while others wear their age proudly.  Most boast full basements, visible from the street, and many sport classic aluminum siding in a rainbow of colors. \n\nFront yards are a common sight, bursting with life: trampolines bouncing, playsets clamoring, gardens bursting with blooms, and fences guarding furry friends.  It's a picture of Middle America: hardworking families raising children, creating memories, and forging a sense of community. \n\nKids chase each other down sidewalks, dogs get their daily exercise, and neighbors greet each other with waves and smiles. Lawns are manicured, reflecting a quiet pride in their surroundings. There's no extravagant display of wealth here, but a simple, genuine warmth that speaks volumes. \n\nThis isn't a neighborhood that shouts its beauty; it whispers it. It's a place where you can picture raising a family, where kids can play freely, and where the air is thick with the promise of peace.\n\nJust a stone's throw away, you'll find the sheriff's department and jail, the health department, and the recycling center, all symbols of community responsibility. The sound of cheers from nearby baseball and softball fields mixes with the rumble of small planes taking off and landing at the nearby airport.  Even a craving for ice cream can be satisfied with a short walk, and for those who dare, a bike ride can take you to the heart of town. \n\nIt's a simple life, but a good one. It's a place where I can truly feel at home."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "City life is a whirlwind of contrasts. My neighborhood is a vibrant tapestry woven from bustling commercial hubs and quieter residential pockets. It's a kaleidoscope of experiences, with towering office buildings standing shoulder-to-shoulder with quirky boutiques and tempting restaurants.  Everywhere you turn, there's something new to discover, whether it's a trendy eatery, a hidden gem of a store, or a lively entertainment venue.  \n\nWhile giant corporations cast long shadows over the landscape, independent shops are finding their footing, adding a touch of individuality to the urban fabric. They're scattered throughout the city, popping up in bustling malls and lining the streets, often within easy walking distance of serene residential areas. \n\nParks offer a welcome respite from the city's energy, filled with families enjoying carefree moments with their children.  \n\nPeople from all walks of life call this neighborhood home.  Right here, you'll find a vibrant LGBTQ+ community, a devout Orthodox Jewish enclave, and a diverse mix of immigrants, many hailing from the former Soviet Union.\n\nVenture a little further afield, and you'll encounter even more ethnic enclaves—Korea Town, China Town, Little Armenia—each a testament to the city's multicultural heart.\n\nIt's a city of contrasts, where close proximity can feel worlds apart. A mere ten miles can easily stretch into a two-hour journey during rush hour, a testament to the city's notorious traffic congestion.  \n\nWhile some attractions are within walking distance, the sheer size of the city makes walking a daunting proposition.  This reliance on cars has resulted in a feverish pace of life, with parking a constant battle. \n\nIronically, amidst this gridlock, new apartment buildings seem to sprout overnight, fueled by a constant influx of newcomers. Residents, however, share a sense of apprehension, wondering if the city's charm will be lost amidst the ever-growing crowds and traffic. \n\nThere's a diverse range of housing options, though.  Not everyone craves the anonymity of a high-rise.\n\nResidential areas offer a mix of houses, ranging from cozy bungalows to sprawling mansions, along with smaller apartment buildings and condominiums.  Some streets are lined with single-family homes, while others cluster together duplexes.  \n\nEven within my immediate neighborhood, there's a surprising variety of housing choices, reflecting the city's dynamic nature. \n\nThe neighborhood itself is a melting pot of ages, with many faces remaining strangers. While I cherish memories of childhood friendships and neighborhood gatherings, the modern landscape feels less intimate.",
            "My neighborhood is a curious blend of the past and present. Most of the houses are traditional single-family homes, but a few have been cleverly divided into two units while still staying connected.  My own place has a small front yard and a modest driveway. It, like many others, whispers of a bygone era when suburban life represented the quintessential American Dream. This dream, once so warmly embraced, now seems to be drifting away, yet my neighborhood, along with countless others, clings to it, whispering that the dream is still alive, though perhaps fading.\n\nThe residents, while not as optimistic as they once were, still hold onto this dream. Their yards, though not as meticulously kept, still hold the faint echo of that era. You'll see a couple of cars in most driveways, and children playing as if the world itself revolves around them.\n\nThe local public school, a landmark that has stood for almost 90 years, continues to inspire hope in the young while evoking nostalgia in the older generation. Churches are scarce, mostly empty, but the basketball courts buzz with activity. Each house may have a unique look, but they share a similar feeling, a sense of shared history.\n\nThere's a large supermarket, \"Super A,\" owned by a prominent Yemeni family, perhaps the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The majority of residents are African American. Wide streets see children playing football, their games interrupted only by passing cars.\n\nMany people here have lived here for generations, their families woven into the fabric of the community. They can tell stories of a time when everyone knew everyone.\n\nThe neighborhood has seen changes, too. The karate school, once thriving following the \"Karate Kid\" craze, has been replaced by a pharmacy - perhaps reflecting a shift in priorities. The small movie theater, screening classic films at discounted prices, struggles to attract younger crowds but remains a beloved spot for the older generation seeking a nostalgic escape.\n\nThe town is intersected by a major expressway, although its entrances and exits are located in the neighboring town. There was a time when residents tried to secure an exit for our town, but the younger generation supported it while the older generation opposed it, fearing disruption.\n\nConstruction is underway for a new high school, and the town is grappling with choosing a mascot, a symbol to represent us. Perhaps a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the perfect embodiment of our unique blend of old and new.",
            "It's easy to overlook, tucked away behind shops and a rundown supermarket, an unlikely place for a community to thrive. But venture past the desolate hotels, only bustling during fleeting family reunions, and you'll discover a vibrant world brimming with life. \n\nImagine a row of apartment buildings, nestled together like disassembled Russian nesting dolls, each story whispering tales of its own.  Some bear the scars of past controversies, their news-worthy reputations overshadowing the quiet havens nestled beside them.  Beyond those lie communities brimming with secrets, hidden from the prying eyes of the wider world.\n\nAcross the street, a community college campus hums with a sleepy energy. Students, clutching steaming coffee, stumble towards classes, their mornings a symphony of yawns and hurried steps.  Their quiet routines clash with the impatient honks of commuters, whose patience thins on days when the student influx brings traffic to a crawl. \n\nThe road branches, leading to a residential haven where a park stretches green and inviting.  A rehabilitation center, with its cheerful porch furniture and lazy ceiling fan, stands sentinel beside it, offering solace to those who've fallen.  Children revel in the park's grassy expanse, their laughter echoing as they cartwheel and twirl amidst vibrant flower patches, while retired folks stroll with their canine companions, their eyes crinkling with amusement as they observe the teenagers' antics.\n\nA strip mall, a quintessential slice of Americana, sits nearby.  A sushi restaurant, perpetually uncrowded but offering affordable delights, stands beside a swimming supply store, inviting customers to stock up for the season.  A nail salon, tucked between them, promises pampering and polish. Here, one can indulge in a manicure while indulging in hibachi chicken and planning a pool party, a testament to the convenience of a well-stocked strip mall. A frozen yogurt shop, a haven for teens, offers a sweet reprieve with its DIY concoctions, their sugary swirls often paired with skateboarding tricks and puffs of vape.\n\nThis neighborhood, a tapestry woven with threads of Americana, whispers tales of a time when life moved at a slower pace. It's a place where history lingers, and the rhythm of life unfolds with a gentle, unchanging cadence.",
            "She asked, bewildered as we passed the endless cornfields stretching across the horizon, \"Where is everything?\"  \"This is it!\" I replied, knowing she wouldn't be prepared for this vast, open landscape. Coming from a town where the grocery store was just a stone's throw away, she'd never encountered such expansiveness. Overwhelmed by the sheer number of cornfields, I shared stories of growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood who I was and where I came from.\n\nOur journey continued down a winding country road, leading us to a quarry filled with water. Just past it lay the small development where I lived.  The houses, mostly brick and stucco, each boasted at least half an acre of land, meticulously tended by their proud owners. Spring brought a riot of color with planted flowers bursting alongside the native trees, changing with every season. Gleaming Mercedes Benz luxury cars lined the driveways, their polished surfaces reflecting the midday sun after a meticulous car wash.\n\nAs we approached my own grey stucco home, our Korean neighbor, always with a friendly face, greeted us. He spent his days diligently mowing his lawn, his cheerful singing carried on the hum of his mower.  Everyone found his dedication amusing, but he was a genuine and remarkable individual with a rich past. His sharp wit had mellowed with age; he was a retired doctor, now blending in with the grass and his John Deere Zero Turn mower.\n\nFinally, we arrived at my house. Geese waddled in the side yard, chased by our energetic terrier.  A small stream flowed behind the house, feeding into the quarry.  The air hummed with the sounds of bullfrogs, the gurgling stream, and the occasional low moo from nearby farms. Across a handcrafted wooden bridge lay a secluded oasis, untouched and brimming with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was my childhood sanctuary: a place where tree forts were built, imaginary animals were hunted, and friendships blossomed.\n\nWinters in my small town could be harsh, yet undeniably beautiful. The vibrant greens of summer transformed into a barren wilderness. Trees, once adorned with colorful blossoms, stood as skeletal reminders of their past glory.  Snowfall, when it blessed us, transformed the world into a winter wonderland overnight.  Snow angels and snowmen dotted the backyard, testaments to my sister and me, who waged epic snowball wars.  We built massive igloo-like forts, armed with branches, creating our own winter fortress. In this magical realm, we lost ourselves in pretend, our childhood worries melting away. We were simply children, free and carefree.",
            "Portland, Oregon, has a unique spirit, a vibe that's captured in its unofficial motto: \"Keep Portland Weird.\"  This phrase, emblazoned on a building that somehow manages to be a pizza place, bar, music venue, and strip club all at once, speaks to a city that celebrates its eccentricities. For some, it's a nostalgic reminder of a time when Portland was less known and more affordable, a haven for creative and unconventional subcultures. For others, it's an invitation to embrace the city's quirky charm, where being a little different is not just accepted, it's celebrated.\n\nDespite the influx of wealthier residents from California and the rise of modern condos, Portland still holds onto its unique character.  \"Weird\" in Portland doesn't mean rejecting everything conventional; it means embracing the unconventional alongside the ordinary. We have our share of yoga studios, hipsters, and business professionals, just like any other city. Perhaps Portland's \"weirdness\" lies in our ability to take it all a little less seriously. \n\nIn my neighborhood, as in many others, vibrant houses line the streets, adorned with colorful gardens overflowing with flowers, herbs, and vegetables.  And then there are the \"free boxes\" that appear in the summertime – cardboard boxes (or sometimes plastic bags) filled with cast-off treasures. You never know what you might find inside – clothes, books, perhaps even a hidden gem that's perfect for someone wandering by.\n\nThis sense of possibility, of finding magic in the unexpected, is what makes Portland special for me.  Of course, Portland is a diverse city, and \"weird\" takes on many forms.  While some might shy away from a free box, others might be drawn to goat yoga or cheering on the Timbers, the city's soccer team.\n\nPortland is a place where people pursue their dreams, or at least dream about it over a few beers at their favorite bar.  Like any city, Portland faces its share of challenges – a drug problem, a homeless population that strains our resources – issues rooted in mental health and a lack of affordable housing.",
            "The mountains are a constant presence, steadfast sentinels watching over the sunrise and sunset to the north. No matter how preoccupied I get with work or life's demands, they remain, unyielding and unmoved by the world's turmoil. On days when stress threatens to overwhelm me, they beckon me to look up, offering solace and a renewed sense of strength. It was the sight of these mountains that first captured my heart when I arrived for college, their majesty surpassing even the university's own beauty, with its charming buildings, serene ponds, and vibrant trees.  While the town itself boasts its own unique charm—quaint cafes buzzing with late-night study sessions, and a downtown area steeped in history—it's the mountains that reign supreme. They stand as a constant reminder of resilience and the enduring power of nature.\n\nThis town is a fascinating blend of bustling urban energy and peaceful suburban charm.  Just a short walk from the university, downtown pulses with life, its faded brick facades lining restaurants and offices, reflecting the vibrancy of its neighboring city. But step past the library, and the serene atmosphere of a small town returns. This juxtaposition of atmospheres creates a captivating energy, inviting exploration and the creation of lasting memories. Whether it's sharing late-night laughter with friends beneath the rusty swings in the park or rushing through the lively downtown to catch a movie in the university-sponsored theater, each corner of this town holds a story.\n\nYet, like all places, it harbors both joy and sorrow. The ponds, in particular, have witnessed my share of both reflection and tears. As I've watched turtles, ducks, and insects living out their lives, each with its purpose, I've often pondered my own place in this perplexing world.  Seeking solace, I would walk past the pond, the park, and the quintessential suburban homes, until I reached a main street. There, bathed in the golden light of dawn, the palm trees stood tall against the backdrop of the mountains.  As I glanced up at the sky, I realized I was walking north, towards the enduring presence that had always been there. They stood tall, unyielding, their peaks piercing the hazy blue and yellow sky, a silent message of perseverance whispering to my soul.",
            "Venturing into Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, won't leave you lost.  New York City's famed public transportation system is readily available, making it a breeze to navigate this vibrant neighborhood.  Bensonhurst retains the energetic pulse of the city, but with a distinct cultural flavor.  Prepare to be immersed in a tapestry of Asian culture as you stroll through its streets, adorned with Asian-owned businesses at nearly every corner.  \n\nOver the past two decades, Bensonhurst has welcomed a wave of Asian residents, transforming its landscape.  Supermarkets and laundromats, beloved by both locals and newcomers, dominate the retail scene. The allure?  Exceptional quality, competitive prices, and unmatched convenience.  Just a stone's throw from my current location, four Asian supermarkets stand within a two-minute radius, a testament to the neighborhood's commitment to accessibility. \n\n While Asian culture is undeniably prominent, Bensonhurst embraces diversity in all its forms.  Immigrants and their descendants, woven into the fabric of the community, contribute to a rich and vibrant tapestry.  \n\nBeyond the bustling commercial scene lies a recently renovated park, a haven for recreation.  Ten basketball courts, a sprawling field perfect for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a children's playground, and even a refreshing water fountain for summer days, cater to a wide range of interests.  True to the spirit of New York City, the park pulsates with a kaleidoscope of cultures, where individuals from all walks of life come together in harmony.\n\nThe architectural landscape of Bensonhurst is predominantly residential.  Co-op buildings and condominiums stand alongside charming two-family houses, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere.  While the residents are generally friendly, the neighborhood is known for its lively ambiance.  \n\nBe prepared for the soundtrack of city life, with cars rumbling by, their music echoing through the streets, and the occasional revving engine that might disrupt your morning slumber.  \n\nThough generally safe, Bensonhurst is a reminder that vigilance is key in any urban environment.  Encountering individuals seeking trouble or engaging in petty theft is not unheard of.  Personal experiences with bullying and package theft have highlighted the importance of exercising caution, especially during nighttime hours.\n\nFinally, while New York City enforces regulations for pet owners, the reality in Bensonhurst is that dog waste often litters sidewalks and pathways.  A jarring sight, especially on your morning commute or grocery run.  Keep your eyes peeled and your shoes clean!",
            "Life here feels like a constant uphill climb. My house sits perched atop the steepest hill in the neighborhood, a place nicknamed the \"work out hill\" because joggers love to test their strength against its incline.  Since there are no sidewalks, everyone walks on the road, which is pockmarked and a little treacherous.  Overhead, the power lines look like a jumbled mess, patched up after countless storms that batter our area with rain and wind.  Branches and debris often bring them crashing down, leaving them looking more like a patchwork quilt than an organized network. Evergreen trees crowd the landscape, but locals seem to despise them, constantly trying to cut them down to clear the view of the ocean. That's why so many houses are built high on the hills, boasting huge, glass-fronted second stories that strain for a glimpse of the bay.\n\nThe sunsets are breathtaking, though. The water glows from below as the sky turns orange, but the sky is often shrouded in clouds, casting a haze over the sun's rays. Most days are overcast and damp, with moss clinging to everything it can: roofs, cars, railings.  I once left my car parked in the driveway for a month, and when I returned, it was covered in a thick, furry layer of moss. It took me hours to scrub it all off.  The neighborhood itself is mostly populated by retirees, with few children around.  Dogs, however, are plentiful, often seen lounging in yards or racing down the street.  They're known for their boldness, even sneaking into houses if a door or window is left open.\n\nI once found one napping in my living room and had to gently shoo it back outside. Rabbits are another common sight, though they're considered pests by gardeners because they dig up plants and burrow in lawns. My cats, however, delight in chasing them, and have successfully thinned their numbers in our area. We also have the usual assortment of birds: sparrows, hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle, until the neighborhood crows chase them away.\n\nThere aren't any shops nearby, but a short hike down to the waterfront offers a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. The beach itself is small, but the rocky shore provides a fun place to launch stones into the water. The bay is narrow enough that you can see the opposite shoreline even through the mist on most days.",
            "Life in our neighborhood is pretty typical for a small town in Tennessee. We're on a connecting street between two main roads, so there's more traffic than I'd prefer, but it's still a peaceful place. People tend to stay put here, so I've gotten to know most folks.  Days are filled with the usual routines – yard work, chores, the daily grind. When winter rolls around, the kids head down the hill on our street for some sledding fun.  \n\nOur house sits on the corner, so we're the first to see everyone coming and going. We've learned to recognize most of the cars, so when we spot something unfamiliar, it catches our attention. Some neighbors take walks to stay active or walk their dogs. Kids whiz by on bikes, just like in any other neighborhood.\n\nWe work from home, so we're around a lot. It's just the four of us: me, my wife, and our daughters, who are eleven and fourteen.  Everyone around here knows us well, and we're used to seeing them come and go too.\n\nWe love to get outside, even when it rains. We fire up the grill on our back deck from time to time, and the smell of barbecue fills the air. You can always hear the sound of lawnmowers buzzing away from March to October, when the grass finally decides to take a break.  \n\nOur neighborhood used to be a wooded area, so we have plenty of trees, which provides lots of shade. But, come fall, those leaves take over! We spend a lot of time raking and burning them, which always feels like a welcome sign that autumn is here. This year, we haven't had much of a winter, so it feels like we're stuck in a perpetual fall.  Our garage is at the back of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone comes knocking, which isn't often.  \n\nWhen I work on my truck or other projects in the garage with the doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays bring a little more hustle and bustle. Thanksgiving is a busy time with family from out of town, and cars are parked everywhere. It's the same story for Mother's Day and Christmas. \n\nAll in all, I really like living here. It would be perfect if it weren't for the through-traffic.",
            "My neighborhood sits right smack dab in the high desert, a land of endless brown dirt. Unless you've lived here, it's hard to grasp the feeling of that constant brown expanse stretching out before you.  When you do spot a lawn, you know that person's shelling out serious cash to keep it green. Back in the '90s, when I first moved here, houses were spread out like stars across the desert. Now, it's still pretty spread out, but there are a lot more houses popping up.  This place is starting to look more and more like a city every day, which is probably true for most places.  The people here are mostly friendly, though like any city, you get your share of good and bad. My neighborhood is surrounded by kind, older folks, which makes it feel pretty nice. \n\nAs for shopping, it's mostly chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final.  For anything upscale, you gotta drive a bit. I don't see many Whole Foods or similar stores around here.\n\nBased on what I see, construction seems to be the biggest industry in town. I think that's because the city is still growing and has lots of open space to build on. That does worry me a bit; I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not eager to go back. Speaking of construction, that's actually where I work – I'm a drywall and T-bar installer.\n\n\nWhat I love most about living here is the wildlife. People come to the high desert for all sorts of reasons, but the stark beauty of the desert itself is a big draw. The unique climate and landscape here have created challenging ecosystems that need protecting, and they're home to all sorts of amazing creatures.  It's important for us humans who live here to learn about the wildlife around us so we can co-exist peacefully. My family and I have adapted really well to living with the animals. My three kids are obsessed with lizards and desert bugs – right now, they're outside trying to catch some specimens.\n\nThere are a few attractions in the area, and Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert in a unique way. If you're visiting, check out the annual San Bernardino County Fair – it's a blast! And if you want to see snow-capped mountains, take a trip to nearby Wrightwood for some winter sports.\n\nIf you're interested in the history and culture of the high desert, the Victor Valley Museum is worth a visit. They have geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of Victorville's development.",
            "Describing my neighborhood is a bit unusual, I think. While others might picture houses and families, my \"neighborhood\" is the college campus I call home. My dorm building is my close-knit community, and the wider campus extends outwards, forming a larger, albeit less intimate, neighborhood. Despite this difference, my campus neighborhood shares similarities with traditional ones. Like any neighborhood, it has its own houses, people, shops, and even a park. Let's explore these \"houses\" first.\n\nThere are three main types of living spaces in my area: apartments, regular houses, and dormitory buildings. Apartments typically house 2-4 people per room, with 4-6 rooms per floor, meaning around 20 residents per building. Then there are the regular houses, rented by anyone affiliated with the school, usually alumni in 2-4 bedroom setups. These are less common, though. Finally, there are the dorm rooms, the most prevalent type, where hundreds of students live, usually two per room.\n\nMy school prides itself on diversity, and this is reflected in my neighborhood. People from all walks of life and backgrounds call this place home. The staff often live in the houses scattered around the campus, while newer students gravitate towards dorms and older students prefer apartments.\n\nDescribing the people in this neighborhood is a task in itself, as they are as diverse and unique as the houses they live in.  Perhaps it's best to move on to the stores and park that make up our little community.\n\nBeing a self-contained world, the campus boasts a variety of shops, including restaurants, the university's own clothing and grocery stores, and everything else one might need. The park serves as a common ground for everyone, kept safe and clean by the collective effort of the neighborhood.",
            "After ten years in this neighborhood, I've learned a lot. When I first moved here from Riverdale to Stockbridge, I was heartbroken. Leaving my friends and family behind was tough, but my parents believed this move to Stockbridge would be better for us – better housing, a better high school, a \"better\" life overall.  It took time to adjust, but I made new friends and some enemies at school. My only real connection with the neighbors was with Mr. Glen and his children, and Dennis for a while, since they lived right next door. They've been like family to me, and I cherish that.\n\nI'll never forget attending Mr. Glen's remarriage – it was a blast. Seeing them so happy gave me hope for my own future, for the day I can build a life with my future wife and give her the world. Watching Ms. Veda toss her garter, and me catching it! (I didn't catch the bouquet, though!), was a highlight. Dancing the night away with Marsharii, one of their daughters, was another cherished memory. I hope she's doing well.\n\nThe neighborhood is a maze, but now with GPS, I'm exploring more. I've ventured out with my friends Kason and Curtis, mainly to places where we'd play video games and soak up life. Sometimes, I find peace in the nearby park, surrounded by nature, letting it soothe my soul. I even practice my balance with sticks I bought from Home Depot and sometimes bring my bokken wooden sword for some training.\n\nThere's a basketball and tennis court, though I haven't played much lately. Still, it's there if I ever feel like dusting off those skills. My dad and my best friend were tennis fanatics, coached by Mr. Graves, and we had a blast playing under his tough but loving guidance.\n\nLooking back, there are countless fun memories from this neighborhood, but these stand out. I know the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood, a stone's throw from my college, feels like a cozy little haven.  It's a mix of apartment buildings, sprinkled with a few budget-friendly restaurants and bars that offer a lively atmosphere. One bar recently got a makeover and upped its prices, but the quality's not noticeably better, just pricier.  Mostly, the people here are friendly college students or folks making ends meet in the reasonably priced apartments. There are plenty of kids around because of the elementary school just a quick walk away. I keep to myself, though, not really knowing my neighbors. They're quite fond of marijuana, which led the building management to install an air freshener right outside their door - a comical, almost insulting, remedy. The surrounding buildings are mostly older, some with updated interiors, while down the street are brand-new apartments. But those are a no-go for me. They look cheaply built, despite the exorbitant rent. The management, capitalizing on the proximity to campus, gets away with charging a premium.\n\nThere's a ridiculously cheap eatery nearby, serving everything on paper plates and relying heavily on the microwave. Across from it, a gas station, rumored to be a dreadful place to work. But last summer, thanks to some city funding, the road got a makeover. Now, there's a wide sidewalk, lush medians, and a touch of greenery. My building, however, is tucked away under a canopy of trees. They've chopped down a few, leaving behind stumps, but there are still plenty more trees here than down the road. Behind my complex is a treeline, followed by another set of apartments. My street, 42nd, is quiet compared to 43rd right behind it. Sidewalks are crumbling, buildings look worn, and the trees seem to be hiding a less-than-pleasant truth. Most of the area's crime has stemmed from an apartment complex on 43rd, but it's not solely their fault. The complex across from me has also seen its share of trouble and a high turnover rate.\n\nDespite it all, I find myself content here. It's affordable, and I have everything I need within easy reach.  The college is a pleasant walk away, and two bus stops provide easy access to stores and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood feels like a throwback to simpler times. It's made up of duplexes scattered along a cul-de-sac, spaced out so they look like individual houses.  They all share the same cheery yellow paint, white porches, and green metal roofs, giving them a distinctive charm. Most of the folks here know each other, and you'll often find us gathered at the ends of our driveways in the evenings, chatting while the kids play. It's a welcome change from the constant digital buzz of the modern world. We're surrounded by fields and trees, with the sky often painted with blue hues and fluffy white clouds.  \n\nLife here is peaceful, but lately, we've had to contend with tornado warnings. Last night, the sirens wailed, and for the first time, we had to seek shelter. I ended up in my bathtub with my little dog, my purse, and some pillows. My big dog wasn't keen on the idea and stayed in the living room, whining nervously. The air was filled with the sound of hail pounding on the roof.  After the storm passed, the road steamed from the drastic temperature change. It was like a scene out of a movie. The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement, and as the clouds parted, a double rainbow arched across the sky. I grabbed my camera and snapped a few shots to share with friends and family.  \n\nThings quickly returned to normal, with kids back playing and moms gathering outside as dinner cooked. It's a friendly place, and I feel right at home here. I especially love the southern accents - it adds a special warmth to the atmosphere. \n\nI live in a two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment, like everyone else, but the interiors are unique. Some are surprisingly small. I enjoy taking walks in the field behind my home, down to a pond where I've seen deer and heard a giant bullfrog croaking in the mornings. It's a beautiful place to live, just a short drive from Charlotte. The mornings are filled with the sounds of roosters crowing from nearby farms. It truly feels like a small village, complete with a donkey at a nearby farm who brays in the evenings.  I feel incredibly lucky to have found this peaceful haven.",
            "I moved into this neighborhood right before starting eighth grade. Making friends was tough at first, but I eventually became close with someone just two houses down and another guy on my street. They've both moved away now, but the memories linger. Most of the original folks who lived here when I arrived are still around. It's a pretty typical American suburb – lots of two-story houses, kids playing outside every weekend when the weather's nice, and a pretty quiet atmosphere most days. I've never had any issues with the neighbors. You get a sense of privacy here unless you need something, and I've ordered plenty of packages online without any porch pirates. I feel like I can trust them. There's a park just a short walk from my house, bursting with memories. I played basketball, football, and baseball there with the neighborhood guys back in the day. I even have one pretty awful memory of getting elbowed in the nose during a football game, but the good times definitely outweigh the bad. Now, whenever I go to the park, it's to hang out with my cousin's kids. They're much younger and still love swings and slides. Just mentioning the park gets them excited, which makes me feel nostalgic for simpler times. The neighborhood itself is really diverse. You can find all kinds of cuisines within a mile radius – Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian – you name it. Though, with apps like GrubHub and DoorDash, a lot of people just have their food delivered now. Fast food chains are popular, as you'd expect in any suburb, along with plenty of pizza places.  \n\nThe stores here have everything you could need. There are multiple dry cleaners, a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is a local favorite. There's even an Indian-owned store if you're craving homemade or ready-made Indian dishes.  Overall, I really like living here. Reading about other people's neighborhood struggles online and in the news makes me appreciate mine even more.",
            "Johnston, nestled in South Carolina, is a small town that might blend in with others, yet it holds a special place in the agricultural world.  The town proudly calls itself the \"Peach Capital of the World,\" a title reflected in the vast peach orchards and sprawling cattle farms that dominate the landscape. Houses, mostly two-story structures with metal roofs or gray shingles, are scattered across the countryside, often set back from the roads to create open fields for livestock and crops. \n\nThe heart of Johnston beats around a single stoplight, marking the intersection of four roads and serving as the center for the town's small businesses.  Three \"fast food\" options cater to locals' cravings: Hong Kong, a family-run Chinese restaurant; Fiesta Mexican Restaurant; and Gary's, a local burger chain.  Gone are the days of the town's pizzeria, leaving a gap in the culinary landscape.  Maxwell and Halford Drug, a quaint family pharmacy, stands out for its unique offering - Cherry Coca-Cola.  IGA, a small but pricier grocery store, serves as the sole supermarket, but many residents venture to the larger Walmart in nearby Batesburg-Leesville for their grocery needs.  Dollar General, however, reigns supreme as the most popular spot, bustling with activity as residents stock up on everyday essentials.\n\nPossibilities Furniture & More, a beloved local furniture store run by a kind woman, offers a wide selection and even provides delivery services.  Attached is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet grooming service offering daycare, boarding, and a range of grooming options.  Both a doctor's office and a veterinary clinic, though small, provide essential healthcare services to the community.  Johnston Elementary School educates students up to fifth grade, after which they attend middle and high school in the neighboring town.\n\nWhile the town currently lacks dedicated parks, a 2.5-acre recreational area is in development, aiming to provide outdoor space for families and attract new residents.  Life in Johnston is relatively quiet, with no cinemas, bowling alleys, or bustling entertainment venues.  Despite its simplicity, it offers a peaceful charm and a strong sense of community.",
            "My journey to this place started with a podcast, one about vanished people. It was a surprise, especially since every apartment in the area cost over a thousand dollars a month.  No one I knew, not even my friends, had ever heard that story. Maybe it's the struggle, the way life can wear you down. I know some friends cry themselves to sleep at night, overwhelmed by the cost of everything. We've learned to be frugal, though, finding joy in the dusty charm of flea market treasures and secondhand clothes. There's a certain aroma that comes with adulthood, a scent of mothballs and old paperbacks, lingering even after a wash.  Here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. Starting at one end, you can visit two charity shops, a library, a rare book store, and even a curio shop. Downtown is bustling, filled with cars and people every morning, but within those thrift stores, there's a silence that's almost sacred. Outside noise fades away, and it's easy to lose yourself for an afternoon.  The city's growing, that's for sure. More cars, more people, every year. They call it a developing city, boasting a major online empire for e-commerce and delivery. It reminds me of New York, a place where everyone is focused on their own path, with little expectation of anything else. You can be alone, quiet, independent, and people won't pry. Unlike the South, where showing concern is seen as caring, here, people keep themselves to themselves. You can keep your distance, your walls up, and the city will roll on, indifferent like waves on the shore. It's a vibrant place, full of life.  With the pianist next door and the two amateur singers upstairs, there's always a soundtrack playing. We're not just strangers in an apartment building, but more like a community of friends, coming together for birthdays, funerals, and offering support when needed. I feel fortunate to be here, surrounded by kind neighbors. We look out for each other, sharing food, helping with mail, and simply enjoying each other's company.  I live in a massive, impersonal concrete jungle, but it's these connections, these neighbors, that make me feel like I haven't lost my way.",
            "This neighborhood is like a textbook example of suburbia – picture cookie-cutter houses and a homeowner's association that's always on top of things. Every house is a single-family home, all neatly kept, with a patch of grass, some decorative pebbles, and short driveways.  You'll see a lot of two-car garages, and the roads are spotless, thanks to that HOA. Most of the houses are one story, but you'll occasionally spot a two-story one adding some variety.\n\nForget those individual mailboxes you see elsewhere; here, everyone shares a big cluster of mailboxes at the end of the street, like in an apartment building.  There are even giant lockers for packages – can you guess who's behind that uniformity obsession? You got it, the HOA. \n\nMy house is on the outskirts of the city, so the neighborhood has a bit of a rural feel mixed in with the suburban.  That means there's plenty of space for things like multiple community pools, which are gated and well-maintained. There are also walking trails for those who like to stroll or walk their dogs. You don't need a park for exercise; you can just run around the neighborhood and get your steps in.\n\nMostly, the neighborhood is full of retirees, and it's a very safe place where everyone looks out for each other.  There are a few middle-aged and young professionals mixed in too. The city itself is surprisingly large but still feels like a small town with a friendly vibe.  We have everything you need, like a mall - it's not huge, but it does the trick.  A 15-minute drive takes you to all the big stores you could want, from fancy organic grocery stores to bargain outlets with just the essentials.\n\nOverall, my neighborhood is safe, tidy, and pretty typical. We have nice amenities like pools and trails, and while we're not right next to shopping, a quick drive gets you to anything you need.",
            "My town is a small Midwestern place tucked just outside the bustling suburbs of a big city. My neighborhood, on the east side, has its struggles. It's the part of town where money is tighter, with many renting or owning homes that aren't worth much. But it's not a bad place. My neighbors are friendly folks who greet me with smiles and waves. Sure, crime is a bit more common here than in other parts of town, with a few shootings and even a homicide in recent years. Sadly, our neighbors lost their son to gun violence outside a bar last year. Thankfully, we haven't been directly touched by crime beyond the occasional missing item from our porch. Like many places, our town has been hit hard by the opioid crisis. Fentanyl overdoses have taken too many lives.  But there's hope. We have great resources here, like rehab centers and Narcan training to help families facing addiction.  Despite these challenges, there's a lot to love about this town. My son's elementary school is fantastic. From the principal to the teachers and support staff, they're all wonderful. My son, who has special needs, feels safe and accepted there, and he loves going to school. Our active PTO organizes events all year round to get families involved and support learning. Because so many families struggle financially, the school provides free breakfast and lunch for every student, making sure no child goes hungry. They don't judge anyone based on their ability to pay, and they keep school fees and costs for supplies and field trips very reasonable. The city council has been working hard to spruce up town, repaving roads, planting flowers, and fixing up parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have been focused on the central area and the west side, where most of the shops and traffic are. The east side, where I live, seems to be forgotten, which is frustrating for those of us who live here.  All things considered, I'm happy living in this town.  People are friendly, the schools are great, we have plenty of shopping options, and while our home might not be worth much, it's comfortable and it's ours.  We've lived here for over 16 years, and we can't imagine being anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood pulsates with a vibrant culture, nestled upon a hilltop adorned with buildings steeped in history. I reside in a seven-story apartment building directly across from a historic theater, and just a short distance away, a quirky arcade bar beckons diverse crowds on warm summer evenings, often brimming with lines of eager patrons, especially during those languid June and July weekends.  A short stroll takes me to the nearest city park, a sprawling green oasis amidst the urban landscape. Surrounding it is a concrete perimeter, punctuated by towering staircases embedded in the wall. During the harsh winter months, when icy winds bite and the rain falls in relentless sheets, a community of individuals experiencing homelessness find refuge in neat rows of tents, strategically positioned along the sidewalks and steps.  Their proximity to each other, and the heart of the city, provides a measure of warmth and accessibility to essential resources like the nearby family center, offering a sanctuary for showers and meals. \n\nYet, my affection for this city transcends its historic grandeur - the towering edifices, the intricate architecture that adorns the undulating hills leading down to the ocean. My heart is captivated by the spirit of its people.  Hilltop, once notorious for gang violence on the West Coast, still echoes with tales of the government's relentless pursuit to eradicate the issue. These stories, passed down through generations, serve as a constant reminder of the neighborhood's past struggles. Despite its reputation as one of the city's rougher areas, the residents persevere, diligently tending to their community, their spirits unbroken.  Warnings against venturing out alone at night, particularly for those who are not from the neighborhood, linger - echoes of a bygone era. Perhaps it is my own complexion, allowing me to blend in, or maybe Hilltop recognizes a kindred spirit in me, someone who shares a deep understanding of the insidious nature of societal prejudice and assumptions that plague our nation. Regardless, I feel an undeniable connection to this place.\n\nHilltop is home.  Walking its streets at night, I am enveloped by a sense of belonging.  I have been offered warmth and kindness by strangers, their generosity outweighing any fear.  It is a place where a laundromat owner extended their closing time to let me charge my phone during a torrential downpour, a place where, on a particularly bleak night, a stranger saw me huddled in the shadows and offered me not just five dollars, but a look of genuine connection, affirming my worth and beauty.",
            "I call a slice of Rural America home, specifically a small town in Michigan. Imagine a world where farmland seamlessly blends into quaint tourist spots, but forget the hustle and bustle of big city life – no sprawling malls, no chain stores like Walmart or Target, not even the familiar red neon of an Applebee's.  Getting around means a car is your constant companion.  \n\nYet, here I live in one of the most breathtaking places on Earth, surrounded by water. My town is cradled by the beauty of Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix, with beaches beckoning from every corner.\n\nOur neighborhood embodies the spirit of small-town charm. Houses aren't huddled together like sardines, each one a unique story etched in brick and wood. Some have been lovingly updated, while others wear their age proudly.  Most boast full basements, visible from the street, and many sport classic aluminum siding in a rainbow of colors. \n\nFront yards are a common sight, bursting with life: trampolines bouncing, playsets clamoring, gardens bursting with blooms, and fences guarding furry friends.  It's a picture of Middle America: hardworking families raising children, creating memories, and forging a sense of community. \n\nKids chase each other down sidewalks, dogs get their daily exercise, and neighbors greet each other with waves and smiles. Lawns are manicured, reflecting a quiet pride in their surroundings. There's no extravagant display of wealth here, but a simple, genuine warmth that speaks volumes. \n\nThis isn't a neighborhood that shouts its beauty; it whispers it. It's a place where you can picture raising a family, where kids can play freely, and where the air is thick with the promise of peace.\n\nJust a stone's throw away, you'll find the sheriff's department and jail, the health department, and the recycling center, all symbols of community responsibility. The sound of cheers from nearby baseball and softball fields mixes with the rumble of small planes taking off and landing at the nearby airport.  Even a craving for ice cream can be satisfied with a short walk, and for those who dare, a bike ride can take you to the heart of town. \n\nIt's a simple life, but a good one. It's a place where I can truly feel at home."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "City life is a whirlwind of contrasts. My neighborhood is a vibrant tapestry woven from bustling commercial hubs and quieter residential pockets. It's a kaleidoscope of experiences, with towering office buildings standing shoulder-to-shoulder with quirky boutiques and tempting restaurants.  Everywhere you turn, there's something new to discover, whether it's a trendy eatery, a hidden gem of a store, or a lively entertainment venue.  \n\nWhile giant corporations cast long shadows over the landscape, independent shops are finding their footing, adding a touch of individuality to the urban fabric. They're scattered throughout the city, popping up in bustling malls and lining the streets, often within easy walking distance of serene residential areas. \n\nParks offer a welcome respite from the city's energy, filled with families enjoying carefree moments with their children.  \n\nPeople from all walks of life call this neighborhood home.  Right here, you'll find a vibrant LGBTQ+ community, a devout Orthodox Jewish enclave, and a diverse mix of immigrants, many hailing from the former Soviet Union.\n\nVenture a little further afield, and you'll encounter even more ethnic enclaves—Korea Town, China Town, Little Armenia—each a testament to the city's multicultural heart.\n\nIt's a city of contrasts, where close proximity can feel worlds apart. A mere ten miles can easily stretch into a two-hour journey during rush hour, a testament to the city's notorious traffic congestion.  \n\nWhile some attractions are within walking distance, the sheer size of the city makes walking a daunting proposition.  This reliance on cars has resulted in a feverish pace of life, with parking a constant battle. \n\nIronically, amidst this gridlock, new apartment buildings seem to sprout overnight, fueled by a constant influx of newcomers. Residents, however, share a sense of apprehension, wondering if the city's charm will be lost amidst the ever-growing crowds and traffic. \n\nThere's a diverse range of housing options, though.  Not everyone craves the anonymity of a high-rise.\n\nResidential areas offer a mix of houses, ranging from cozy bungalows to sprawling mansions, along with smaller apartment buildings and condominiums.  Some streets are lined with single-family homes, while others cluster together duplexes.  \n\nEven within my immediate neighborhood, there's a surprising variety of housing choices, reflecting the city's dynamic nature. \n\nThe neighborhood itself is a melting pot of ages, with many faces remaining strangers. While I cherish memories of childhood friendships and neighborhood gatherings, the modern landscape feels less intimate.",
            "My neighborhood is a curious blend of the past and present. Most of the houses are traditional single-family homes, but a few have been cleverly divided into two units while still staying connected.  My own place has a small front yard and a modest driveway. It, like many others, whispers of a bygone era when suburban life represented the quintessential American Dream. This dream, once so warmly embraced, now seems to be drifting away, yet my neighborhood, along with countless others, clings to it, whispering that the dream is still alive, though perhaps fading.\n\nThe residents, while not as optimistic as they once were, still hold onto this dream. Their yards, though not as meticulously kept, still hold the faint echo of that era. You'll see a couple of cars in most driveways, and children playing as if the world itself revolves around them.\n\nThe local public school, a landmark that has stood for almost 90 years, continues to inspire hope in the young while evoking nostalgia in the older generation. Churches are scarce, mostly empty, but the basketball courts buzz with activity. Each house may have a unique look, but they share a similar feeling, a sense of shared history.\n\nThere's a large supermarket, \"Super A,\" owned by a prominent Yemeni family, perhaps the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The majority of residents are African American. Wide streets see children playing football, their games interrupted only by passing cars.\n\nMany people here have lived here for generations, their families woven into the fabric of the community. They can tell stories of a time when everyone knew everyone.\n\nThe neighborhood has seen changes, too. The karate school, once thriving following the \"Karate Kid\" craze, has been replaced by a pharmacy - perhaps reflecting a shift in priorities. The small movie theater, screening classic films at discounted prices, struggles to attract younger crowds but remains a beloved spot for the older generation seeking a nostalgic escape.\n\nThe town is intersected by a major expressway, although its entrances and exits are located in the neighboring town. There was a time when residents tried to secure an exit for our town, but the younger generation supported it while the older generation opposed it, fearing disruption.\n\nConstruction is underway for a new high school, and the town is grappling with choosing a mascot, a symbol to represent us. Perhaps a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the perfect embodiment of our unique blend of old and new.",
            "It's easy to overlook, tucked away behind shops and a rundown supermarket, an unlikely place for a community to thrive. But venture past the desolate hotels, only bustling during fleeting family reunions, and you'll discover a vibrant world brimming with life. \n\nImagine a row of apartment buildings, nestled together like disassembled Russian nesting dolls, each story whispering tales of its own.  Some bear the scars of past controversies, their news-worthy reputations overshadowing the quiet havens nestled beside them.  Beyond those lie communities brimming with secrets, hidden from the prying eyes of the wider world.\n\nAcross the street, a community college campus hums with a sleepy energy. Students, clutching steaming coffee, stumble towards classes, their mornings a symphony of yawns and hurried steps.  Their quiet routines clash with the impatient honks of commuters, whose patience thins on days when the student influx brings traffic to a crawl. \n\nThe road branches, leading to a residential haven where a park stretches green and inviting.  A rehabilitation center, with its cheerful porch furniture and lazy ceiling fan, stands sentinel beside it, offering solace to those who've fallen.  Children revel in the park's grassy expanse, their laughter echoing as they cartwheel and twirl amidst vibrant flower patches, while retired folks stroll with their canine companions, their eyes crinkling with amusement as they observe the teenagers' antics.\n\nA strip mall, a quintessential slice of Americana, sits nearby.  A sushi restaurant, perpetually uncrowded but offering affordable delights, stands beside a swimming supply store, inviting customers to stock up for the season.  A nail salon, tucked between them, promises pampering and polish. Here, one can indulge in a manicure while indulging in hibachi chicken and planning a pool party, a testament to the convenience of a well-stocked strip mall. A frozen yogurt shop, a haven for teens, offers a sweet reprieve with its DIY concoctions, their sugary swirls often paired with skateboarding tricks and puffs of vape.\n\nThis neighborhood, a tapestry woven with threads of Americana, whispers tales of a time when life moved at a slower pace. It's a place where history lingers, and the rhythm of life unfolds with a gentle, unchanging cadence.",
            "She asked, bewildered as we passed the endless cornfields stretching across the horizon, \"Where is everything?\"  \"This is it!\" I replied, knowing she wouldn't be prepared for this vast, open landscape. Coming from a town where the grocery store was just a stone's throw away, she'd never encountered such expansiveness. Overwhelmed by the sheer number of cornfields, I shared stories of growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood who I was and where I came from.\n\nOur journey continued down a winding country road, leading us to a quarry filled with water. Just past it lay the small development where I lived.  The houses, mostly brick and stucco, each boasted at least half an acre of land, meticulously tended by their proud owners. Spring brought a riot of color with planted flowers bursting alongside the native trees, changing with every season. Gleaming Mercedes Benz luxury cars lined the driveways, their polished surfaces reflecting the midday sun after a meticulous car wash.\n\nAs we approached my own grey stucco home, our Korean neighbor, always with a friendly face, greeted us. He spent his days diligently mowing his lawn, his cheerful singing carried on the hum of his mower.  Everyone found his dedication amusing, but he was a genuine and remarkable individual with a rich past. His sharp wit had mellowed with age; he was a retired doctor, now blending in with the grass and his John Deere Zero Turn mower.\n\nFinally, we arrived at my house. Geese waddled in the side yard, chased by our energetic terrier.  A small stream flowed behind the house, feeding into the quarry.  The air hummed with the sounds of bullfrogs, the gurgling stream, and the occasional low moo from nearby farms. Across a handcrafted wooden bridge lay a secluded oasis, untouched and brimming with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was my childhood sanctuary: a place where tree forts were built, imaginary animals were hunted, and friendships blossomed.\n\nWinters in my small town could be harsh, yet undeniably beautiful. The vibrant greens of summer transformed into a barren wilderness. Trees, once adorned with colorful blossoms, stood as skeletal reminders of their past glory.  Snowfall, when it blessed us, transformed the world into a winter wonderland overnight.  Snow angels and snowmen dotted the backyard, testaments to my sister and me, who waged epic snowball wars.  We built massive igloo-like forts, armed with branches, creating our own winter fortress. In this magical realm, we lost ourselves in pretend, our childhood worries melting away. We were simply children, free and carefree.",
            "Portland, Oregon, has a unique spirit, a vibe that's captured in its unofficial motto: \"Keep Portland Weird.\"  This phrase, emblazoned on a building that somehow manages to be a pizza place, bar, music venue, and strip club all at once, speaks to a city that celebrates its eccentricities. For some, it's a nostalgic reminder of a time when Portland was less known and more affordable, a haven for creative and unconventional subcultures. For others, it's an invitation to embrace the city's quirky charm, where being a little different is not just accepted, it's celebrated.\n\nDespite the influx of wealthier residents from California and the rise of modern condos, Portland still holds onto its unique character.  \"Weird\" in Portland doesn't mean rejecting everything conventional; it means embracing the unconventional alongside the ordinary. We have our share of yoga studios, hipsters, and business professionals, just like any other city. Perhaps Portland's \"weirdness\" lies in our ability to take it all a little less seriously. \n\nIn my neighborhood, as in many others, vibrant houses line the streets, adorned with colorful gardens overflowing with flowers, herbs, and vegetables.  And then there are the \"free boxes\" that appear in the summertime – cardboard boxes (or sometimes plastic bags) filled with cast-off treasures. You never know what you might find inside – clothes, books, perhaps even a hidden gem that's perfect for someone wandering by.\n\nThis sense of possibility, of finding magic in the unexpected, is what makes Portland special for me.  Of course, Portland is a diverse city, and \"weird\" takes on many forms.  While some might shy away from a free box, others might be drawn to goat yoga or cheering on the Timbers, the city's soccer team.\n\nPortland is a place where people pursue their dreams, or at least dream about it over a few beers at their favorite bar.  Like any city, Portland faces its share of challenges – a drug problem, a homeless population that strains our resources – issues rooted in mental health and a lack of affordable housing.",
            "The mountains are a constant presence, steadfast sentinels watching over the sunrise and sunset to the north. No matter how preoccupied I get with work or life's demands, they remain, unyielding and unmoved by the world's turmoil. On days when stress threatens to overwhelm me, they beckon me to look up, offering solace and a renewed sense of strength. It was the sight of these mountains that first captured my heart when I arrived for college, their majesty surpassing even the university's own beauty, with its charming buildings, serene ponds, and vibrant trees.  While the town itself boasts its own unique charm—quaint cafes buzzing with late-night study sessions, and a downtown area steeped in history—it's the mountains that reign supreme. They stand as a constant reminder of resilience and the enduring power of nature.\n\nThis town is a fascinating blend of bustling urban energy and peaceful suburban charm.  Just a short walk from the university, downtown pulses with life, its faded brick facades lining restaurants and offices, reflecting the vibrancy of its neighboring city. But step past the library, and the serene atmosphere of a small town returns. This juxtaposition of atmospheres creates a captivating energy, inviting exploration and the creation of lasting memories. Whether it's sharing late-night laughter with friends beneath the rusty swings in the park or rushing through the lively downtown to catch a movie in the university-sponsored theater, each corner of this town holds a story.\n\nYet, like all places, it harbors both joy and sorrow. The ponds, in particular, have witnessed my share of both reflection and tears. As I've watched turtles, ducks, and insects living out their lives, each with its purpose, I've often pondered my own place in this perplexing world.  Seeking solace, I would walk past the pond, the park, and the quintessential suburban homes, until I reached a main street. There, bathed in the golden light of dawn, the palm trees stood tall against the backdrop of the mountains.  As I glanced up at the sky, I realized I was walking north, towards the enduring presence that had always been there. They stood tall, unyielding, their peaks piercing the hazy blue and yellow sky, a silent message of perseverance whispering to my soul.",
            "Venturing into Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, won't leave you lost.  New York City's famed public transportation system is readily available, making it a breeze to navigate this vibrant neighborhood.  Bensonhurst retains the energetic pulse of the city, but with a distinct cultural flavor.  Prepare to be immersed in a tapestry of Asian culture as you stroll through its streets, adorned with Asian-owned businesses at nearly every corner.  \n\nOver the past two decades, Bensonhurst has welcomed a wave of Asian residents, transforming its landscape.  Supermarkets and laundromats, beloved by both locals and newcomers, dominate the retail scene. The allure?  Exceptional quality, competitive prices, and unmatched convenience.  Just a stone's throw from my current location, four Asian supermarkets stand within a two-minute radius, a testament to the neighborhood's commitment to accessibility. \n\n While Asian culture is undeniably prominent, Bensonhurst embraces diversity in all its forms.  Immigrants and their descendants, woven into the fabric of the community, contribute to a rich and vibrant tapestry.  \n\nBeyond the bustling commercial scene lies a recently renovated park, a haven for recreation.  Ten basketball courts, a sprawling field perfect for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a children's playground, and even a refreshing water fountain for summer days, cater to a wide range of interests.  True to the spirit of New York City, the park pulsates with a kaleidoscope of cultures, where individuals from all walks of life come together in harmony.\n\nThe architectural landscape of Bensonhurst is predominantly residential.  Co-op buildings and condominiums stand alongside charming two-family houses, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere.  While the residents are generally friendly, the neighborhood is known for its lively ambiance.  \n\nBe prepared for the soundtrack of city life, with cars rumbling by, their music echoing through the streets, and the occasional revving engine that might disrupt your morning slumber.  \n\nThough generally safe, Bensonhurst is a reminder that vigilance is key in any urban environment.  Encountering individuals seeking trouble or engaging in petty theft is not unheard of.  Personal experiences with bullying and package theft have highlighted the importance of exercising caution, especially during nighttime hours.\n\nFinally, while New York City enforces regulations for pet owners, the reality in Bensonhurst is that dog waste often litters sidewalks and pathways.  A jarring sight, especially on your morning commute or grocery run.  Keep your eyes peeled and your shoes clean!",
            "Life here feels like a constant uphill climb. My house sits perched atop the steepest hill in the neighborhood, a place nicknamed the \"work out hill\" because joggers love to test their strength against its incline.  Since there are no sidewalks, everyone walks on the road, which is pockmarked and a little treacherous.  Overhead, the power lines look like a jumbled mess, patched up after countless storms that batter our area with rain and wind.  Branches and debris often bring them crashing down, leaving them looking more like a patchwork quilt than an organized network. Evergreen trees crowd the landscape, but locals seem to despise them, constantly trying to cut them down to clear the view of the ocean. That's why so many houses are built high on the hills, boasting huge, glass-fronted second stories that strain for a glimpse of the bay.\n\nThe sunsets are breathtaking, though. The water glows from below as the sky turns orange, but the sky is often shrouded in clouds, casting a haze over the sun's rays. Most days are overcast and damp, with moss clinging to everything it can: roofs, cars, railings.  I once left my car parked in the driveway for a month, and when I returned, it was covered in a thick, furry layer of moss. It took me hours to scrub it all off.  The neighborhood itself is mostly populated by retirees, with few children around.  Dogs, however, are plentiful, often seen lounging in yards or racing down the street.  They're known for their boldness, even sneaking into houses if a door or window is left open.\n\nI once found one napping in my living room and had to gently shoo it back outside. Rabbits are another common sight, though they're considered pests by gardeners because they dig up plants and burrow in lawns. My cats, however, delight in chasing them, and have successfully thinned their numbers in our area. We also have the usual assortment of birds: sparrows, hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle, until the neighborhood crows chase them away.\n\nThere aren't any shops nearby, but a short hike down to the waterfront offers a few restaurants serving fresh seafood. The beach itself is small, but the rocky shore provides a fun place to launch stones into the water. The bay is narrow enough that you can see the opposite shoreline even through the mist on most days.",
            "Life in our neighborhood is pretty typical for a small town in Tennessee. We're on a connecting street between two main roads, so there's more traffic than I'd prefer, but it's still a peaceful place. People tend to stay put here, so I've gotten to know most folks.  Days are filled with the usual routines – yard work, chores, the daily grind. When winter rolls around, the kids head down the hill on our street for some sledding fun.  \n\nOur house sits on the corner, so we're the first to see everyone coming and going. We've learned to recognize most of the cars, so when we spot something unfamiliar, it catches our attention. Some neighbors take walks to stay active or walk their dogs. Kids whiz by on bikes, just like in any other neighborhood.\n\nWe work from home, so we're around a lot. It's just the four of us: me, my wife, and our daughters, who are eleven and fourteen.  Everyone around here knows us well, and we're used to seeing them come and go too.\n\nWe love to get outside, even when it rains. We fire up the grill on our back deck from time to time, and the smell of barbecue fills the air. You can always hear the sound of lawnmowers buzzing away from March to October, when the grass finally decides to take a break.  \n\nOur neighborhood used to be a wooded area, so we have plenty of trees, which provides lots of shade. But, come fall, those leaves take over! We spend a lot of time raking and burning them, which always feels like a welcome sign that autumn is here. This year, we haven't had much of a winter, so it feels like we're stuck in a perpetual fall.  Our garage is at the back of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone comes knocking, which isn't often.  \n\nWhen I work on my truck or other projects in the garage with the doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays bring a little more hustle and bustle. Thanksgiving is a busy time with family from out of town, and cars are parked everywhere. It's the same story for Mother's Day and Christmas. \n\nAll in all, I really like living here. It would be perfect if it weren't for the through-traffic.",
            "My neighborhood sits right smack dab in the high desert, a land of endless brown dirt. Unless you've lived here, it's hard to grasp the feeling of that constant brown expanse stretching out before you.  When you do spot a lawn, you know that person's shelling out serious cash to keep it green. Back in the '90s, when I first moved here, houses were spread out like stars across the desert. Now, it's still pretty spread out, but there are a lot more houses popping up.  This place is starting to look more and more like a city every day, which is probably true for most places.  The people here are mostly friendly, though like any city, you get your share of good and bad. My neighborhood is surrounded by kind, older folks, which makes it feel pretty nice. \n\nAs for shopping, it's mostly chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final.  For anything upscale, you gotta drive a bit. I don't see many Whole Foods or similar stores around here.\n\nBased on what I see, construction seems to be the biggest industry in town. I think that's because the city is still growing and has lots of open space to build on. That does worry me a bit; I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not eager to go back. Speaking of construction, that's actually where I work – I'm a drywall and T-bar installer.\n\n\nWhat I love most about living here is the wildlife. People come to the high desert for all sorts of reasons, but the stark beauty of the desert itself is a big draw. The unique climate and landscape here have created challenging ecosystems that need protecting, and they're home to all sorts of amazing creatures.  It's important for us humans who live here to learn about the wildlife around us so we can co-exist peacefully. My family and I have adapted really well to living with the animals. My three kids are obsessed with lizards and desert bugs – right now, they're outside trying to catch some specimens.\n\nThere are a few attractions in the area, and Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert in a unique way. If you're visiting, check out the annual San Bernardino County Fair – it's a blast! And if you want to see snow-capped mountains, take a trip to nearby Wrightwood for some winter sports.\n\nIf you're interested in the history and culture of the high desert, the Victor Valley Museum is worth a visit. They have geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of Victorville's development.",
            "Describing my neighborhood is a bit unusual, I think. While others might picture houses and families, my \"neighborhood\" is the college campus I call home. My dorm building is my close-knit community, and the wider campus extends outwards, forming a larger, albeit less intimate, neighborhood. Despite this difference, my campus neighborhood shares similarities with traditional ones. Like any neighborhood, it has its own houses, people, shops, and even a park. Let's explore these \"houses\" first.\n\nThere are three main types of living spaces in my area: apartments, regular houses, and dormitory buildings. Apartments typically house 2-4 people per room, with 4-6 rooms per floor, meaning around 20 residents per building. Then there are the regular houses, rented by anyone affiliated with the school, usually alumni in 2-4 bedroom setups. These are less common, though. Finally, there are the dorm rooms, the most prevalent type, where hundreds of students live, usually two per room.\n\nMy school prides itself on diversity, and this is reflected in my neighborhood. People from all walks of life and backgrounds call this place home. The staff often live in the houses scattered around the campus, while newer students gravitate towards dorms and older students prefer apartments.\n\nDescribing the people in this neighborhood is a task in itself, as they are as diverse and unique as the houses they live in.  Perhaps it's best to move on to the stores and park that make up our little community.\n\nBeing a self-contained world, the campus boasts a variety of shops, including restaurants, the university's own clothing and grocery stores, and everything else one might need. The park serves as a common ground for everyone, kept safe and clean by the collective effort of the neighborhood.",
            "After ten years in this neighborhood, I've learned a lot. When I first moved here from Riverdale to Stockbridge, I was heartbroken. Leaving my friends and family behind was tough, but my parents believed this move to Stockbridge would be better for us – better housing, a better high school, a \"better\" life overall.  It took time to adjust, but I made new friends and some enemies at school. My only real connection with the neighbors was with Mr. Glen and his children, and Dennis for a while, since they lived right next door. They've been like family to me, and I cherish that.\n\nI'll never forget attending Mr. Glen's remarriage – it was a blast. Seeing them so happy gave me hope for my own future, for the day I can build a life with my future wife and give her the world. Watching Ms. Veda toss her garter, and me catching it! (I didn't catch the bouquet, though!), was a highlight. Dancing the night away with Marsharii, one of their daughters, was another cherished memory. I hope she's doing well.\n\nThe neighborhood is a maze, but now with GPS, I'm exploring more. I've ventured out with my friends Kason and Curtis, mainly to places where we'd play video games and soak up life. Sometimes, I find peace in the nearby park, surrounded by nature, letting it soothe my soul. I even practice my balance with sticks I bought from Home Depot and sometimes bring my bokken wooden sword for some training.\n\nThere's a basketball and tennis court, though I haven't played much lately. Still, it's there if I ever feel like dusting off those skills. My dad and my best friend were tennis fanatics, coached by Mr. Graves, and we had a blast playing under his tough but loving guidance.\n\nLooking back, there are countless fun memories from this neighborhood, but these stand out. I know the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood, a stone's throw from my college, feels like a cozy little haven.  It's a mix of apartment buildings, sprinkled with a few budget-friendly restaurants and bars that offer a lively atmosphere. One bar recently got a makeover and upped its prices, but the quality's not noticeably better, just pricier.  Mostly, the people here are friendly college students or folks making ends meet in the reasonably priced apartments. There are plenty of kids around because of the elementary school just a quick walk away. I keep to myself, though, not really knowing my neighbors. They're quite fond of marijuana, which led the building management to install an air freshener right outside their door - a comical, almost insulting, remedy. The surrounding buildings are mostly older, some with updated interiors, while down the street are brand-new apartments. But those are a no-go for me. They look cheaply built, despite the exorbitant rent. The management, capitalizing on the proximity to campus, gets away with charging a premium.\n\nThere's a ridiculously cheap eatery nearby, serving everything on paper plates and relying heavily on the microwave. Across from it, a gas station, rumored to be a dreadful place to work. But last summer, thanks to some city funding, the road got a makeover. Now, there's a wide sidewalk, lush medians, and a touch of greenery. My building, however, is tucked away under a canopy of trees. They've chopped down a few, leaving behind stumps, but there are still plenty more trees here than down the road. Behind my complex is a treeline, followed by another set of apartments. My street, 42nd, is quiet compared to 43rd right behind it. Sidewalks are crumbling, buildings look worn, and the trees seem to be hiding a less-than-pleasant truth. Most of the area's crime has stemmed from an apartment complex on 43rd, but it's not solely their fault. The complex across from me has also seen its share of trouble and a high turnover rate.\n\nDespite it all, I find myself content here. It's affordable, and I have everything I need within easy reach.  The college is a pleasant walk away, and two bus stops provide easy access to stores and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood feels like a throwback to simpler times. It's made up of duplexes scattered along a cul-de-sac, spaced out so they look like individual houses.  They all share the same cheery yellow paint, white porches, and green metal roofs, giving them a distinctive charm. Most of the folks here know each other, and you'll often find us gathered at the ends of our driveways in the evenings, chatting while the kids play. It's a welcome change from the constant digital buzz of the modern world. We're surrounded by fields and trees, with the sky often painted with blue hues and fluffy white clouds.  \n\nLife here is peaceful, but lately, we've had to contend with tornado warnings. Last night, the sirens wailed, and for the first time, we had to seek shelter. I ended up in my bathtub with my little dog, my purse, and some pillows. My big dog wasn't keen on the idea and stayed in the living room, whining nervously. The air was filled with the sound of hail pounding on the roof.  After the storm passed, the road steamed from the drastic temperature change. It was like a scene out of a movie. The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement, and as the clouds parted, a double rainbow arched across the sky. I grabbed my camera and snapped a few shots to share with friends and family.  \n\nThings quickly returned to normal, with kids back playing and moms gathering outside as dinner cooked. It's a friendly place, and I feel right at home here. I especially love the southern accents - it adds a special warmth to the atmosphere. \n\nI live in a two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment, like everyone else, but the interiors are unique. Some are surprisingly small. I enjoy taking walks in the field behind my home, down to a pond where I've seen deer and heard a giant bullfrog croaking in the mornings. It's a beautiful place to live, just a short drive from Charlotte. The mornings are filled with the sounds of roosters crowing from nearby farms. It truly feels like a small village, complete with a donkey at a nearby farm who brays in the evenings.  I feel incredibly lucky to have found this peaceful haven.",
            "I moved into this neighborhood right before starting eighth grade. Making friends was tough at first, but I eventually became close with someone just two houses down and another guy on my street. They've both moved away now, but the memories linger. Most of the original folks who lived here when I arrived are still around. It's a pretty typical American suburb – lots of two-story houses, kids playing outside every weekend when the weather's nice, and a pretty quiet atmosphere most days. I've never had any issues with the neighbors. You get a sense of privacy here unless you need something, and I've ordered plenty of packages online without any porch pirates. I feel like I can trust them. There's a park just a short walk from my house, bursting with memories. I played basketball, football, and baseball there with the neighborhood guys back in the day. I even have one pretty awful memory of getting elbowed in the nose during a football game, but the good times definitely outweigh the bad. Now, whenever I go to the park, it's to hang out with my cousin's kids. They're much younger and still love swings and slides. Just mentioning the park gets them excited, which makes me feel nostalgic for simpler times. The neighborhood itself is really diverse. You can find all kinds of cuisines within a mile radius – Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian – you name it. Though, with apps like GrubHub and DoorDash, a lot of people just have their food delivered now. Fast food chains are popular, as you'd expect in any suburb, along with plenty of pizza places.  \n\nThe stores here have everything you could need. There are multiple dry cleaners, a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is a local favorite. There's even an Indian-owned store if you're craving homemade or ready-made Indian dishes.  Overall, I really like living here. Reading about other people's neighborhood struggles online and in the news makes me appreciate mine even more.",
            "Johnston, nestled in South Carolina, is a small town that might blend in with others, yet it holds a special place in the agricultural world.  The town proudly calls itself the \"Peach Capital of the World,\" a title reflected in the vast peach orchards and sprawling cattle farms that dominate the landscape. Houses, mostly two-story structures with metal roofs or gray shingles, are scattered across the countryside, often set back from the roads to create open fields for livestock and crops. \n\nThe heart of Johnston beats around a single stoplight, marking the intersection of four roads and serving as the center for the town's small businesses.  Three \"fast food\" options cater to locals' cravings: Hong Kong, a family-run Chinese restaurant; Fiesta Mexican Restaurant; and Gary's, a local burger chain.  Gone are the days of the town's pizzeria, leaving a gap in the culinary landscape.  Maxwell and Halford Drug, a quaint family pharmacy, stands out for its unique offering - Cherry Coca-Cola.  IGA, a small but pricier grocery store, serves as the sole supermarket, but many residents venture to the larger Walmart in nearby Batesburg-Leesville for their grocery needs.  Dollar General, however, reigns supreme as the most popular spot, bustling with activity as residents stock up on everyday essentials.\n\nPossibilities Furniture & More, a beloved local furniture store run by a kind woman, offers a wide selection and even provides delivery services.  Attached is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet grooming service offering daycare, boarding, and a range of grooming options.  Both a doctor's office and a veterinary clinic, though small, provide essential healthcare services to the community.  Johnston Elementary School educates students up to fifth grade, after which they attend middle and high school in the neighboring town.\n\nWhile the town currently lacks dedicated parks, a 2.5-acre recreational area is in development, aiming to provide outdoor space for families and attract new residents.  Life in Johnston is relatively quiet, with no cinemas, bowling alleys, or bustling entertainment venues.  Despite its simplicity, it offers a peaceful charm and a strong sense of community.",
            "My journey to this place started with a podcast, one about vanished people. It was a surprise, especially since every apartment in the area cost over a thousand dollars a month.  No one I knew, not even my friends, had ever heard that story. Maybe it's the struggle, the way life can wear you down. I know some friends cry themselves to sleep at night, overwhelmed by the cost of everything. We've learned to be frugal, though, finding joy in the dusty charm of flea market treasures and secondhand clothes. There's a certain aroma that comes with adulthood, a scent of mothballs and old paperbacks, lingering even after a wash.  Here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. Starting at one end, you can visit two charity shops, a library, a rare book store, and even a curio shop. Downtown is bustling, filled with cars and people every morning, but within those thrift stores, there's a silence that's almost sacred. Outside noise fades away, and it's easy to lose yourself for an afternoon.  The city's growing, that's for sure. More cars, more people, every year. They call it a developing city, boasting a major online empire for e-commerce and delivery. It reminds me of New York, a place where everyone is focused on their own path, with little expectation of anything else. You can be alone, quiet, independent, and people won't pry. Unlike the South, where showing concern is seen as caring, here, people keep themselves to themselves. You can keep your distance, your walls up, and the city will roll on, indifferent like waves on the shore. It's a vibrant place, full of life.  With the pianist next door and the two amateur singers upstairs, there's always a soundtrack playing. We're not just strangers in an apartment building, but more like a community of friends, coming together for birthdays, funerals, and offering support when needed. I feel fortunate to be here, surrounded by kind neighbors. We look out for each other, sharing food, helping with mail, and simply enjoying each other's company.  I live in a massive, impersonal concrete jungle, but it's these connections, these neighbors, that make me feel like I haven't lost my way.",
            "This neighborhood is like a textbook example of suburbia – picture cookie-cutter houses and a homeowner's association that's always on top of things. Every house is a single-family home, all neatly kept, with a patch of grass, some decorative pebbles, and short driveways.  You'll see a lot of two-car garages, and the roads are spotless, thanks to that HOA. Most of the houses are one story, but you'll occasionally spot a two-story one adding some variety.\n\nForget those individual mailboxes you see elsewhere; here, everyone shares a big cluster of mailboxes at the end of the street, like in an apartment building.  There are even giant lockers for packages – can you guess who's behind that uniformity obsession? You got it, the HOA. \n\nMy house is on the outskirts of the city, so the neighborhood has a bit of a rural feel mixed in with the suburban.  That means there's plenty of space for things like multiple community pools, which are gated and well-maintained. There are also walking trails for those who like to stroll or walk their dogs. You don't need a park for exercise; you can just run around the neighborhood and get your steps in.\n\nMostly, the neighborhood is full of retirees, and it's a very safe place where everyone looks out for each other.  There are a few middle-aged and young professionals mixed in too. The city itself is surprisingly large but still feels like a small town with a friendly vibe.  We have everything you need, like a mall - it's not huge, but it does the trick.  A 15-minute drive takes you to all the big stores you could want, from fancy organic grocery stores to bargain outlets with just the essentials.\n\nOverall, my neighborhood is safe, tidy, and pretty typical. We have nice amenities like pools and trails, and while we're not right next to shopping, a quick drive gets you to anything you need.",
            "My town is a small Midwestern place tucked just outside the bustling suburbs of a big city. My neighborhood, on the east side, has its struggles. It's the part of town where money is tighter, with many renting or owning homes that aren't worth much. But it's not a bad place. My neighbors are friendly folks who greet me with smiles and waves. Sure, crime is a bit more common here than in other parts of town, with a few shootings and even a homicide in recent years. Sadly, our neighbors lost their son to gun violence outside a bar last year. Thankfully, we haven't been directly touched by crime beyond the occasional missing item from our porch. Like many places, our town has been hit hard by the opioid crisis. Fentanyl overdoses have taken too many lives.  But there's hope. We have great resources here, like rehab centers and Narcan training to help families facing addiction.  Despite these challenges, there's a lot to love about this town. My son's elementary school is fantastic. From the principal to the teachers and support staff, they're all wonderful. My son, who has special needs, feels safe and accepted there, and he loves going to school. Our active PTO organizes events all year round to get families involved and support learning. Because so many families struggle financially, the school provides free breakfast and lunch for every student, making sure no child goes hungry. They don't judge anyone based on their ability to pay, and they keep school fees and costs for supplies and field trips very reasonable. The city council has been working hard to spruce up town, repaving roads, planting flowers, and fixing up parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have been focused on the central area and the west side, where most of the shops and traffic are. The east side, where I live, seems to be forgotten, which is frustrating for those of us who live here.  All things considered, I'm happy living in this town.  People are friendly, the schools are great, we have plenty of shopping options, and while our home might not be worth much, it's comfortable and it's ours.  We've lived here for over 16 years, and we can't imagine being anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood pulsates with a vibrant culture, nestled upon a hilltop adorned with buildings steeped in history. I reside in a seven-story apartment building directly across from a historic theater, and just a short distance away, a quirky arcade bar beckons diverse crowds on warm summer evenings, often brimming with lines of eager patrons, especially during those languid June and July weekends.  A short stroll takes me to the nearest city park, a sprawling green oasis amidst the urban landscape. Surrounding it is a concrete perimeter, punctuated by towering staircases embedded in the wall. During the harsh winter months, when icy winds bite and the rain falls in relentless sheets, a community of individuals experiencing homelessness find refuge in neat rows of tents, strategically positioned along the sidewalks and steps.  Their proximity to each other, and the heart of the city, provides a measure of warmth and accessibility to essential resources like the nearby family center, offering a sanctuary for showers and meals. \n\nYet, my affection for this city transcends its historic grandeur - the towering edifices, the intricate architecture that adorns the undulating hills leading down to the ocean. My heart is captivated by the spirit of its people.  Hilltop, once notorious for gang violence on the West Coast, still echoes with tales of the government's relentless pursuit to eradicate the issue. These stories, passed down through generations, serve as a constant reminder of the neighborhood's past struggles. Despite its reputation as one of the city's rougher areas, the residents persevere, diligently tending to their community, their spirits unbroken.  Warnings against venturing out alone at night, particularly for those who are not from the neighborhood, linger - echoes of a bygone era. Perhaps it is my own complexion, allowing me to blend in, or maybe Hilltop recognizes a kindred spirit in me, someone who shares a deep understanding of the insidious nature of societal prejudice and assumptions that plague our nation. Regardless, I feel an undeniable connection to this place.\n\nHilltop is home.  Walking its streets at night, I am enveloped by a sense of belonging.  I have been offered warmth and kindness by strangers, their generosity outweighing any fear.  It is a place where a laundromat owner extended their closing time to let me charge my phone during a torrential downpour, a place where, on a particularly bleak night, a stranger saw me huddled in the shadows and offered me not just five dollars, but a look of genuine connection, affirming my worth and beauty.",
            "I call a slice of Rural America home, specifically a small town in Michigan. Imagine a world where farmland seamlessly blends into quaint tourist spots, but forget the hustle and bustle of big city life – no sprawling malls, no chain stores like Walmart or Target, not even the familiar red neon of an Applebee's.  Getting around means a car is your constant companion.  \n\nYet, here I live in one of the most breathtaking places on Earth, surrounded by water. My town is cradled by the beauty of Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix, with beaches beckoning from every corner.\n\nOur neighborhood embodies the spirit of small-town charm. Houses aren't huddled together like sardines, each one a unique story etched in brick and wood. Some have been lovingly updated, while others wear their age proudly.  Most boast full basements, visible from the street, and many sport classic aluminum siding in a rainbow of colors. \n\nFront yards are a common sight, bursting with life: trampolines bouncing, playsets clamoring, gardens bursting with blooms, and fences guarding furry friends.  It's a picture of Middle America: hardworking families raising children, creating memories, and forging a sense of community. \n\nKids chase each other down sidewalks, dogs get their daily exercise, and neighbors greet each other with waves and smiles. Lawns are manicured, reflecting a quiet pride in their surroundings. There's no extravagant display of wealth here, but a simple, genuine warmth that speaks volumes. \n\nThis isn't a neighborhood that shouts its beauty; it whispers it. It's a place where you can picture raising a family, where kids can play freely, and where the air is thick with the promise of peace.\n\nJust a stone's throw away, you'll find the sheriff's department and jail, the health department, and the recycling center, all symbols of community responsibility. The sound of cheers from nearby baseball and softball fields mixes with the rumble of small planes taking off and landing at the nearby airport.  Even a craving for ice cream can be satisfied with a short walk, and for those who dare, a bike ride can take you to the heart of town. \n\nIt's a simple life, but a good one. It's a place where I can truly feel at home."
