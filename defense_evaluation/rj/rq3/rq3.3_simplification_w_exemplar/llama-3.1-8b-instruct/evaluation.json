            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most houses are for one family, but some homes are divided into two, connected as one. My home has a small yard in front and a small driveway on the left. It looks like the past, when living in the suburbs was a big dream. But now, people are not as happy as they used to be. The little yards do not look as nice as they used to. However, there are still cars in every driveway, and children play outside. A public school that has been here for almost 90 years is still standing. It makes young people think about the future and makes old people remember the past. There are few churches, but the basketball courts are full. All the houses look different, but feel the same. A large store called Super A is owned by a Yemni family. Most people in my neighborhood are African American. The streets are wide, and children play football. People have lived here for many years, and most know each other's stories. A karate school used to be here, but now it is a pharmacy because people think medicine makes things better. There is also a small movie theater that shows old movies at a low price. Young people do not like it because it does not have new movies, but old people like it because it is cheap and fun. There is a big road that goes through my town. But the entrance and exit are in the next town. Some people wanted to have an exit in our town, but the old people said it would ruin the town. Now, they are building a new high school, and we need a mascot for our town. I think a robot with a country accent and a log cabin would be a good choice.",
            "You might not see it at first. It looks like a normal area behind a shopping place. But if you go behind the old, empty store and walk to the back of the hotels, you will find a community. The hotels are not used most of the time, except for family visits in the summer.\n\nThere are many apartment buildings in the community.

They run and play in the grass. They ride their skateboards and play on the swings.\n\nOld people walk their dogs. They scold teenagers and talk to other old people. There is a place to buy sushi and a store to buy swimming things. You can get a manicure and fill your pool at the same time. There is a place to buy frozen yogurt too.

I said, \"In my town, there are many corn fields too.\" She listened. She started to understand where I came from.\n\nWe drove along a country road. We saw a big hole in the ground filled with water.

Some people like this because Portland was once a small city with a low cost of living. It had many unique and creative groups of people. Today, many people from California are moving to Portland. They are building new homes and businesses. But Portland is still a weird city. It means Portland accepts things that other cities do not. Portland has modern things and modern problems. People in Portland buy many things from China. But Portland is not all weird. It has yoga, hipsters, and business people. Portland is a place where people do not take things too seriously. In my neighborhood, there are colorful houses and gardens. People put out boxes with free things. These boxes can have clothes, books, or anything else. They are like treasures for people walking by. This is what Portland is like to me. But not everyone is like me. Some people I live with would never take things from a box. They go to goat yoga or soccer games. Portland has many people who like different things. People in Portland chase their dreams, or they drink too much at bars. Portland has problems. Some people have mental health problems related to drugs. The city also has a problem with people who do not have homes. The city helps these people, but not enough. Some people in Portland do not know what to do about the homeless problem. They are unhappy about it. This is not a strange thing about Portland. Many cities have the same problem.",

You will hear loud cars and people. If you visit at night, be careful. This neighborhood is safe, but some people can be a problem. You may meet people who want to cause trouble. I have had problems in the past. People have stolen packages here. It is also a problem that people do not clean up after their dogs. You will see dog waste on the street in the morning. It is not a nice thing to see. Be careful and keep your shoes clean.",
            "I live in a place where there are few sidewalks. My house is at the top of a big hill. People call this hill the \"workout hill\" because many people like to run up it. There are no sidewalks on my street, so people walk on the road. The road is not smooth in some places and can be hard to drive on. The telephone and electric wires look old and broken. It rains a lot here, so branches and leaves often hit the power lines. This makes the wires look bad.\n\nThere are many tall evergreen trees everywhere. But people do not like these trees. They want to cut them down because the trees block the view of the ocean. Many houses are built on the hill with big windows to see the ocean. It looks beautiful at sunset when the water shines and the sky turns orange. But it is often cloudy and damp. Moss grows on everything: roofs, cars, and railings. I left my car outside for a month, and when I went to use it, it was covered with moss. It took me three hours to clean it off.\n\nThere are not many children here, but there is a school nearby. Most people in my neighborhood are old and retired. They have dogs instead of kids. It is common to see dogs in people's lawns or running down the street. If you leave your door open, they might come in. I once found a dog in my living room and had to chase it out.\n\nThere are many rabbits in the area. They dig up plants and make holes in people's lawns. My cats like them and have chased most of them away. We also see small birds, hummingbirds, and sometimes a hawk or eagle. But the crows chase it away.\n\nThere are no stores near my house, but if you walk down the hill to the waterfront, there are restaurants that serve fresh seafood. The water is not very wide, and you can see the other side even on cloudy days.",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. It is a quiet neighborhood. We have a main street that connects two highways. This means we have some traffic. But we also have a quiet neighborhood. Not many people move to our town. I know most of the people here. They work in their yards and do other things. In the winter, we sled down a hill. We live in a house at the front of our street. We see everyone who comes and goes. We know their cars. We see any new car and take note of it. Some neighbors walk to get exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids ride their bikes. We like to be at home. We work from home. There are four of us: my wife, two daughters, and me. They are 11 and 14 years old. Everyone knows us. We go outside and play. We even play in the rain. We also grill on our back porch. It smells good when we grill. We have many trees in our neighborhood. It was once a forest. It is cool and shady here. But we have to clean up leaves in the fall. We burn the leaves. I like the smell of burning leaves. It means fall is here. This year, we did not have a long winter. It felt like a long fall. We do not use our front door much. It is at the back of our house. We have a big garage. I like to work on my truck and other things there. When the doors are open, I feel connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, it is quiet here. We visit with families on Thanksgiving and other holidays. It is nice living here. If we did not have a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is in the middle of the desert. There is a lot of dirt here. It is hard to imagine living in a place with so much brown. When I first moved here in the 90s, houses were far apart. Now, there are more homes. The area looks more like a city each day. But this is happening in many places. People in my neighborhood are usually kind. However, like any city, there are good and bad parts. I live near many older people. They are friendly. The stores in this area are mostly big chains like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want healthy food, you need to go somewhere else. Many people in my city work in construction. This is because the city is still not very developed. There are many places to build. I like my home the way it is. I moved from a big city and do not want to go back. My job is in construction. I work with drywall and T-bars. I like the animals in my area. The desert is beautiful. It has many different types of wildlife. We should learn about these animals to coexist with them safely. My family and I like the animals here. My children love lizards and desert bugs. They are outside now, trying to catch them. Victorville is a good place for families to visit the desert. We have some fun things to do. The San Bernardino County Fair is a good event to visit. The fair is fun and has many activities. You can also visit Wrightwood to ski and see the snow-covered mountains. If you are interested in the desert's history and culture, visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has many interesting objects and artifacts.",
            "My neighborhood is special. It is the college campus where I live. The people in my dorm are my community. I also consider the campus area around my dorm as my neighborhood. My neighborhood has some things like other neighborhoods. It has houses, people, stores and parks.\n\nLet's talk about the houses. There are three kinds of houses near me. They are apartments, houses and dorms. In the apartments, 2-4 people live in each room. There are 4-6 rooms on each floor. Each building has 2 floors and about 20 people live there. Some houses are available for students to rent. These houses have 2-4 bedrooms. Only a few of these houses are in my neighborhood. Most students live in dorms. Each dorm room has 2 people. This is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood.\n\nMy school values diversity. My neighborhood has people from many cultures and ages. The staff live in houses and the new students live in dorms. The older students live in apartments. Let's talk about the stores and parks in my neighborhood. My school is a self-contained area. It has many stores and one park. The stores have food, clothes and other things. My neighborhood has what I need. The park is for everyone. The campus keeps the park clean and safe.",
            "I have lived in this neighborhood for about 10 years. When I first came here, I was sad. I missed my old home in Riverdale. My family moved to Stockbridge for a better house and school. My mom and dad wanted the best for me and my sister. \n\nOver time, I got used to my new home. I made some new friends and some enemies in school. I did not really know my neighbors. But I got to know Mr. Glen and his children. They are very nice. I also got to know Dennis a little bit. They live next door to us. I like them very much.\n\nI remember going to Mr. Glen's wedding. It was fun. I danced with his daughter, Marsharii. She is very nice. I hope she is doing well. The neighborhood is like a maze. But I now have a GPS to help me find my way. I have made some good friends here. We like to play video games together. We also like to go to the park and play outside. I like to practice my balance by throwing sticks. I also like to practice with my wooden sword. There is a basketball and tennis court here. My dad taught me how to play tennis with Mr. Graves. I had a lot of fun playing tennis when I was younger.\n\nI have had many good times in this neighborhood. These are some of my favorite memories. I am excited to see what the future holds.",
            "My apartment is near the college I attend. I like living there. There are many apartment buildings, some restaurants and bars. These places are fun to visit and not very expensive. One bar changed its name. It is now more expensive, but not bad. Most people are friendly. They are either college students or lower-income people. They cannot afford expensive housing. There are many children in my area. There is a school near my apartment. I do not know my neighbors. They smoke a lot. My apartment manager put an air freshener near their door. This was funny to me and my boyfriend. It is a little insulting.\n\nThe buildings around me are old but nice inside. Some buildings down the street are new, but not well-made. They cost a lot to rent. I do not like them. The road near my apartment was fixed last summer. Now it is nice. There are sidewalks, grass and trees. My apartment has many trees. Some were cut down, but there are many left. Behind my apartment is a line of trees. Then there are more apartments.\n\nI live on 42nd street. Behind my street is 43rd street. It is not as nice. The sidewalks are bad and the buildings look old. There are many trees on this street, but they hide how old the buildings are. There is crime in my area. Most of it happens at an apartment complex on 43rd street. There are also apartments with crime across from me. But I like where I live. I can afford it. There are many amenities nearby. The university is close and there are bus stops. I can easily go to the store or downtown.",
            "My neighborhood is made up of small houses on a circle street. The houses are placed far apart and look like they are alone. They are all the same - yellow with white porches and green roofs. Most of the people in the neighborhood are friends. We stand at the end of a street some evenings and talk to each other while children play. It is a nice place in a world with many computers and machines. It is peaceful and quiet. We have fields and trees around us with blue skies and white clouds. But we have a problem. There are tornado warnings in this season. We heard a siren for the first time last night. We had to go to a safe place. I went to my bathtub with my little dog and some pillows. My big dog stayed in the living room and was scared. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of hail. The hail melted on the hot pavement. The weather changed very fast. It went from hot to cold. I saw a double rainbow in the sky. I took pictures of it. My friends and family were amazed. The neighborhood was quiet for a while. Then people came home and it was normal again. Moms and children were outside. The neighborhood is friendly. I like it here. I moved from another state. I like the way people talk here. I have a two-bedroom apartment like everyone else. But inside, the apartments are not all the same. Some are very small. I like to walk in a big field behind my house. I see deer and hear a big frog singing in the morning. It is a great place to live. It is not far from the city of Charlotte. I wake up each morning to the sound of roosters. It is like living in a small village.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood when I started eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first. I got close to two friends who lived nearby. One was two houses down from me and the other was on my street. But they do not live here anymore. The people who were here when I moved here are still here.\n\nMy neighborhood is like many American neighborhoods. It has many two-story houses. I hear children playing outside on the weekends. The neighborhood is quiet most of the time. I have never had problems with the people in the neighborhood. They leave me alone, unless I need help. I have ordered packages online many times and they have not been stolen.\n\nI can trust my neighbors. There is a park near my house. I have many good memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with my friends. I also got hurt there, but the good memories are more important. Now, I visit the park to spend time with my cousin's children. They are young and like to play on swings and slides.\n\nThe neighborhood has many different kinds of food. You can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants within a short walk. But many people now use apps to get food delivered. The most popular food is from fast food shops. There are also many pizza places. The stores here have everything you need. There are dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a grocery store.\n\nI like my neighborhood. When I see bad stories on social media, I am happy to have such a good neighborhood.",
            "My neighborhood is a small town in South Carolina. It is a good place for farmers. Johnston is called the Peach Capital of the World. This is written on a sign at the entrance to the town. Many farms are in the area. There are peach trees and cattle. Most houses are two stories high. They have metal roofs or gray shingles to keep cool in the summer. Houses are far from the road. They are close to fields for animals and crops.\n\nIn the middle of town, there is one stop light. This is where people can buy food or go shopping. There are only a few stores in the town. You can buy fast food at Hong Kong, a Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger place. There used to be a pizzeria, but it closed. There is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They are famous for selling Cherry Coca-Cola. There is a small grocery store called IGA. It is the only place to buy groceries in the town. But people usually go to a bigger store in another town to buy most of their food.\n\nThe most popular store in town is Dollar General. It sells many things that people need every day. It is always busy. There is a furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. A kind woman runs it. She has been in business for a long time. She even delivers furniture. Next to the furniture store is a pet groomer called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They take care of pets and sell food for them.\n\nThe doctor's office and the animal hospital are not in the middle of town. They are small, but they can help the people of Johnston. There is an elementary school in the town. But when children grow up, they go to school in another town. The town is making a new park. It will be 2.5 acres big. This will give families a place to have fun and attract new people to the town.\n\nThere is not much to do in Johnston. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or playgrounds. But it is a nice place to live. It is so small that you can drive by it and not even notice it.",
            "I first heard about my place on a podcast about missing people. It was a surprise. Many apartments in the area cost over a thousand dollars a month. I had never heard this story before. Neither had my friends.\n\nLife can be hard. I know some of my friends cry at night because things are expensive. We have learned to be careful with money. We like old things. We smell the old toys and clothes at the flea market. As people grow up, they smell less. Some start to smoke or get used to things. But the flea market stays in your mind.\n\nThere are three thrift stores near me. I can visit two stores that help people, a library, a store with old books, and a store with strange things. Downtown is busy. Cars and people fill the streets in the morning. But the thrift stores are quiet. It is a nice place to spend an afternoon.\n\nMore and more people and cars come to the city every year. It is a growing city. One of the biggest companies in the world is here. The city is still learning to grow. It reminds me of New York. People are busy working on their goals. They do not ask many questions. You can be alone and nobody will bother you. This is different from the South. In the South, people ask about each other's lives. Here, you can keep to yourself.\n\nI like my city. There is always something happening. The man who plays the piano next door and the women who sing upstairs make music. We come together for our needs and celebrate special days. We help each other when we can. I am lucky to live here. I like most of my neighbors and they treat me well. We take care of each other.\n\nI live in a big city. But it is the people who make me feel happy. They make me feel like I did not make a mistake with my life.",
            "I live in a typical suburb. My neighborhood is part of a large community with many houses. The houses are well-maintained and look the same. The homeowner's association makes sure they are nice.\n\nAll the houses have one or two stories. They have single car garages. But we don't have individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, there is a group of mailboxes at the end of the street. You need a key to get your mail.\n\nMy house is near the edge of the city. It has a lot of land. We have many nice things. There are community pools and walking trails. You can walk your dog or go for a walk by yourself. The neighborhood is safe. Many people are retired. But we also have middle-aged and young people.\n\nThe city is not small. It has many stores and amenities. We have one big store called a mall. It has many stores inside. You can drive to many places in 15 minutes. There are high-end stores and stores with low prices.\n\nMy neighborhood is a good place to live. It is safe and nice. We have many things to do. We can walk or ride our cars to get what we need.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest. It is near a big city, but not in the suburbs. My neighborhood is on the east side of town. This area is not rich. Many houses are rented or owned by people who do not have a lot of money. But it is not a bad place. My neighbors are friendly and say hello when I walk by. Crime is more common here than in other parts of town, but it is still not very high. There have been some violent crimes near my home in the last ten years. Our neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a bar last year. We have not been directly affected by crime, but we have had some problems with theft. Unfortunately, our town has been hurt by the opioid problem that is affecting many places in the United States. Many people have died from fentanyl overdoses. However, there are resources to help people with addiction. There are centers to help people get better and training for families and friends.\n\nMy son's school is very good. The teachers and staff are excellent. My son has special needs, but he has not been bullied. The school has a positive atmosphere. They have many events to get families involved and to help students learn. The school gives free breakfast and lunch to all students. No student goes hungry. The school does not treat anyone unfairly because of how much money their family has. The town has made some improvements, but mostly in the center of town and the west side. The east side, where I live, needs more attention. This is a problem for my neighbors and me. I like living here. People are friendly, the school is good, and there are shops to buy what we need. Our home is comfortable and okay. We have lived here for over 16 years and do not want to move.",
            "My neighborhood is different. It has a lot of history. The area is on a hill. Many old buildings are here. Some have a lot of meaning. I live in a 7-story apartment building near an old theater. A nearby block has a fun arcade bar. Many kinds of people go there on warm summer nights. There is often a line of people waiting to get in. A park is near our area. It is big for the size of the city. The park is surrounded by concrete and stairs. People without homes set up tents on the sidewalk and stairs during the cold winter months. They stay near the city center, where it is warmer. They can walk or take a bus to a place where they can wash and shower. \n\nI like my city, not just the old buildings and hills. I like the people. This area used to be very bad. People used to fight a lot. It was called a tough neighborhood. But the people here work hard to keep the area clean. They care about their city and their block. Some people say it is not safe for white people to walk here at night. I think this is because of the past. I am not white, but I am light-skinned. Maybe people see me as one of them. They are kind to me. Laundromat owners stay open late so I can charge my phone. People give me money and tell me I am beautiful. I feel safe walking here at night.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan, America. The town is in a beautiful place near two big lakes, Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. I like my town because it is quiet and peaceful. We have no big city stores like Wal-mart or Target. If we need something, we drive to get it. My town has a small airport, a park, and a baseball field. You can hear planes taking off and landing, and people calling out scores during games. \n\nMy neighborhood is very friendly. People know each other and say hello. We have many different kinds of houses. Some are old, some are new, and some have aluminum siding. People take care of their yards and keep them clean. They have green grass and nice lawns. It is a good place to live because it is safe. Our town has a sheriff's department and a health department. We also have a recycling center where people take their trash. My kids can ride their bikes to the park. The park is only a short walk from our houses. It is a great place to live."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "My city is very big and diverse. Many kinds of people live there. Residential areas are near businesses, like stores and restaurants. Some businesses are small and new.

We have a place for the LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and people from the former Soviet Union. The city has many communities, like Korea town and China town. They are a few miles away.\n\nBut the city is very big, and it takes a long time to get places. Many people do not walk. They drive. There is a lot of traffic, and it is hard to find parking.

            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most houses are for one family, but some homes are divided into two, connected as one. My home has a small yard in front and a small driveway on the left. It looks like the past, when living in the suburbs was a big dream. But now, people are not as happy as they used to be. The little yards do not look as nice as they used to. However, there are still cars in every driveway, and children play outside. A public school that has been here for almost 90 years is still standing. It makes young people think about the future and makes old people remember the past. There are few churches, but the basketball courts are full. All the houses look different, but feel the same. A large store called Super A is owned by a Yemni family. Most people in my neighborhood are African American. The streets are wide, and children play football. People have lived here for many years, and most know each other's stories. A karate school used to be here, but now it is a pharmacy because people think medicine makes things better. There is also a small movie theater that shows old movies at a low price. Young people do not like it because it does not have new movies, but old people like it because it is cheap and fun. There is a big road that goes through my town. But the entrance and exit are in the next town. Some people wanted to have an exit in our town, but the old people said it would ruin the town. Now, they are building a new high school, and we need a mascot for our town. I think a robot with a country accent and a log cabin would be a good choice.",
            "You might not see it at first. It looks like a normal area behind a shopping place. But if you go behind the old, empty store and walk to the back of the hotels, you will find a community. The hotels are not used most of the time, except for family visits in the summer.\n\nThere are many apartment buildings in the community. They are like dolls that have been taken apart and put next to each other. The first buildings you see have had problems. We will not talk about them too much. But the other buildings are a different story. Many people do not know about them.\n\nAcross from the buildings is a small college. Students go there to learn. They have coffee in their hands and look sleepy in the morning. The gates open slowly for them. Drivers honk their horns and get mad when they have to stop.\n\nThe road goes into another street. There is a park and a place to help people who hurt their bones. The center has nice furniture on the porch. The air moves slowly with a big fan. Children play in the park. They run and play in the grass. They ride their skateboards and play on the swings.\n\nOld people walk their dogs. They scold teenagers and talk to other old people. There is a place to buy sushi and a store to buy swimming things. You can get a manicure and fill your pool at the same time. There is a place to buy frozen yogurt too. Teenagers eat yogurt and ride their skateboards.\n\nThis is a nice neighborhood. It is a part of America's history. Not much changes here, not even time.",

She was used to living in a town where the grocery store was close to her house.\n\nI grew up in a place like this. I wanted to tell her about it. I said, \"In my town, there are many corn fields too.\" She listened. She started to understand where I came from.\n\nWe drove along a country road. We saw a big hole in the ground filled with water. Past it was my neighborhood. My house is made of brick and stucco. Each house has a big yard. People are proud of their yards. In the spring, flowers and trees are everywhere.

They are building new homes and businesses. But Portland is still a weird city. It means Portland accepts things that other cities do not. Portland has modern things and modern problems. People in Portland buy many things from China. But Portland is not all weird. It has yoga, hipsters, and business people. Portland is a place where people do not take things too seriously. In my neighborhood, there are colorful houses and gardens. People put out boxes with free things. These boxes can have clothes, books, or anything else. They are like treasures for people walking by. This is what Portland is like to me. But not everyone is like me. Some people I live with would never take things from a box. They go to goat yoga or soccer games. Portland has many people who like different things. People in Portland chase their dreams, or they drink too much at bars. Portland has problems. Some people have mental health problems related to drugs. The city also has a problem with people who do not have homes. The city helps these people, but not enough. Some people in Portland do not know what to do about the homeless problem. They are unhappy about it. This is not a strange thing about Portland. Many cities have the same problem.",
            "The mountains are always there. They are in the north. They see the sun rise and set every day. They are always the same. No matter how busy I am, they are there. They are steady and strong.\n\nWhen I am stressed, I look at them. They help me. They give me strength to keep going. I look at the mountains when I need to calm down.\n\nI first saw them when I was in college. The university has its own beautiful places. But the mountains are special. They are the most beautiful thing here.\n\nThe town is also nice. There are many good places to study. I spend a lot of time in cafés. They have good coffee. I can walk or take the bus to the downtown area. It is old and interesting. The buildings are old and colorful.\n\nThe downtown area is busy and fun. It is like a big city. But it is not far from the quiet town. The library is nearby. It is a place to be quiet and think.\n\nThis town has two different feelings. They are close together. It makes the town interesting. I have good memories here. I also have bad memories. All towns have both.\n\nThe ponds are a good place to think and cry. I have done both there. I watch the turtles and ducks. They live their lives. I think about my own life. I try to find my purpose.\n\nI walk to the main street. The sun is shining. The mountains are in the distance. They are strong and steady. They make me feel strong. They help me to keep going.",
            "Bensonhurst is a neighborhood in New York City. It is easy to find because of good public transportation. Many people use public transportation in New York City. Bensonhurst is a city area, so you will feel like you are in New York City. There are many Asian stores in this neighborhood. Many Asian people live here. Over twenty years ago, not many Asian people lived in Bensonhurst. Now, it is different. You can see Asian stores on almost every street. These stores are popular. They sell food, and people like their food. The prices are also low. It is easy to buy food here.\n\nYou can find many Asian supermarkets and laundromats. These stores are popular with local people. They like the food, the prices, and it is easy to go there. Near where I live, there are four Asian supermarkets. You can walk to them in two minutes. This makes it easy to buy food.\n\nBensonhurst is not only Asian. There are many people from different countries and their children. Many big businesses are owned by Asian people. There is a park near here. The park has many things to do. It has basketball courts, a big field, handball courts, swings, and a playground for children. There is also a water fountain for children to play in the summer.\n\nThe park is not alone. There are many two-family houses and co-op living buildings. Most people are nice, but some are very loud. You will hear loud cars and people. If you visit at night, be careful. This neighborhood is safe, but some people can be a problem. You may meet people who want to cause trouble. I have had problems in the past. People have stolen packages here. It is also a problem that people do not clean up after their dogs. You will see dog waste on the street in the morning. It is not a nice thing to see. Be careful and keep your shoes clean.",
            "I live in a place where there are few sidewalks. My house is at the top of a big hill. People call this hill the \"workout hill\" because many people like to run up it. There are no sidewalks on my street, so people walk on the road. The road is not smooth in some places and can be hard to drive on. The telephone and electric wires look old and broken. It rains a lot here, so branches and leaves often hit the power lines. This makes the wires look bad.\n\nThere are many tall evergreen trees everywhere. But people do not like these trees. They want to cut them down because the trees block the view of the ocean. Many houses are built on the hill with big windows to see the ocean. It looks beautiful at sunset when the water shines and the sky turns orange. But it is often cloudy and damp. Moss grows on everything: roofs, cars, and railings. I left my car outside for a month, and when I went to use it, it was covered with moss. It took me three hours to clean it off.\n\nThere are not many children here, but there is a school nearby. Most people in my neighborhood are old and retired. They have dogs instead of kids. It is common to see dogs in people's lawns or running down the street. If you leave your door open, they might come in. I once found a dog in my living room and had to chase it out.\n\nThere are many rabbits in the area. They dig up plants and make holes in people's lawns. My cats like them and have chased most of them away. We also see small birds, hummingbirds, and sometimes a hawk or eagle. But the crows chase it away.\n\nThere are no stores near my house, but if you walk down the hill to the waterfront, there are restaurants that serve fresh seafood. The water is not very wide, and you can see the other side even on cloudy days.",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. It is a quiet neighborhood. We have a main street that connects two highways. This means we have some traffic. But we also have a quiet neighborhood. Not many people move to our town. I know most of the people here. They work in their yards and do other things. In the winter, we sled down a hill. We live in a house at the front of our street. We see everyone who comes and goes. We know their cars. We see any new car and take note of it. Some neighbors walk to get exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids ride their bikes. We like to be at home. We work from home. There are four of us: my wife, two daughters, and me. They are 11 and 14 years old. Everyone knows us. We go outside and play. We even play in the rain. We also grill on our back porch. It smells good when we grill. We have many trees in our neighborhood. It was once a forest. It is cool and shady here. But we have to clean up leaves in the fall. We burn the leaves. I like the smell of burning leaves. It means fall is here. This year, we did not have a long winter. It felt like a long fall. We do not use our front door much. It is at the back of our house. We have a big garage. I like to work on my truck and other things there. When the doors are open, I feel connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, it is quiet here. We visit with families on Thanksgiving and other holidays. It is nice living here. If we did not have a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is in the middle of the desert. There is a lot of dirt here. It is hard to imagine living in a place with so much brown. When I first moved here in the 90s, houses were far apart. Now, there are more homes. The area looks more like a city each day. But this is happening in many places. People in my neighborhood are usually kind. However, like any city, there are good and bad parts. I live near many older people. They are friendly. The stores in this area are mostly big chains like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want healthy food, you need to go somewhere else. Many people in my city work in construction. This is because the city is still not very developed. There are many places to build. I like my home the way it is. I moved from a big city and do not want to go back. My job is in construction. I work with drywall and T-bars. I like the animals in my area. The desert is beautiful. It has many different types of wildlife. We should learn about these animals to coexist with them safely. My family and I like the animals here. My children love lizards and desert bugs. They are outside now, trying to catch them. Victorville is a good place for families to visit the desert. We have some fun things to do. The San Bernardino County Fair is a good event to visit. The fair is fun and has many activities. You can also visit Wrightwood to ski and see the snow-covered mountains. If you are interested in the desert's history and culture, visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has many interesting objects and artifacts.",
            "My neighborhood is special. It is the college campus where I live. The people in my dorm are my community. I also consider the campus area around my dorm as my neighborhood. My neighborhood has some things like other neighborhoods. It has houses, people, stores and parks.\n\nLet's talk about the houses. There are three kinds of houses near me. They are apartments, houses and dorms. In the apartments, 2-4 people live in each room. There are 4-6 rooms on each floor. Each building has 2 floors and about 20 people live there. Some houses are available for students to rent. These houses have 2-4 bedrooms. Only a few of these houses are in my neighborhood. Most students live in dorms. Each dorm room has 2 people. This is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood.\n\nMy school values diversity. My neighborhood has people from many cultures and ages. The staff live in houses and the new students live in dorms. The older students live in apartments. Let's talk about the stores and parks in my neighborhood. My school is a self-contained area. It has many stores and one park. The stores have food, clothes and other things. My neighborhood has what I need. The park is for everyone. The campus keeps the park clean and safe.",
            "I have lived in this neighborhood for about 10 years. When I first came here, I was sad. I missed my old home in Riverdale. My family moved to Stockbridge for a better house and school. My mom and dad wanted the best for me and my sister. \n\nOver time, I got used to my new home. I made some new friends and some enemies in school. I did not really know my neighbors. But I got to know Mr. Glen and his children. They are very nice. I also got to know Dennis a little bit. They live next door to us. I like them very much.\n\nI remember going to Mr. Glen's wedding. It was fun. I danced with his daughter, Marsharii. She is very nice. I hope she is doing well. The neighborhood is like a maze. But I now have a GPS to help me find my way. I have made some good friends here. We like to play video games together. We also like to go to the park and play outside. I like to practice my balance by throwing sticks. I also like to practice with my wooden sword. There is a basketball and tennis court here. My dad taught me how to play tennis with Mr. Graves. I had a lot of fun playing tennis when I was younger.\n\nI have had many good times in this neighborhood. These are some of my favorite memories. I am excited to see what the future holds.",
            "My apartment is near the college I attend. I like living there. There are many apartment buildings, some restaurants and bars. These places are fun to visit and not very expensive. One bar changed its name. It is now more expensive, but not bad. Most people are friendly. They are either college students or lower-income people. They cannot afford expensive housing. There are many children in my area. There is a school near my apartment. I do not know my neighbors. They smoke a lot. My apartment manager put an air freshener near their door. This was funny to me and my boyfriend. It is a little insulting.\n\nThe buildings around me are old but nice inside. Some buildings down the street are new, but not well-made. They cost a lot to rent. I do not like them. The road near my apartment was fixed last summer. Now it is nice. There are sidewalks, grass and trees. My apartment has many trees. Some were cut down, but there are many left. Behind my apartment is a line of trees. Then there are more apartments.\n\nI live on 42nd street. Behind my street is 43rd street. It is not as nice. The sidewalks are bad and the buildings look old. There are many trees on this street, but they hide how old the buildings are. There is crime in my area. Most of it happens at an apartment complex on 43rd street. There are also apartments with crime across from me. But I like where I live. I can afford it. There are many amenities nearby. The university is close and there are bus stops. I can easily go to the store or downtown.",
            "My neighborhood is made up of small houses on a circle street. The houses are placed far apart and look like they are alone. They are all the same - yellow with white porches and green roofs. Most of the people in the neighborhood are friends. We stand at the end of a street some evenings and talk to each other while children play. It is a nice place in a world with many computers and machines. It is peaceful and quiet. We have fields and trees around us with blue skies and white clouds. But we have a problem. There are tornado warnings in this season. We heard a siren for the first time last night. We had to go to a safe place. I went to my bathtub with my little dog and some pillows. My big dog stayed in the living room and was scared. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of hail. The hail melted on the hot pavement. The weather changed very fast. It went from hot to cold. I saw a double rainbow in the sky. I took pictures of it. My friends and family were amazed. The neighborhood was quiet for a while. Then people came home and it was normal again. Moms and children were outside. The neighborhood is friendly. I like it here. I moved from another state. I like the way people talk here. I have a two-bedroom apartment like everyone else. But inside, the apartments are not all the same. Some are very small. I like to walk in a big field behind my house. I see deer and hear a big frog singing in the morning. It is a great place to live. It is not far from the city of Charlotte. I wake up each morning to the sound of roosters. It is like living in a small village.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood when I started eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first. I got close to two friends who lived nearby. One was two houses down from me and the other was on my street. But they do not live here anymore. The people who were here when I moved here are still here.\n\nMy neighborhood is like many American neighborhoods. It has many two-story houses. I hear children playing outside on the weekends. The neighborhood is quiet most of the time. I have never had problems with the people in the neighborhood. They leave me alone, unless I need help. I have ordered packages online many times and they have not been stolen.\n\nI can trust my neighbors. There is a park near my house. I have many good memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with my friends. I also got hurt there, but the good memories are more important. Now, I visit the park to spend time with my cousin's children. They are young and like to play on swings and slides.\n\nThe neighborhood has many different kinds of food. You can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants within a short walk. But many people now use apps to get food delivered. The most popular food is from fast food shops. There are also many pizza places. The stores here have everything you need. There are dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a grocery store.\n\nI like my neighborhood. When I see bad stories on social media, I am happy to have such a good neighborhood.",
            "My neighborhood is a small town in South Carolina. It is a good place for farmers. Johnston is called the Peach Capital of the World. This is written on a sign at the entrance to the town. Many farms are in the area. There are peach trees and cattle. Most houses are two stories high. They have metal roofs or gray shingles to keep cool in the summer. Houses are far from the road. They are close to fields for animals and crops.\n\nIn the middle of town, there is one stop light. This is where people can buy food or go shopping. There are only a few stores in the town. You can buy fast food at Hong Kong, a Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger place. There used to be a pizzeria, but it closed. There is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They are famous for selling Cherry Coca-Cola. There is a small grocery store called IGA. It is the only place to buy groceries in the town. But people usually go to a bigger store in another town to buy most of their food.\n\nThe most popular store in town is Dollar General. It sells many things that people need every day. It is always busy. There is a furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. A kind woman runs it. She has been in business for a long time. She even delivers furniture. Next to the furniture store is a pet groomer called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They take care of pets and sell food for them.\n\nThe doctor's office and the animal hospital are not in the middle of town. They are small, but they can help the people of Johnston. There is an elementary school in the town. But when children grow up, they go to school in another town. The town is making a new park. It will be 2.5 acres big. This will give families a place to have fun and attract new people to the town.\n\nThere is not much to do in Johnston. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or playgrounds. But it is a nice place to live. It is so small that you can drive by it and not even notice it.",
            "I first heard about my place on a podcast about missing people. It was a surprise. Many apartments in the area cost over a thousand dollars a month. I had never heard this story before. Neither had my friends.\n\nLife can be hard. I know some of my friends cry at night because things are expensive. We have learned to be careful with money. We like old things. We smell the old toys and clothes at the flea market. As people grow up, they smell less. Some start to smoke or get used to things. But the flea market stays in your mind.\n\nThere are three thrift stores near me. I can visit two stores that help people, a library, a store with old books, and a store with strange things. Downtown is busy. Cars and people fill the streets in the morning. But the thrift stores are quiet. It is a nice place to spend an afternoon.\n\nMore and more people and cars come to the city every year. It is a growing city. One of the biggest companies in the world is here. The city is still learning to grow. It reminds me of New York. People are busy working on their goals. They do not ask many questions. You can be alone and nobody will bother you. This is different from the South. In the South, people ask about each other's lives. Here, you can keep to yourself.\n\nI like my city. There is always something happening. The man who plays the piano next door and the women who sing upstairs make music. We come together for our needs and celebrate special days. We help each other when we can. I am lucky to live here. I like most of my neighbors and they treat me well. We take care of each other.\n\nI live in a big city. But it is the people who make me feel happy. They make me feel like I did not make a mistake with my life.",
            "I live in a typical suburb. My neighborhood is part of a large community with many houses. The houses are well-maintained and look the same. The homeowner's association makes sure they are nice.\n\nAll the houses have one or two stories. They have single car garages. But we don't have individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, there is a group of mailboxes at the end of the street. You need a key to get your mail.\n\nMy house is near the edge of the city. It has a lot of land. We have many nice things. There are community pools and walking trails. You can walk your dog or go for a walk by yourself. The neighborhood is safe. Many people are retired. But we also have middle-aged and young people.\n\nThe city is not small. It has many stores and amenities. We have one big store called a mall. It has many stores inside. You can drive to many places in 15 minutes. There are high-end stores and stores with low prices.\n\nMy neighborhood is a good place to live. It is safe and nice. We have many things to do. We can walk or ride our cars to get what we need.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest. It is near a big city, but not in the suburbs. My neighborhood is on the east side of town. This area is not rich. Many houses are rented or owned by people who do not have a lot of money. But it is not a bad place. My neighbors are friendly and say hello when I walk by. Crime is more common here than in other parts of town, but it is still not very high. There have been some violent crimes near my home in the last ten years. Our neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a bar last year. We have not been directly affected by crime, but we have had some problems with theft. Unfortunately, our town has been hurt by the opioid problem that is affecting many places in the United States. Many people have died from fentanyl overdoses. However, there are resources to help people with addiction. There are centers to help people get better and training for families and friends.\n\nMy son's school is very good. The teachers and staff are excellent. My son has special needs, but he has not been bullied. The school has a positive atmosphere. They have many events to get families involved and to help students learn. The school gives free breakfast and lunch to all students. No student goes hungry. The school does not treat anyone unfairly because of how much money their family has. The town has made some improvements, but mostly in the center of town and the west side. The east side, where I live, needs more attention. This is a problem for my neighbors and me. I like living here. People are friendly, the school is good, and there are shops to buy what we need. Our home is comfortable and okay. We have lived here for over 16 years and do not want to move.",
            "My neighborhood is different. It has a lot of history. The area is on a hill. Many old buildings are here. Some have a lot of meaning. I live in a 7-story apartment building near an old theater. A nearby block has a fun arcade bar. Many kinds of people go there on warm summer nights. There is often a line of people waiting to get in. A park is near our area. It is big for the size of the city. The park is surrounded by concrete and stairs. People without homes set up tents on the sidewalk and stairs during the cold winter months. They stay near the city center, where it is warmer. They can walk or take a bus to a place where they can wash and shower. \n\nI like my city, not just the old buildings and hills. I like the people. This area used to be very bad. People used to fight a lot. It was called a tough neighborhood. But the people here work hard to keep the area clean. They care about their city and their block. Some people say it is not safe for white people to walk here at night. I think this is because of the past. I am not white, but I am light-skinned. Maybe people see me as one of them. They are kind to me. Laundromat owners stay open late so I can charge my phone. People give me money and tell me I am beautiful. I feel safe walking here at night.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan, America. The town is in a beautiful place near two big lakes, Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. I like my town because it is quiet and peaceful. We have no big city stores like Wal-mart or Target. If we need something, we drive to get it. My town has a small airport, a park, and a baseball field. You can hear planes taking off and landing, and people calling out scores during games. \n\nMy neighborhood is very friendly. People know each other and say hello. We have many different kinds of houses. Some are old, some are new, and some have aluminum siding. People take care of their yards and keep them clean. They have green grass and nice lawns. It is a good place to live because it is safe. Our town has a sheriff's department and a health department. We also have a recycling center where people take their trash. My kids can ride their bikes to the park. The park is only a short walk from our houses. It is a great place to live."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "My city is very big and diverse. Many kinds of people live there. Residential areas are near businesses, like stores and restaurants. Some businesses are small and new.

We have a place for the LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and people from the former Soviet Union. The city has many communities, like Korea town and China town. They are a few miles away.\n\nBut the city is very big, and it takes a long time to get places. Many people do not walk. They drive. There is a lot of traffic, and it is hard to find parking.

            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most houses are for one family, but some homes are divided into two, connected as one. My home has a small yard in front and a small driveway on the left. It looks like the past, when living in the suburbs was a big dream. But now, people are not as happy as they used to be. The little yards do not look as nice as they used to. However, there are still cars in every driveway, and children play outside. A public school that has been here for almost 90 years is still standing. It makes young people think about the future and makes old people remember the past. There are few churches, but the basketball courts are full. All the houses look different, but feel the same. A large store called Super A is owned by a Yemni family. Most people in my neighborhood are African American. The streets are wide, and children play football. People have lived here for many years, and most know each other's stories. A karate school used to be here, but now it is a pharmacy because people think medicine makes things better. There is also a small movie theater that shows old movies at a low price. Young people do not like it because it does not have new movies, but old people like it because it is cheap and fun. There is a big road that goes through my town. But the entrance and exit are in the next town. Some people wanted to have an exit in our town, but the old people said it would ruin the town. Now, they are building a new high school, and we need a mascot for our town. I think a robot with a country accent and a log cabin would be a good choice.",
            "You might not see it at first. It looks like a normal area behind a shopping place. But if you go behind the old, empty store and walk to the back of the hotels, you will find a community. The hotels are not used most of the time, except for family visits in the summer.\n\nThere are many apartment buildings in the community. They are like dolls that have been taken apart and put next to each other. The first buildings you see have had problems. We will not talk about them too much. But the other buildings are a different story. Many people do not know about them.\n\nAcross from the buildings is a small college. Students go there to learn. They have coffee in their hands and look sleepy in the morning. The gates open slowly for them. Drivers honk their horns and get mad when they have to stop.\n\nThe road goes into another street. There is a park and a place to help people who hurt their bones. The center has nice furniture on the porch. The air moves slowly with a big fan. Children play in the park. They run and play in the grass. They ride their skateboards and play on the swings.\n\nOld people walk their dogs. They scold teenagers and talk to other old people. There is a place to buy sushi and a store to buy swimming things. You can get a manicure and fill your pool at the same time. There is a place to buy frozen yogurt too. Teenagers eat yogurt and ride their skateboards.\n\nThis is a nice neighborhood. It is a part of America's history. Not much changes here, not even time.",

She was used to living in a town where the grocery store was close to her house.\n\nI grew up in a place like this. I wanted to tell her about it. I said, \"In my town, there are many corn fields too.\" She listened. She started to understand where I came from.\n\nWe drove along a country road. We saw a big hole in the ground filled with water. Past it was my neighborhood. My house is made of brick and stucco. Each house has a big yard. People are proud of their yards. In the spring, flowers and trees are everywhere.

They are building new homes and businesses. But Portland is still a weird city. It means Portland accepts things that other cities do not. Portland has modern things and modern problems. People in Portland buy many things from China. But Portland is not all weird. It has yoga, hipsters, and business people. Portland is a place where people do not take things too seriously. In my neighborhood, there are colorful houses and gardens. People put out boxes with free things. These boxes can have clothes, books, or anything else. They are like treasures for people walking by. This is what Portland is like to me. But not everyone is like me. Some people I live with would never take things from a box. They go to goat yoga or soccer games. Portland has many people who like different things. People in Portland chase their dreams, or they drink too much at bars. Portland has problems. Some people have mental health problems related to drugs. The city also has a problem with people who do not have homes. The city helps these people, but not enough. Some people in Portland do not know what to do about the homeless problem. They are unhappy about it. This is not a strange thing about Portland. Many cities have the same problem.",
            "The mountains are always there. They are in the north. They see the sun rise and set every day. They are always the same. No matter how busy I am, they are there. They are steady and strong.\n\nWhen I am stressed, I look at them. They help me. They give me strength to keep going. I look at the mountains when I need to calm down.\n\nI first saw them when I was in college. The university has its own beautiful places. But the mountains are special. They are the most beautiful thing here.\n\nThe town is also nice. There are many good places to study. I spend a lot of time in cafés. They have good coffee. I can walk or take the bus to the downtown area. It is old and interesting. The buildings are old and colorful.\n\nThe downtown area is busy and fun. It is like a big city. But it is not far from the quiet town. The library is nearby. It is a place to be quiet and think.\n\nThis town has two different feelings. They are close together. It makes the town interesting. I have good memories here. I also have bad memories. All towns have both.\n\nThe ponds are a good place to think and cry. I have done both there. I watch the turtles and ducks. They live their lives. I think about my own life. I try to find my purpose.\n\nI walk to the main street. The sun is shining. The mountains are in the distance. They are strong and steady. They make me feel strong. They help me to keep going.",
            "Bensonhurst is a neighborhood in New York City. It is easy to find because of good public transportation. Many people use public transportation in New York City. Bensonhurst is a city area, so you will feel like you are in New York City. There are many Asian stores in this neighborhood. Many Asian people live here. Over twenty years ago, not many Asian people lived in Bensonhurst. Now, it is different. You can see Asian stores on almost every street. These stores are popular. They sell food, and people like their food. The prices are also low. It is easy to buy food here.\n\nYou can find many Asian supermarkets and laundromats. These stores are popular with local people. They like the food, the prices, and it is easy to go there. Near where I live, there are four Asian supermarkets. You can walk to them in two minutes. This makes it easy to buy food.\n\nBensonhurst is not only Asian. There are many people from different countries and their children. Many big businesses are owned by Asian people. There is a park near here. The park has many things to do. It has basketball courts, a big field, handball courts, swings, and a playground for children. There is also a water fountain for children to play in the summer.\n\nThe park is not alone. There are many two-family houses and co-op living buildings. Most people are nice, but some are very loud. You will hear loud cars and people. If you visit at night, be careful. This neighborhood is safe, but some people can be a problem. You may meet people who want to cause trouble. I have had problems in the past. People have stolen packages here. It is also a problem that people do not clean up after their dogs. You will see dog waste on the street in the morning. It is not a nice thing to see. Be careful and keep your shoes clean.",
            "I live in a place where there are few sidewalks. My house is at the top of a big hill. People call this hill the \"workout hill\" because many people like to run up it. There are no sidewalks on my street, so people walk on the road. The road is not smooth in some places and can be hard to drive on. The telephone and electric wires look old and broken. It rains a lot here, so branches and leaves often hit the power lines. This makes the wires look bad.\n\nThere are many tall evergreen trees everywhere. But people do not like these trees. They want to cut them down because the trees block the view of the ocean. Many houses are built on the hill with big windows to see the ocean. It looks beautiful at sunset when the water shines and the sky turns orange. But it is often cloudy and damp. Moss grows on everything: roofs, cars, and railings. I left my car outside for a month, and when I went to use it, it was covered with moss. It took me three hours to clean it off.\n\nThere are not many children here, but there is a school nearby. Most people in my neighborhood are old and retired. They have dogs instead of kids. It is common to see dogs in people's lawns or running down the street. If you leave your door open, they might come in. I once found a dog in my living room and had to chase it out.\n\nThere are many rabbits in the area. They dig up plants and make holes in people's lawns. My cats like them and have chased most of them away. We also see small birds, hummingbirds, and sometimes a hawk or eagle. But the crows chase it away.\n\nThere are no stores near my house, but if you walk down the hill to the waterfront, there are restaurants that serve fresh seafood. The water is not very wide, and you can see the other side even on cloudy days.",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. It is a quiet neighborhood. We have a main street that connects two highways. This means we have some traffic. But we also have a quiet neighborhood. Not many people move to our town. I know most of the people here. They work in their yards and do other things. In the winter, we sled down a hill. We live in a house at the front of our street. We see everyone who comes and goes. We know their cars. We see any new car and take note of it. Some neighbors walk to get exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids ride their bikes. We like to be at home. We work from home. There are four of us: my wife, two daughters, and me. They are 11 and 14 years old. Everyone knows us. We go outside and play. We even play in the rain. We also grill on our back porch. It smells good when we grill. We have many trees in our neighborhood. It was once a forest. It is cool and shady here. But we have to clean up leaves in the fall. We burn the leaves. I like the smell of burning leaves. It means fall is here. This year, we did not have a long winter. It felt like a long fall. We do not use our front door much. It is at the back of our house. We have a big garage. I like to work on my truck and other things there. When the doors are open, I feel connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, it is quiet here. We visit with families on Thanksgiving and other holidays. It is nice living here. If we did not have a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is in the middle of the desert. There is a lot of dirt here. It is hard to imagine living in a place with so much brown. When I first moved here in the 90s, houses were far apart. Now, there are more homes. The area looks more like a city each day. But this is happening in many places. People in my neighborhood are usually kind. However, like any city, there are good and bad parts. I live near many older people. They are friendly. The stores in this area are mostly big chains like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want healthy food, you need to go somewhere else. Many people in my city work in construction. This is because the city is still not very developed. There are many places to build. I like my home the way it is. I moved from a big city and do not want to go back. My job is in construction. I work with drywall and T-bars. I like the animals in my area. The desert is beautiful. It has many different types of wildlife. We should learn about these animals to coexist with them safely. My family and I like the animals here. My children love lizards and desert bugs. They are outside now, trying to catch them. Victorville is a good place for families to visit the desert. We have some fun things to do. The San Bernardino County Fair is a good event to visit. The fair is fun and has many activities. You can also visit Wrightwood to ski and see the snow-covered mountains. If you are interested in the desert's history and culture, visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has many interesting objects and artifacts.",
            "My neighborhood is special. It is the college campus where I live. The people in my dorm are my community. I also consider the campus area around my dorm as my neighborhood. My neighborhood has some things like other neighborhoods. It has houses, people, stores and parks.\n\nLet's talk about the houses. There are three kinds of houses near me. They are apartments, houses and dorms. In the apartments, 2-4 people live in each room. There are 4-6 rooms on each floor. Each building has 2 floors and about 20 people live there. Some houses are available for students to rent. These houses have 2-4 bedrooms. Only a few of these houses are in my neighborhood. Most students live in dorms. Each dorm room has 2 people. This is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood.\n\nMy school values diversity. My neighborhood has people from many cultures and ages. The staff live in houses and the new students live in dorms. The older students live in apartments. Let's talk about the stores and parks in my neighborhood. My school is a self-contained area. It has many stores and one park. The stores have food, clothes and other things. My neighborhood has what I need. The park is for everyone. The campus keeps the park clean and safe.",
            "I have lived in this neighborhood for about 10 years. When I first came here, I was sad. I missed my old home in Riverdale. My family moved to Stockbridge for a better house and school. My mom and dad wanted the best for me and my sister. \n\nOver time, I got used to my new home. I made some new friends and some enemies in school. I did not really know my neighbors. But I got to know Mr. Glen and his children. They are very nice. I also got to know Dennis a little bit. They live next door to us. I like them very much.\n\nI remember going to Mr. Glen's wedding. It was fun. I danced with his daughter, Marsharii. She is very nice. I hope she is doing well. The neighborhood is like a maze. But I now have a GPS to help me find my way. I have made some good friends here. We like to play video games together. We also like to go to the park and play outside. I like to practice my balance by throwing sticks. I also like to practice with my wooden sword. There is a basketball and tennis court here. My dad taught me how to play tennis with Mr. Graves. I had a lot of fun playing tennis when I was younger.\n\nI have had many good times in this neighborhood. These are some of my favorite memories. I am excited to see what the future holds.",
            "My apartment is near the college I attend. I like living there. There are many apartment buildings, some restaurants and bars. These places are fun to visit and not very expensive. One bar changed its name. It is now more expensive, but not bad. Most people are friendly. They are either college students or lower-income people. They cannot afford expensive housing. There are many children in my area. There is a school near my apartment. I do not know my neighbors. They smoke a lot. My apartment manager put an air freshener near their door. This was funny to me and my boyfriend. It is a little insulting.\n\nThe buildings around me are old but nice inside. Some buildings down the street are new, but not well-made. They cost a lot to rent. I do not like them. The road near my apartment was fixed last summer. Now it is nice. There are sidewalks, grass and trees. My apartment has many trees. Some were cut down, but there are many left. Behind my apartment is a line of trees. Then there are more apartments.\n\nI live on 42nd street. Behind my street is 43rd street. It is not as nice. The sidewalks are bad and the buildings look old. There are many trees on this street, but they hide how old the buildings are. There is crime in my area. Most of it happens at an apartment complex on 43rd street. There are also apartments with crime across from me. But I like where I live. I can afford it. There are many amenities nearby. The university is close and there are bus stops. I can easily go to the store or downtown.",
            "My neighborhood is made up of small houses on a circle street. The houses are placed far apart and look like they are alone. They are all the same - yellow with white porches and green roofs. Most of the people in the neighborhood are friends. We stand at the end of a street some evenings and talk to each other while children play. It is a nice place in a world with many computers and machines. It is peaceful and quiet. We have fields and trees around us with blue skies and white clouds. But we have a problem. There are tornado warnings in this season. We heard a siren for the first time last night. We had to go to a safe place. I went to my bathtub with my little dog and some pillows. My big dog stayed in the living room and was scared. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of hail. The hail melted on the hot pavement. The weather changed very fast. It went from hot to cold. I saw a double rainbow in the sky. I took pictures of it. My friends and family were amazed. The neighborhood was quiet for a while. Then people came home and it was normal again. Moms and children were outside. The neighborhood is friendly. I like it here. I moved from another state. I like the way people talk here. I have a two-bedroom apartment like everyone else. But inside, the apartments are not all the same. Some are very small. I like to walk in a big field behind my house. I see deer and hear a big frog singing in the morning. It is a great place to live. It is not far from the city of Charlotte. I wake up each morning to the sound of roosters. It is like living in a small village.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood when I started eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first. I got close to two friends who lived nearby. One was two houses down from me and the other was on my street. But they do not live here anymore. The people who were here when I moved here are still here.\n\nMy neighborhood is like many American neighborhoods. It has many two-story houses. I hear children playing outside on the weekends. The neighborhood is quiet most of the time. I have never had problems with the people in the neighborhood. They leave me alone, unless I need help. I have ordered packages online many times and they have not been stolen.\n\nI can trust my neighbors. There is a park near my house. I have many good memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with my friends. I also got hurt there, but the good memories are more important. Now, I visit the park to spend time with my cousin's children. They are young and like to play on swings and slides.\n\nThe neighborhood has many different kinds of food. You can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants within a short walk. But many people now use apps to get food delivered. The most popular food is from fast food shops. There are also many pizza places. The stores here have everything you need. There are dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a grocery store.\n\nI like my neighborhood. When I see bad stories on social media, I am happy to have such a good neighborhood.",
            "My neighborhood is a small town in South Carolina. It is a good place for farmers. Johnston is called the Peach Capital of the World. This is written on a sign at the entrance to the town. Many farms are in the area. There are peach trees and cattle. Most houses are two stories high. They have metal roofs or gray shingles to keep cool in the summer. Houses are far from the road. They are close to fields for animals and crops.\n\nIn the middle of town, there is one stop light. This is where people can buy food or go shopping. There are only a few stores in the town. You can buy fast food at Hong Kong, a Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger place. There used to be a pizzeria, but it closed. There is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They are famous for selling Cherry Coca-Cola. There is a small grocery store called IGA. It is the only place to buy groceries in the town. But people usually go to a bigger store in another town to buy most of their food.\n\nThe most popular store in town is Dollar General. It sells many things that people need every day. It is always busy. There is a furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. A kind woman runs it. She has been in business for a long time. She even delivers furniture. Next to the furniture store is a pet groomer called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They take care of pets and sell food for them.\n\nThe doctor's office and the animal hospital are not in the middle of town. They are small, but they can help the people of Johnston. There is an elementary school in the town. But when children grow up, they go to school in another town. The town is making a new park. It will be 2.5 acres big. This will give families a place to have fun and attract new people to the town.\n\nThere is not much to do in Johnston. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or playgrounds. But it is a nice place to live. It is so small that you can drive by it and not even notice it.",
            "I first heard about my place on a podcast about missing people. It was a surprise. Many apartments in the area cost over a thousand dollars a month. I had never heard this story before. Neither had my friends.\n\nLife can be hard. I know some of my friends cry at night because things are expensive. We have learned to be careful with money. We like old things. We smell the old toys and clothes at the flea market. As people grow up, they smell less. Some start to smoke or get used to things. But the flea market stays in your mind.\n\nThere are three thrift stores near me. I can visit two stores that help people, a library, a store with old books, and a store with strange things. Downtown is busy. Cars and people fill the streets in the morning. But the thrift stores are quiet. It is a nice place to spend an afternoon.\n\nMore and more people and cars come to the city every year. It is a growing city. One of the biggest companies in the world is here. The city is still learning to grow. It reminds me of New York. People are busy working on their goals. They do not ask many questions. You can be alone and nobody will bother you. This is different from the South. In the South, people ask about each other's lives. Here, you can keep to yourself.\n\nI like my city. There is always something happening. The man who plays the piano next door and the women who sing upstairs make music. We come together for our needs and celebrate special days. We help each other when we can. I am lucky to live here. I like most of my neighbors and they treat me well. We take care of each other.\n\nI live in a big city. But it is the people who make me feel happy. They make me feel like I did not make a mistake with my life.",
            "I live in a typical suburb. My neighborhood is part of a large community with many houses. The houses are well-maintained and look the same. The homeowner's association makes sure they are nice.\n\nAll the houses have one or two stories. They have single car garages. But we don't have individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, there is a group of mailboxes at the end of the street. You need a key to get your mail.\n\nMy house is near the edge of the city. It has a lot of land. We have many nice things. There are community pools and walking trails. You can walk your dog or go for a walk by yourself. The neighborhood is safe. Many people are retired. But we also have middle-aged and young people.\n\nThe city is not small. It has many stores and amenities. We have one big store called a mall. It has many stores inside. You can drive to many places in 15 minutes. There are high-end stores and stores with low prices.\n\nMy neighborhood is a good place to live. It is safe and nice. We have many things to do. We can walk or ride our cars to get what we need.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest. It is near a big city, but not in the suburbs. My neighborhood is on the east side of town. This area is not rich. Many houses are rented or owned by people who do not have a lot of money. But it is not a bad place. My neighbors are friendly and say hello when I walk by. Crime is more common here than in other parts of town, but it is still not very high. There have been some violent crimes near my home in the last ten years. Our neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a bar last year. We have not been directly affected by crime, but we have had some problems with theft. Unfortunately, our town has been hurt by the opioid problem that is affecting many places in the United States. Many people have died from fentanyl overdoses. However, there are resources to help people with addiction. There are centers to help people get better and training for families and friends.\n\nMy son's school is very good. The teachers and staff are excellent. My son has special needs, but he has not been bullied. The school has a positive atmosphere. They have many events to get families involved and to help students learn. The school gives free breakfast and lunch to all students. No student goes hungry. The school does not treat anyone unfairly because of how much money their family has. The town has made some improvements, but mostly in the center of town and the west side. The east side, where I live, needs more attention. This is a problem for my neighbors and me. I like living here. People are friendly, the school is good, and there are shops to buy what we need. Our home is comfortable and okay. We have lived here for over 16 years and do not want to move.",
            "My neighborhood is different. It has a lot of history. The area is on a hill. Many old buildings are here. Some have a lot of meaning. I live in a 7-story apartment building near an old theater. A nearby block has a fun arcade bar. Many kinds of people go there on warm summer nights. There is often a line of people waiting to get in. A park is near our area. It is big for the size of the city. The park is surrounded by concrete and stairs. People without homes set up tents on the sidewalk and stairs during the cold winter months. They stay near the city center, where it is warmer. They can walk or take a bus to a place where they can wash and shower. \n\nI like my city, not just the old buildings and hills. I like the people. This area used to be very bad. People used to fight a lot. It was called a tough neighborhood. But the people here work hard to keep the area clean. They care about their city and their block. Some people say it is not safe for white people to walk here at night. I think this is because of the past. I am not white, but I am light-skinned. Maybe people see me as one of them. They are kind to me. Laundromat owners stay open late so I can charge my phone. People give me money and tell me I am beautiful. I feel safe walking here at night.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan, America. The town is in a beautiful place near two big lakes, Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. I like my town because it is quiet and peaceful. We have no big city stores like Wal-mart or Target. If we need something, we drive to get it. My town has a small airport, a park, and a baseball field. You can hear planes taking off and landing, and people calling out scores during games. \n\nMy neighborhood is very friendly. People know each other and say hello. We have many different kinds of houses. Some are old, some are new, and some have aluminum siding. People take care of their yards and keep them clean. They have green grass and nice lawns. It is a good place to live because it is safe. Our town has a sheriff's department and a health department. We also have a recycling center where people take their trash. My kids can ride their bikes to the park. The park is only a short walk from our houses. It is a great place to live."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "I live in a big city. My neighborhood is different. There are homes and businesses close together. Some areas are for homes, and others are for stores, restaurants, and fun places. There are many new places to eat and shop. Some stores are big and well-known, but small stores are also popular. These small stores are in malls and on the street. The streets are close to quiet neighborhoods.\n\nThere are parks near my home. People go to these parks with their young children. My neighborhood is also very diverse. There are many different kinds of people. In one area, there is a group of people who are LGBTQ+. There is also a Jewish community and a group of people from the former Soviet Union. Outside my neighborhood, there are many more people from different countries. They live in areas called Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia. However, these places are far apart. It takes a long time to drive between them.\n\nMy city is very big. People do not usually walk. Traffic is very bad. It takes a long time to drive anywhere, especially during rush hour. Finding a parking place is also hard. The city is building many new apartment buildings. Many people do not want more people to move in. They do not want more traffic. There are many different kinds of homes in my city. Some people live in big apartments, but others live in small houses. Some homes are for one family, and others are for two families. My neighborhood is like this. There are many different kinds of people of different ages. I do not know most of my neighbors. My neighborhood is not very close anymore. But when I was a child, I played with my next-door neighbor and some other friends.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Many houses are single family homes. Some homes have been divided into two parts, but they are still connected. My home has a small front yard and a small driveway to the left. It looks like many homes here. Many houses are like a time machine to the past. People used to think living in the suburbs was a dream. But now, it is not as popular. My neighborhood is still like that. It still shows people that the dream is still alive. The people here are not as happy as they used to be. They do not take care of their yards as much. But there are still cars in the driveways. Children still play outside. A public school has been here for almost 90 years. It still looks exciting to young people. It makes older people happy too. There are few churches, but the basketball courts are always full. All of the houses look different, but they feel the same. There is a big store called \"A\" that is owned by an Arab family. They may be the only Arab family here. Most people in the neighborhood are African American. The streets are wide and the children play football. Most people have lived here for a long time. They can tell you stories about the past when everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school. But the kids stopped going there because they did not like the karate movies. Now it is a pharmacy. There is a small movie theater that shows old films at a low price. Young people do not like it because it does not show new movies. Older people like it because it is a cheap night out. There is an expressway that goes through our town. But the exit and entrance are in the next town. There was a proposal to put an exit in our town. Young people wanted it, but older people did not. They said it would ruin the town. Now, they are building a new school. We are trying to choose a mascot for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a cabin would be a good symbol for our town.",
            "You might not think this is a residential area at first. It is behind a shopping strip and not a place one usually thinks of living. But look closer. Behind an old, empty store called Whole Foods, you will find a small community. This community is not well-known to people living in the area.\n\nThere are many apartments here. They are lined up like boxes along the road. Some of these apartments have had problems in the past. We will not talk about them too much. The apartments beside them are different. They are a quiet and peaceful place that few people know about.\n\nAcross from the apartments is a small school. It is a college that teaches people who want to learn. Students go there in the morning. They are sleepy and have coffee in their hands. They open the gate slowly and quietly. Other people driving by get angry because it takes a little time. \n\nThe road goes into another street. There is a park on one side. A place to fix broken bones is on the other side. The place to fix bones has nice chairs on the porch and a big fan that moves the air. Children play in the park. They run and jump in the grass and on the swings. There is a store near the park that sells food from Japan. It is cheap, but it is not very busy. There is also a store that sells things to put in your pool, and a place to fix your nails. You can fill your pool and get a haircut all at the same time.\n\nThere is a place that sells frozen yogurt in a small shopping center. The yogurt is cold and sweet. Teenagers like it and eat it while they ride their skateboards and use a special device to make smoke. The area is a special place in America. It is a part of history in a quiet part of the country where not much changes.",
            "She asked, \"Where are we?\" as we drove past the corn fields. \"This is it!\" I said. She was from a city. She had never seen so much open space. The town where she lived had a grocery store five minutes from her house. She was surprised. I told her what it was like to grow up in the country in Ohio. In that moment, she knew who I was and where I came from.\n\nWe drove on a two-lane road. We passed a big hole in the ground filled with water. Just past it was my neighborhood. The houses are made of brick and a hard, smooth material called stucco. Each house has at least half an acre of land. People take care of their land.\n\nThere are many flowers and trees that change with the seasons. The driveways have nice cars. One of my neighbors is always outside. He is a friendly Korean man. He mows his lawn all day and sings while he works. Everyone likes him.\n\nWe will soon come to my house. There are many geese in the yard. Our dog chases them. There is a small stream in the backyard that feeds into the water-filled hole. You can hear frogs, the stream, and cows from the farms nearby. Across a small bridge is a special place with trees, herbs, and flowers that grow naturally. This is where I spent most of my childhood.\n\nI would build forts in the trees and play with my friends. In the winter, the trees look bare and the yard is empty. But sometimes it snows and the yard is filled with snow. My sister and I would make angels and snowmen. We would fight and use snowballs as our weapons. We would build big forts to store our snowballs. We would play and pretend and have no worries.",
            "Portland, Oregon is a city that likes to be different. The city's unofficial slogan is \"Keep Portland Weird\". This means that Portland likes to be a place where people can be themselves without fear of being judged. Many people think this is a good thing because it reminds us of the past when Portland was a smaller, less expensive city. It was a place where artists and musicians could live and create.\n\nToday, many new people are moving to Portland. They come from California and bring money with them. This is making changes in the city. But Portland is still a place where people can be different. We have modern things like other cities, but we also have things that are not normal. We buy many things from China, just like other cities.\n\nA neighborhood of mine is a good example of what Portland is like. We have colorful houses and gardens with flowers, herbs, and vegetables. There are also free boxes on the street in the summer. These boxes have things that people are giving away. Sometimes you can find clothes, books, or other nice things. People love to walk through this neighborhood and see what they can find.\n\nBut Portland is not perfect. We have problems with drugs and homelessness. Many people in the city do not have homes. This is a big problem in many cities, not just Portland. We have good social services, but they are not enough. Many people in the city do not know what to do about the homeless problem.\n\nWe are not weird in this way. We care about our homeless people, but we are also frustrated. We want to help, but it is hard. That is the human way. Portland is a city that is full of different people who love different things. We have goat yoga, a soccer team, and many other fun things. We also have people who love to drink and socialize. Portland is a city that is always changing, but it is still the same old weird city we love.",
            "The mountains are always there. They are in the north. They watch the sun rise and set. They do not change. They are not affected by my problems. When I am stressed, they remind me to look at them. I find peace there. I am stronger after being near them.\n\nI moved here when I first started college. The mountains near the campus were what caught my attention. The university has many nice things to see, like buildings and ponds. But the mountains are special. I like them more.\n\nThe town is also very nice. There are many small cafés where I studied and drank coffee. The downtown area is old and has many restaurants and office buildings. It is busy and fun like a big city. But it is not far from the quiet town. I can walk or take a bus to get there.\n\nThe town has two different feelings. It is fun and busy, but also quiet and peaceful. This is what makes it nice. I have many happy memories here. I walked with friends through the park after a long night of studying. I also walked through the busy downtown area to see a movie. But I also have sad memories. Sometimes I go to the pond and think about my life.\n\nOne day, I was feeling very lost. I was walking past the pond and the park. I was thinking about my purpose in life. I saw the turtles and ducks and insects living their lives. They all have a part to do. I thought about my part. I walked to a main street. The sun was shining on the palm trees. I looked up and saw the mountains. They were still there. They reminded me to be strong.",
            "If you are visiting Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you will not have trouble finding it. Many ways to get there are available. The neighborhood is urban, so you feel like you are in New York City. You will see many Asian stores. Bensonhurst has many Asian people. This is why you see an Asian store on almost every block. These stores have food, laundry services, and other things. They are very popular. Prices are low and the food is good.\n\nYou can walk to many stores and find what you need. There are four stores within two minutes of each other. This makes it easy to buy food and other things.\n\nBensonhurst is a diverse neighborhood. Many immigrants and their children live here. Many stores are owned by Asian people. But you will also see people of many other cultures.\n\nThere is a park near here. The park is nice. It has a big field for sports and playgrounds for children. People come here to play and have fun.\n\nMost people live in small houses. There are no big building like corporate offices. You may hear noise from cars when you visit. Sometimes people drive too fast and make loud music. Be careful at night because some people might cause trouble. This neighborhood is safe, but be careful.\n\nYou may see people not cleaning up after their dogs. This is a problem. You will see dog waste on the street. Be careful and keep your shoes clean.",
            "I live in a place where there are no sidewalks. My house is at the top of a big hill. People call it the \"exercise hill.\" Many people like to run up it. There is no sidewalk on my street. People walk on the road. The road is not flat and can be difficult to drive on. It is also not safe. Some wires are old and broken. They get damaged in storms. We get a lot of rain and wind. Branches fall and hit the wires. It is hard to see the power lines because they are in bad shape.\n\nThere are many tall trees around. But people do not like them. They want to cut them down because they block the view of the ocean. Many houses are built high up on the hill. They have big windows to see the ocean. It looks beautiful at sunset. The water is lit up from below and the sky turns orange. But the weather is often cloudy. You do not see the sunlight very well.\n\nIt is often damp and overcast. Moss grows on everything. I left my car outside for a month and it was covered in moss. It took me a long time to clean it. There are not many children in my neighborhood. There is a school nearby, but many people are old and retired. They often have dogs. It is common to see dogs in the yards or running in the street. If you leave a door open, they might get in. I once found a dog in my house and I had to make it leave.\n\nThere are wild rabbits in the area. They dig up plants and make holes in people's lawns. But my cats like to chase them. They have caught many rabbits. We also see small birds and hummingbirds. Sometimes a hawk or eagle comes by, but the crows chase it away. There are no stores near my house. But if you walk down to the waterfront, there are restaurants that serve fresh seafood. The rocks by the water are fun to throw into the sea. The bay is not very big. You can see the other side of the bay even when it is cloudy.",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. My house is on a quiet street between two main roads. There is some traffic, but it is not bad. I know most people in the neighborhood because not many new people move in. We have a house at the front of our street. We see all the people who come and go. We notice new cars. Some neighbors walk for exercise or with their dogs. Children ride their bikes. We work from home. There are four of us - my wife and two daughters, ages eleven and fourteen. We like to play outside, even in the rain. We also like to grill on our back deck. We hear lawn mowers often from March to October. Our neighborhood has many trees, so it is cool in the summer and colorful in the fall. We rake and burn leaves every year. I like the smell of burning leaves. We don't have much winter, so it feels like fall is very long. We open our garage door to work on our truck or projects. I like working in the garage because I feel connected to the neighborhood. Holidays are quiet here. Some families visit from out of town on holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas. I like living here. If the street were not a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is in the desert. It is very dry. There is no grass in most places. When I look around, I see only dirt. It is hard to understand how people live here unless you have tried it. Many people who live here have nice lawns. They must spend a lot of money to take care of them. When I first lived here, the houses were far apart. Now there are more houses. The neighborhood looks more like a city. But this is true for many places. Most people in my neighborhood are friendly. I like living here. There are some stores in this area. They are chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart and Final. If you want a health food store, you must go to another place. Many people in my town work in construction. This is because there is a lot of empty space for building. I work in construction too. I install drywall and T-bars. This is my full-time job. What I like about my home is the animals. People come to the desert for its beauty. The desert has many animals. We must be careful around them. My family and I like the animals. We have three children. They like lizards and desert bugs. They are outside now, trying to catch them. There are some things to see in my town. You can visit the San Bernardino County Fair. It is a fun event. You can also visit Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains. If you want to learn about the history of the desert, you can go to the Victor Valley Museum. It has many interesting things to see.",
            "My neighborhood is special. It is not like other neighborhoods. I live in a college campus. My community is the people who live in my dormitory. The campus is also my neighborhood.\n\nMy campus has housing. There are three kinds of houses. They are apartments, houses, and dorm rooms. There are many people in the apartments. Each apartment has 2-4 people. There are 4-6 rooms on each floor. The apartments are 2 stories high. About 20 people live in each building.\n\nSome houses are for rent. These houses have 2-4 bedrooms. They are usually lived in by alumni. There are not very many of these houses. They are not very efficient.\n\nDorm rooms are most common. Many students live in these rooms. Each room is shared by 2 people. Some rooms are shared by 3 people.\n\nMy campus is diverse. People from different cultures and ages live here. Some staff live in the houses. New students live in dorms. Older students live in apartments.\n\nThere are many stores on campus. They sell food, clothes, and groceries. You can buy everything you need here. There is one park. It is a playground for all the people on campus. The park is clean and safe.",
            "I have lived in this neighborhood for about 10 years. When I first came here, I was sad. I missed my old neighborhood in Riverdale. But my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to Stockbridge. Our new neighborhood was better than the old one.\n\nOver time, I got used to it and made new friends. I also made some enemies at school. I never really knew my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his children. They are nice people. I consider them like family. We had a good time at Mr. Glen's wedding. I caught a small strap that his wife took off her leg. I wish I had caught the flowers!\n\nOur neighborhood is like a maze. But now I have a GPS, so I can explore it. I like to walk in the park and enjoy nature. It makes me feel calm. I also like to practice my balance with sticks and my wooden sword. There's a basketball and tennis court in the neighborhood. My dad taught me and my best friend to play tennis. We had a lot of fun.\n\nI have many good memories in this neighborhood. I'm looking forward to more good times in the future.",
            "I live near the college I attend, and it's good for me. The neighborhood is nice. There are many apartment buildings, some small restaurants and bars. They are not expensive to visit. One of the bars changed its name. It's now more expensive, but the service is good.\n\nMost people in the neighborhood are students or lower income. They rent apartments because they are not very expensive. There is a school nearby. Many children live here. I do not know my neighbors well. They smoke a lot. The building management put a special machine to make the air smell good near their door. It's funny.\n\nThe buildings around me are old, but they have new insides. A bit down the street, there are new apartments. But I do not like them. They are not well built, but the rent is high. The city gave money to fix the road near my house. Now it's nice. There are big sidewalks, grass and trees. My apartment building is near a lot of trees. The street behind my building has many trees too. But another street, 43rd, is not as nice. The sidewalks are bad, and the buildings look old.\n\nThere are trees on that street to hide the old buildings. Many crimes happen in this area. But I like where I live. It's affordable, and there are many good things nearby. The university is near, and there are two bus stops. I can go to the store or downtown easily.",
            "My neighborhood is a group of houses. They are called duplexes. Each house is on a small street that looks like a circle. They are not in a row. They look like separate houses. They are all painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Most people are friends with each other. We stand at the end of the street some evenings. We talk and watch the children play. They play with toys, draw with chalk, or fly kites. It is nice in this world with many machines. It is like being in a different time. We are near fields and trees. The sky is blue and the clouds are white and big. \n\nBut sometimes there are warnings about a big storm. This year, we had a warning about a tornado. Last night, we heard sirens. We went to a safe place. I was in my bathtub with my little dog. I had my purse and some pillows. My big dog was in the living room. He was nervous and barking. The neighborhood was quiet. We heard the sound of hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road was hot. It was 92 degrees outside and then it dropped to 75. The hail melted when it hit the hot road. The sun came out. It started to rain. I saw a beautiful rainbow. I took a picture with my camera. I wanted to share it with my friends on Facebook. They were amazed, like me. The neighborhood was quiet for a while. Then people started coming home. They had been somewhere else when the storm happened. After that, it was like usual. Mothers and children were outside. Dinner was cooking. Our neighborhood is friendly. I like it here. I just moved here from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I like the way people talk in the South. I have a two-bedroom apartment, like everyone else. But not all apartments are the same inside. Some are very small. It is strange. I like to walk in a big field behind my house. I go to a pond that is not for swimming. I see deer and hear a big bullfrog singing in the morning. It is a great place to live. We are not far from the city of Charlotte. Each morning, we hear roosters crowing from the nearby farms. It is like living in a small village. We have a donkey at a nearby farm. He brays in the evening to say hello. I am lucky to live here.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first. But I became friends with two people who lived near me. One lived two houses down and the other on my street. They are not there anymore, but I still remember them. Most of the people who lived here when I first moved here are still here. My neighborhood is like many other suburban neighborhoods. There are many two-story houses. I hear kids playing outside on nice days. My neighborhood is quiet most days. I have never had a problem with anyone in the neighborhood. You are left alone unless you need help. I order things online and they are always safe on my porch. I trust my neighbors. There is a park near my house. I have many happy memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with other kids. I also got hurt playing football, but the good memories are stronger. Now I go to the park with my younger cousin's kids. They like to play on swings and slides. The park makes me happy. The neighborhood is different from others. We have many kinds of food nearby. You can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants within a short walk. People like to use apps for food. There are also fast food shops like McDonald's. We have many stores with everything you need. There are dry cleaners, a pharmacy, and a grocery store. Some stores are special, like one that sells Indian food. I like my neighborhood. I am thankful for it. Some people on social media have bad experiences with their neighbors. I am lucky.",
            "My neighborhood is a small town in South Carolina. It is not special, but it helps farming. Johnston is known for peaches. The town says it is the Peach Capital of the World. Most of the town is farmland with peach trees or cattle. Houses are far apart. Some are two stories high. They have metal or gray roofs to keep cool. Many houses are not near the road. They are back from the road so people can use the land for animals or crops.\n\nThere is a main part of town with a stop light. This is where the stores are. There are a few places to get food. You can go to Hong Kong for Chinese food, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's for burgers. There used to be a pizza place, but it closed.\n\nThere is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They sell Cherry Coca-Cola. The only grocery store is called IGA. People often go to Walmart in another town to buy groceries. The most popular store is Dollar General. It is busy all the time. There is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture. They deliver furniture. There is a pet store called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They take care of dogs and cats.\n\nThe doctor and vet are in small buildings away from the main part of town. There is one school in the town, Johnston Elementary. Students go to middle and high school in another town after fifth grade. The town is making a new park. It will be 2.5 acres. There is nothing to do in the town. There are no movies, bowling, or places to walk dogs. But people like the town. It is small.",
            "I first heard about my area on a podcast about people who went missing. It was surprising to me. Almost all apartments in the area cost over $1,000 per month. I had never heard of this story before and neither had my friends. I think this is the struggle. Some of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night because things are expensive. But we have learned to be careful with money. We like the smell of old toys and old clothes. When you are older, you smell less. You might start smoking or just get used to things being this way. But the flea market is always there. The smell of old magazines on a piano is strong. It stays even after you wash the piano. There are three thrift stores near me that I can walk to. If I start at the far store, I can visit two charity stores, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is busy with cars and people. But inside the thrift stores, it is quiet. Many people pass by, but you do not hear them inside the stores. It is a nice place to spend an afternoon. Each year, there are more people and cars in the city. It is growing. They say it is like New York. Everyone is busy with their own things. People do not ask many questions. You can be alone and people will leave you alone. This is different from the South, where showing concern means you care. Here, you can keep to yourself if you want. The city will move on like waves on the beach. It is a lively place. I hear music from next door and singing from upstairs. It is nice. We have a community here. We help each other when we need it. We have birthdays, funerals, and help each other out. I am lucky to live here. I like most of my neighbors and they are kind to me. I try to clean up after myself and leave food for them. They do the same. We bring mail to each other. It is nice to see them and I think they like my presence too. I live in a big, modern city. But my neighbors make me feel like I am not totally alone.",
            "I live in a typical suburban area. My neighborhood is like many others. There is a group that makes sure everything looks nice, called a homeowner's association. They take care of the homes. The yards are all similar. They have a small grass area, pretty rocks, and short driveways. Some houses have two cars. The roads are good. There are no holes in the street. Most houses are one story. Some are two stories. We don't have individual mailboxes at each house. We have a group of mailboxes at the end of the street. We use a key to get our mail. There are also two big boxes for packages.\n\nMy house is on the edge of the city. It is a mix of country and suburbs. We have a lot of space. There is a big pool and a walking path. We can walk our dogs or go for a walk. It is safe and nice here. Most people who live here are old. They take care of each other. Some younger people also live here. The city is big, but it feels small. We have many things we need. We have a big store with many things. It's not too big. It's just right. If we drive for 15 minutes, we can go anywhere. There are many stores. We have good food stores and cheap stores. My neighborhood is safe and nice. We have good things like pools and walking paths. We can easily get to any store we want.",
            "I live in a small town in the middle of the United States. Our town is near a big city, but not too close. My neighborhood is on the east side of town. It is not rich, but it is not bad either. The houses are not very valuable, and most people rent or own them. However, it is not ugly or unpleasant. My neighbors are kind people who say hello when I walk by.\n\nThere are sometimes problems in our town. There is more crime here than in other parts of town. There have been a few violent crimes near my house in the past ten years. One time, our neighbors lost their son in a shooting near a bar. But we have not been directly affected by crime. Sometimes, things go missing from our porch if we leave them outside.\n\nOur town has a big problem with a disease called addiction. Many people have died from overdoses. But we have help for people who need it. There are special places to get treatment and trainings to help families and friends.\n\nDespite the problems, our town has many good things. My son's school is very good. The teachers and staff are kind and help him. My son is special, but nobody bothers him at school. The school is a happy place. They have many events to help families and students. They also give free food to all students so they do not go hungry.\n\nOur town is improving, but not all parts are the same. The center of town and the west side are nicer. They have new roads and parks. But the east side, where I live, needs help. I like living here because people are friendly, the schools are good, and we have many stores to buy things. Our home is not worth a lot, but it is comfortable.\n\nWe have lived here for 16 years, and we do not want to leave.",
            "My neighborhood is special. It's on a hill. There are old buildings around me. I live in a 7-story apartment building near an old theater. A block away is a fun arcade bar. Many different kinds of people go there on warm summer nights. There is a long line to get in sometimes. A big park is nearby. It's large for our area. The park is surrounded by concrete. It has big stairs. In winter, homeless people set up tents on the sidewalk and stairs. This keeps them warm. They are close to a place where they can take a bath and wash clothes.\n\nI love my neighborhood. It's not the old buildings that make it special. It's the people. Our neighborhood was once very bad. There were many gangs. The government tried to clean it up. People remember this. They still tell stories. The people here work hard to keep the neighborhood clean. They care about their city and block.\n\nSome people say it's not safe to walk around here at night if you are white. I think this is not true. I'm a little dark. People here see me as one of them. They are kind to me. They gave me a jacket when I needed it. They let me charge my phone when it was raining. They told me I'm beautiful. This is my home. I feel happy walking here at night. I meet nice people who don't try to hurt me.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan. It is a rural area. Farmland and small cities are near each other here. There are no big shopping centers or well-known stores. If you need something, you have to drive to get it.\n\nDespite this, my town is very beautiful. It is next to two large lakes. Beautiful Lake Michigan is on one side and a smaller lake called Lake Charlevoix is on the other. Every place you go, you can find a beach where you can put your feet in the water.\n\nMy neighborhood is a small town neighborhood. Houses are not close together. They are not the same. Some houses are old and some are new. Most houses have basements. You can see them from the street. Many houses have old aluminum siding. The houses in my neighborhood are different colors. Most houses have yards. There are trampolines, playsets, and gardens in the yards. Some people have fences for their animals.\n\nMy neighborhood is like the kind of place people want to live. Many people work hard to make a living. Some are raising families. You can see kids playing outside every day. You can also see people walking dogs, riding bikes, or rollerblading. Neighbors know each other. If someone is new, you can tell. People are friendly. They wave to each other. The lawns are well taken care of. People keep the grass cut and leaves are not on the ground. Plants and bushes are trimmed.\n\nIt is not a very beautiful neighborhood that you drive by and think \"wow.\" It is a safe and quiet place. It is a good place to raise a family. You can walk to the county sheriff's department and the health department. There is a recycling center near by. People use these services. We have baseball and softball fields where you can hear the announcers. Our small town airport is near the fields. You can hear the sound of small planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream or go downtown from my neighborhood. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, which is just a few blocks away. It is a great place to live."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "I live in a big city. My neighborhood is different. There are homes and businesses close together. Some areas are for homes, and others are for stores, restaurants, and fun places. There are many new places to eat and shop. Some stores are big and well-known, but small stores are also popular. These small stores are in malls and on the street. The streets are close to quiet neighborhoods.\n\nThere are parks near my home. People go to these parks with their young children. My neighborhood is also very diverse. There are many different kinds of people. In one area, there is a group of people who are LGBTQ+. There is also a Jewish community and a group of people from the former Soviet Union. Outside my neighborhood, there are many more people from different countries. They live in areas called Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia. However, these places are far apart. It takes a long time to drive between them.\n\nMy city is very big. People do not usually walk. Traffic is very bad. It takes a long time to drive anywhere, especially during rush hour. Finding a parking place is also hard. The city is building many new apartment buildings. Many people do not want more people to move in. They do not want more traffic. There are many different kinds of homes in my city. Some people live in big apartments, but others live in small houses. Some homes are for one family, and others are for two families. My neighborhood is like this. There are many different kinds of people of different ages. I do not know most of my neighbors. My neighborhood is not very close anymore. But when I was a child, I played with my next-door neighbor and some other friends.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Many houses are single family homes. Some homes have been divided into two parts, but they are still connected. My home has a small front yard and a small driveway to the left. It looks like many homes here. Many houses are like a time machine to the past. People used to think living in the suburbs was a dream. But now, it is not as popular. My neighborhood is still like that. It still shows people that the dream is still alive. The people here are not as happy as they used to be. They do not take care of their yards as much. But there are still cars in the driveways. Children still play outside. A public school has been here for almost 90 years. It still looks exciting to young people. It makes older people happy too. There are few churches, but the basketball courts are always full. All of the houses look different, but they feel the same. There is a big store called \"A\" that is owned by an Arab family. They may be the only Arab family here. Most people in the neighborhood are African American. The streets are wide and the children play football. Most people have lived here for a long time. They can tell you stories about the past when everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school. But the kids stopped going there because they did not like the karate movies. Now it is a pharmacy. There is a small movie theater that shows old films at a low price. Young people do not like it because it does not show new movies. Older people like it because it is a cheap night out. There is an expressway that goes through our town. But the exit and entrance are in the next town. There was a proposal to put an exit in our town. Young people wanted it, but older people did not. They said it would ruin the town. Now, they are building a new school. We are trying to choose a mascot for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a cabin would be a good symbol for our town.",
            "You might not think this is a residential area at first. It is behind a shopping strip and not a place one usually thinks of living. But look closer. Behind an old, empty store called Whole Foods, you will find a small community. This community is not well-known to people living in the area.\n\nThere are many apartments here. They are lined up like boxes along the road. Some of these apartments have had problems in the past. We will not talk about them too much. The apartments beside them are different. They are a quiet and peaceful place that few people know about.\n\nAcross from the apartments is a small school. It is a college that teaches people who want to learn. Students go there in the morning. They are sleepy and have coffee in their hands. They open the gate slowly and quietly. Other people driving by get angry because it takes a little time. \n\nThe road goes into another street. There is a park on one side. A place to fix broken bones is on the other side. The place to fix bones has nice chairs on the porch and a big fan that moves the air. Children play in the park. They run and jump in the grass and on the swings. There is a store near the park that sells food from Japan. It is cheap, but it is not very busy. There is also a store that sells things to put in your pool, and a place to fix your nails. You can fill your pool and get a haircut all at the same time.\n\nThere is a place that sells frozen yogurt in a small shopping center. The yogurt is cold and sweet. Teenagers like it and eat it while they ride their skateboards and use a special device to make smoke. The area is a special place in America. It is a part of history in a quiet part of the country where not much changes.",
            "She asked, \"Where are we?\" as we drove past the corn fields. \"This is it!\" I said. She was from a city. She had never seen so much open space. The town where she lived had a grocery store five minutes from her house. She was surprised. I told her what it was like to grow up in the country in Ohio. In that moment, she knew who I was and where I came from.\n\nWe drove on a two-lane road. We passed a big hole in the ground filled with water. Just past it was my neighborhood. The houses are made of brick and a hard, smooth material called stucco. Each house has at least half an acre of land. People take care of their land.\n\nThere are many flowers and trees that change with the seasons. The driveways have nice cars. One of my neighbors is always outside. He is a friendly Korean man. He mows his lawn all day and sings while he works. Everyone likes him.\n\nWe will soon come to my house. There are many geese in the yard. Our dog chases them. There is a small stream in the backyard that feeds into the water-filled hole. You can hear frogs, the stream, and cows from the farms nearby. Across a small bridge is a special place with trees, herbs, and flowers that grow naturally. This is where I spent most of my childhood.\n\nI would build forts in the trees and play with my friends. In the winter, the trees look bare and the yard is empty. But sometimes it snows and the yard is filled with snow. My sister and I would make angels and snowmen. We would fight and use snowballs as our weapons. We would build big forts to store our snowballs. We would play and pretend and have no worries.",
            "Portland, Oregon is a city that likes to be different. The city's unofficial slogan is \"Keep Portland Weird\". This means that Portland likes to be a place where people can be themselves without fear of being judged. Many people think this is a good thing because it reminds us of the past when Portland was a smaller, less expensive city. It was a place where artists and musicians could live and create.\n\nToday, many new people are moving to Portland. They come from California and bring money with them. This is making changes in the city. But Portland is still a place where people can be different. We have modern things like other cities, but we also have things that are not normal. We buy many things from China, just like other cities.\n\nA neighborhood of mine is a good example of what Portland is like. We have colorful houses and gardens with flowers, herbs, and vegetables. There are also free boxes on the street in the summer. These boxes have things that people are giving away. Sometimes you can find clothes, books, or other nice things. People love to walk through this neighborhood and see what they can find.\n\nBut Portland is not perfect. We have problems with drugs and homelessness. Many people in the city do not have homes. This is a big problem in many cities, not just Portland. We have good social services, but they are not enough. Many people in the city do not know what to do about the homeless problem.\n\nWe are not weird in this way. We care about our homeless people, but we are also frustrated. We want to help, but it is hard. That is the human way. Portland is a city that is full of different people who love different things. We have goat yoga, a soccer team, and many other fun things. We also have people who love to drink and socialize. Portland is a city that is always changing, but it is still the same old weird city we love.",
            "The mountains are always there. They are in the north. They watch the sun rise and set. They do not change. They are not affected by my problems. When I am stressed, they remind me to look at them. I find peace there. I am stronger after being near them.\n\nI moved here when I first started college. The mountains near the campus were what caught my attention. The university has many nice things to see, like buildings and ponds. But the mountains are special. I like them more.\n\nThe town is also very nice. There are many small cafés where I studied and drank coffee. The downtown area is old and has many restaurants and office buildings. It is busy and fun like a big city. But it is not far from the quiet town. I can walk or take a bus to get there.\n\nThe town has two different feelings. It is fun and busy, but also quiet and peaceful. This is what makes it nice. I have many happy memories here. I walked with friends through the park after a long night of studying. I also walked through the busy downtown area to see a movie. But I also have sad memories. Sometimes I go to the pond and think about my life.\n\nOne day, I was feeling very lost. I was walking past the pond and the park. I was thinking about my purpose in life. I saw the turtles and ducks and insects living their lives. They all have a part to do. I thought about my part. I walked to a main street. The sun was shining on the palm trees. I looked up and saw the mountains. They were still there. They reminded me to be strong.",
            "If you are visiting Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you will not have trouble finding it. Many ways to get there are available. The neighborhood is urban, so you feel like you are in New York City. You will see many Asian stores. Bensonhurst has many Asian people. This is why you see an Asian store on almost every block. These stores have food, laundry services, and other things. They are very popular. Prices are low and the food is good.\n\nYou can walk to many stores and find what you need. There are four stores within two minutes of each other. This makes it easy to buy food and other things.\n\nBensonhurst is a diverse neighborhood. Many immigrants and their children live here. Many stores are owned by Asian people. But you will also see people of many other cultures.\n\nThere is a park near here. The park is nice. It has a big field for sports and playgrounds for children. People come here to play and have fun.\n\nMost people live in small houses. There are no big building like corporate offices. You may hear noise from cars when you visit. Sometimes people drive too fast and make loud music. Be careful at night because some people might cause trouble. This neighborhood is safe, but be careful.\n\nYou may see people not cleaning up after their dogs. This is a problem. You will see dog waste on the street. Be careful and keep your shoes clean.",
            "I live in a place where there are no sidewalks. My house is at the top of a big hill. People call it the \"exercise hill.\" Many people like to run up it. There is no sidewalk on my street. People walk on the road. The road is not flat and can be difficult to drive on. It is also not safe. Some wires are old and broken. They get damaged in storms. We get a lot of rain and wind. Branches fall and hit the wires. It is hard to see the power lines because they are in bad shape.\n\nThere are many tall trees around. But people do not like them. They want to cut them down because they block the view of the ocean. Many houses are built high up on the hill. They have big windows to see the ocean. It looks beautiful at sunset. The water is lit up from below and the sky turns orange. But the weather is often cloudy. You do not see the sunlight very well.\n\nIt is often damp and overcast. Moss grows on everything. I left my car outside for a month and it was covered in moss. It took me a long time to clean it. There are not many children in my neighborhood. There is a school nearby, but many people are old and retired. They often have dogs. It is common to see dogs in the yards or running in the street. If you leave a door open, they might get in. I once found a dog in my house and I had to make it leave.\n\nThere are wild rabbits in the area. They dig up plants and make holes in people's lawns. But my cats like to chase them. They have caught many rabbits. We also see small birds and hummingbirds. Sometimes a hawk or eagle comes by, but the crows chase it away. There are no stores near my house. But if you walk down to the waterfront, there are restaurants that serve fresh seafood. The rocks by the water are fun to throw into the sea. The bay is not very big. You can see the other side of the bay even when it is cloudy.",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. My house is on a quiet street between two main roads. There is some traffic, but it is not bad. I know most people in the neighborhood because not many new people move in. We have a house at the front of our street. We see all the people who come and go. We notice new cars. Some neighbors walk for exercise or with their dogs. Children ride their bikes. We work from home. There are four of us - my wife and two daughters, ages eleven and fourteen. We like to play outside, even in the rain. We also like to grill on our back deck. We hear lawn mowers often from March to October. Our neighborhood has many trees, so it is cool in the summer and colorful in the fall. We rake and burn leaves every year. I like the smell of burning leaves. We don't have much winter, so it feels like fall is very long. We open our garage door to work on our truck or projects. I like working in the garage because I feel connected to the neighborhood. Holidays are quiet here. Some families visit from out of town on holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas. I like living here. If the street were not a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is in the desert. It is very dry. There is no grass in most places. When I look around, I see only dirt. It is hard to understand how people live here unless you have tried it. Many people who live here have nice lawns. They must spend a lot of money to take care of them. When I first lived here, the houses were far apart. Now there are more houses. The neighborhood looks more like a city. But this is true for many places. Most people in my neighborhood are friendly. I like living here. There are some stores in this area. They are chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart and Final. If you want a health food store, you must go to another place. Many people in my town work in construction. This is because there is a lot of empty space for building. I work in construction too. I install drywall and T-bars. This is my full-time job. What I like about my home is the animals. People come to the desert for its beauty. The desert has many animals. We must be careful around them. My family and I like the animals. We have three children. They like lizards and desert bugs. They are outside now, trying to catch them. There are some things to see in my town. You can visit the San Bernardino County Fair. It is a fun event. You can also visit Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains. If you want to learn about the history of the desert, you can go to the Victor Valley Museum. It has many interesting things to see.",
            "My neighborhood is special. It is not like other neighborhoods. I live in a college campus. My community is the people who live in my dormitory. The campus is also my neighborhood.\n\nMy campus has housing. There are three kinds of houses. They are apartments, houses, and dorm rooms. There are many people in the apartments. Each apartment has 2-4 people. There are 4-6 rooms on each floor. The apartments are 2 stories high. About 20 people live in each building.\n\nSome houses are for rent. These houses have 2-4 bedrooms. They are usually lived in by alumni. There are not very many of these houses. They are not very efficient.\n\nDorm rooms are most common. Many students live in these rooms. Each room is shared by 2 people. Some rooms are shared by 3 people.\n\nMy campus is diverse. People from different cultures and ages live here. Some staff live in the houses. New students live in dorms. Older students live in apartments.\n\nThere are many stores on campus. They sell food, clothes, and groceries. You can buy everything you need here. There is one park. It is a playground for all the people on campus. The park is clean and safe.",
            "I have lived in this neighborhood for about 10 years. When I first came here, I was sad. I missed my old neighborhood in Riverdale. But my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to Stockbridge. Our new neighborhood was better than the old one.\n\nOver time, I got used to it and made new friends. I also made some enemies at school. I never really knew my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his children. They are nice people. I consider them like family. We had a good time at Mr. Glen's wedding. I caught a small strap that his wife took off her leg. I wish I had caught the flowers!\n\nOur neighborhood is like a maze. But now I have a GPS, so I can explore it. I like to walk in the park and enjoy nature. It makes me feel calm. I also like to practice my balance with sticks and my wooden sword. There's a basketball and tennis court in the neighborhood. My dad taught me and my best friend to play tennis. We had a lot of fun.\n\nI have many good memories in this neighborhood. I'm looking forward to more good times in the future.",
            "I live near the college I attend, and it's good for me. The neighborhood is nice. There are many apartment buildings, some small restaurants and bars. They are not expensive to visit. One of the bars changed its name. It's now more expensive, but the service is good.\n\nMost people in the neighborhood are students or lower income. They rent apartments because they are not very expensive. There is a school nearby. Many children live here. I do not know my neighbors well. They smoke a lot. The building management put a special machine to make the air smell good near their door. It's funny.\n\nThe buildings around me are old, but they have new insides. A bit down the street, there are new apartments. But I do not like them. They are not well built, but the rent is high. The city gave money to fix the road near my house. Now it's nice. There are big sidewalks, grass and trees. My apartment building is near a lot of trees. The street behind my building has many trees too. But another street, 43rd, is not as nice. The sidewalks are bad, and the buildings look old.\n\nThere are trees on that street to hide the old buildings. Many crimes happen in this area. But I like where I live. It's affordable, and there are many good things nearby. The university is near, and there are two bus stops. I can go to the store or downtown easily.",
            "My neighborhood is a group of houses. They are called duplexes. Each house is on a small street that looks like a circle. They are not in a row. They look like separate houses. They are all painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Most people are friends with each other. We stand at the end of the street some evenings. We talk and watch the children play. They play with toys, draw with chalk, or fly kites. It is nice in this world with many machines. It is like being in a different time. We are near fields and trees. The sky is blue and the clouds are white and big. \n\nBut sometimes there are warnings about a big storm. This year, we had a warning about a tornado. Last night, we heard sirens. We went to a safe place. I was in my bathtub with my little dog. I had my purse and some pillows. My big dog was in the living room. He was nervous and barking. The neighborhood was quiet. We heard the sound of hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road was hot. It was 92 degrees outside and then it dropped to 75. The hail melted when it hit the hot road. The sun came out. It started to rain. I saw a beautiful rainbow. I took a picture with my camera. I wanted to share it with my friends on Facebook. They were amazed, like me. The neighborhood was quiet for a while. Then people started coming home. They had been somewhere else when the storm happened. After that, it was like usual. Mothers and children were outside. Dinner was cooking. Our neighborhood is friendly. I like it here. I just moved here from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I like the way people talk in the South. I have a two-bedroom apartment, like everyone else. But not all apartments are the same inside. Some are very small. It is strange. I like to walk in a big field behind my house. I go to a pond that is not for swimming. I see deer and hear a big bullfrog singing in the morning. It is a great place to live. We are not far from the city of Charlotte. Each morning, we hear roosters crowing from the nearby farms. It is like living in a small village. We have a donkey at a nearby farm. He brays in the evening to say hello. I am lucky to live here.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first. But I became friends with two people who lived near me. One lived two houses down and the other on my street. They are not there anymore, but I still remember them. Most of the people who lived here when I first moved here are still here. My neighborhood is like many other suburban neighborhoods. There are many two-story houses. I hear kids playing outside on nice days. My neighborhood is quiet most days. I have never had a problem with anyone in the neighborhood. You are left alone unless you need help. I order things online and they are always safe on my porch. I trust my neighbors. There is a park near my house. I have many happy memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with other kids. I also got hurt playing football, but the good memories are stronger. Now I go to the park with my younger cousin's kids. They like to play on swings and slides. The park makes me happy. The neighborhood is different from others. We have many kinds of food nearby. You can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants within a short walk. People like to use apps for food. There are also fast food shops like McDonald's. We have many stores with everything you need. There are dry cleaners, a pharmacy, and a grocery store. Some stores are special, like one that sells Indian food. I like my neighborhood. I am thankful for it. Some people on social media have bad experiences with their neighbors. I am lucky.",
            "My neighborhood is a small town in South Carolina. It is not special, but it helps farming. Johnston is known for peaches. The town says it is the Peach Capital of the World. Most of the town is farmland with peach trees or cattle. Houses are far apart. Some are two stories high. They have metal or gray roofs to keep cool. Many houses are not near the road. They are back from the road so people can use the land for animals or crops.\n\nThere is a main part of town with a stop light. This is where the stores are. There are a few places to get food. You can go to Hong Kong for Chinese food, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's for burgers. There used to be a pizza place, but it closed.\n\nThere is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They sell Cherry Coca-Cola. The only grocery store is called IGA. People often go to Walmart in another town to buy groceries. The most popular store is Dollar General. It is busy all the time. There is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture. They deliver furniture. There is a pet store called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They take care of dogs and cats.\n\nThe doctor and vet are in small buildings away from the main part of town. There is one school in the town, Johnston Elementary. Students go to middle and high school in another town after fifth grade. The town is making a new park. It will be 2.5 acres. There is nothing to do in the town. There are no movies, bowling, or places to walk dogs. But people like the town. It is small.",
            "I first heard about my area on a podcast about people who went missing. It was surprising to me. Almost all apartments in the area cost over $1,000 per month. I had never heard of this story before and neither had my friends. I think this is the struggle. Some of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night because things are expensive. But we have learned to be careful with money. We like the smell of old toys and old clothes. When you are older, you smell less. You might start smoking or just get used to things being this way. But the flea market is always there. The smell of old magazines on a piano is strong. It stays even after you wash the piano. There are three thrift stores near me that I can walk to. If I start at the far store, I can visit two charity stores, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is busy with cars and people. But inside the thrift stores, it is quiet. Many people pass by, but you do not hear them inside the stores. It is a nice place to spend an afternoon. Each year, there are more people and cars in the city. It is growing. They say it is like New York. Everyone is busy with their own things. People do not ask many questions. You can be alone and people will leave you alone. This is different from the South, where showing concern means you care. Here, you can keep to yourself if you want. The city will move on like waves on the beach. It is a lively place. I hear music from next door and singing from upstairs. It is nice. We have a community here. We help each other when we need it. We have birthdays, funerals, and help each other out. I am lucky to live here. I like most of my neighbors and they are kind to me. I try to clean up after myself and leave food for them. They do the same. We bring mail to each other. It is nice to see them and I think they like my presence too. I live in a big, modern city. But my neighbors make me feel like I am not totally alone.",
            "I live in a typical suburban area. My neighborhood is like many others. There is a group that makes sure everything looks nice, called a homeowner's association. They take care of the homes. The yards are all similar. They have a small grass area, pretty rocks, and short driveways. Some houses have two cars. The roads are good. There are no holes in the street. Most houses are one story. Some are two stories. We don't have individual mailboxes at each house. We have a group of mailboxes at the end of the street. We use a key to get our mail. There are also two big boxes for packages.\n\nMy house is on the edge of the city. It is a mix of country and suburbs. We have a lot of space. There is a big pool and a walking path. We can walk our dogs or go for a walk. It is safe and nice here. Most people who live here are old. They take care of each other. Some younger people also live here. The city is big, but it feels small. We have many things we need. We have a big store with many things. It's not too big. It's just right. If we drive for 15 minutes, we can go anywhere. There are many stores. We have good food stores and cheap stores. My neighborhood is safe and nice. We have good things like pools and walking paths. We can easily get to any store we want.",
            "I live in a small town in the middle of the United States. Our town is near a big city, but not too close. My neighborhood is on the east side of town. It is not rich, but it is not bad either. The houses are not very valuable, and most people rent or own them. However, it is not ugly or unpleasant. My neighbors are kind people who say hello when I walk by.\n\nThere are sometimes problems in our town. There is more crime here than in other parts of town. There have been a few violent crimes near my house in the past ten years. One time, our neighbors lost their son in a shooting near a bar. But we have not been directly affected by crime. Sometimes, things go missing from our porch if we leave them outside.\n\nOur town has a big problem with a disease called addiction. Many people have died from overdoses. But we have help for people who need it. There are special places to get treatment and trainings to help families and friends.\n\nDespite the problems, our town has many good things. My son's school is very good. The teachers and staff are kind and help him. My son is special, but nobody bothers him at school. The school is a happy place. They have many events to help families and students. They also give free food to all students so they do not go hungry.\n\nOur town is improving, but not all parts are the same. The center of town and the west side are nicer. They have new roads and parks. But the east side, where I live, needs help. I like living here because people are friendly, the schools are good, and we have many stores to buy things. Our home is not worth a lot, but it is comfortable.\n\nWe have lived here for 16 years, and we do not want to leave.",
            "My neighborhood is special. It's on a hill. There are old buildings around me. I live in a 7-story apartment building near an old theater. A block away is a fun arcade bar. Many different kinds of people go there on warm summer nights. There is a long line to get in sometimes. A big park is nearby. It's large for our area. The park is surrounded by concrete. It has big stairs. In winter, homeless people set up tents on the sidewalk and stairs. This keeps them warm. They are close to a place where they can take a bath and wash clothes.\n\nI love my neighborhood. It's not the old buildings that make it special. It's the people. Our neighborhood was once very bad. There were many gangs. The government tried to clean it up. People remember this. They still tell stories. The people here work hard to keep the neighborhood clean. They care about their city and block.\n\nSome people say it's not safe to walk around here at night if you are white. I think this is not true. I'm a little dark. People here see me as one of them. They are kind to me. They gave me a jacket when I needed it. They let me charge my phone when it was raining. They told me I'm beautiful. This is my home. I feel happy walking here at night. I meet nice people who don't try to hurt me.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan. It is a rural area. Farmland and small cities are near each other here. There are no big shopping centers or well-known stores. If you need something, you have to drive to get it.\n\nDespite this, my town is very beautiful. It is next to two large lakes. Beautiful Lake Michigan is on one side and a smaller lake called Lake Charlevoix is on the other. Every place you go, you can find a beach where you can put your feet in the water.\n\nMy neighborhood is a small town neighborhood. Houses are not close together. They are not the same. Some houses are old and some are new. Most houses have basements. You can see them from the street. Many houses have old aluminum siding. The houses in my neighborhood are different colors. Most houses have yards. There are trampolines, playsets, and gardens in the yards. Some people have fences for their animals.\n\nMy neighborhood is like the kind of place people want to live. Many people work hard to make a living. Some are raising families. You can see kids playing outside every day. You can also see people walking dogs, riding bikes, or rollerblading. Neighbors know each other. If someone is new, you can tell. People are friendly. They wave to each other. The lawns are well taken care of. People keep the grass cut and leaves are not on the ground. Plants and bushes are trimmed.\n\nIt is not a very beautiful neighborhood that you drive by and think \"wow.\" It is a safe and quiet place. It is a good place to raise a family. You can walk to the county sheriff's department and the health department. There is a recycling center near by. People use these services. We have baseball and softball fields where you can hear the announcers. Our small town airport is near the fields. You can hear the sound of small planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream or go downtown from my neighborhood. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, which is just a few blocks away. It is a great place to live."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "I live in a big city. My neighborhood is different. There are homes and businesses close together. Some areas are for homes, and others are for stores, restaurants, and fun places. There are many new places to eat and shop. Some stores are big and well-known, but small stores are also popular. These small stores are in malls and on the street. The streets are close to quiet neighborhoods.\n\nThere are parks near my home. People go to these parks with their young children. My neighborhood is also very diverse. There are many different kinds of people. In one area, there is a group of people who are LGBTQ+. There is also a Jewish community and a group of people from the former Soviet Union. Outside my neighborhood, there are many more people from different countries. They live in areas called Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia. However, these places are far apart. It takes a long time to drive between them.\n\nMy city is very big. People do not usually walk. Traffic is very bad. It takes a long time to drive anywhere, especially during rush hour. Finding a parking place is also hard. The city is building many new apartment buildings. Many people do not want more people to move in. They do not want more traffic. There are many different kinds of homes in my city. Some people live in big apartments, but others live in small houses. Some homes are for one family, and others are for two families. My neighborhood is like this. There are many different kinds of people of different ages. I do not know most of my neighbors. My neighborhood is not very close anymore. But when I was a child, I played with my next-door neighbor and some other friends.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Many houses are single family homes. Some homes have been divided into two parts, but they are still connected. My home has a small front yard and a small driveway to the left. It looks like many homes here. Many houses are like a time machine to the past. People used to think living in the suburbs was a dream. But now, it is not as popular. My neighborhood is still like that. It still shows people that the dream is still alive. The people here are not as happy as they used to be. They do not take care of their yards as much. But there are still cars in the driveways. Children still play outside. A public school has been here for almost 90 years. It still looks exciting to young people. It makes older people happy too. There are few churches, but the basketball courts are always full. All of the houses look different, but they feel the same. There is a big store called \"A\" that is owned by an Arab family. They may be the only Arab family here. Most people in the neighborhood are African American. The streets are wide and the children play football. Most people have lived here for a long time. They can tell you stories about the past when everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school. But the kids stopped going there because they did not like the karate movies. Now it is a pharmacy. There is a small movie theater that shows old films at a low price. Young people do not like it because it does not show new movies. Older people like it because it is a cheap night out. There is an expressway that goes through our town. But the exit and entrance are in the next town. There was a proposal to put an exit in our town. Young people wanted it, but older people did not. They said it would ruin the town. Now, they are building a new school. We are trying to choose a mascot for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a cabin would be a good symbol for our town.",
            "You might not think this is a residential area at first. It is behind a shopping strip and not a place one usually thinks of living. But look closer. Behind an old, empty store called Whole Foods, you will find a small community. This community is not well-known to people living in the area.\n\nThere are many apartments here. They are lined up like boxes along the road. Some of these apartments have had problems in the past. We will not talk about them too much. The apartments beside them are different. They are a quiet and peaceful place that few people know about.\n\nAcross from the apartments is a small school. It is a college that teaches people who want to learn. Students go there in the morning. They are sleepy and have coffee in their hands. They open the gate slowly and quietly. Other people driving by get angry because it takes a little time. \n\nThe road goes into another street. There is a park on one side. A place to fix broken bones is on the other side. The place to fix bones has nice chairs on the porch and a big fan that moves the air. Children play in the park. They run and jump in the grass and on the swings. There is a store near the park that sells food from Japan. It is cheap, but it is not very busy. There is also a store that sells things to put in your pool, and a place to fix your nails. You can fill your pool and get a haircut all at the same time.\n\nThere is a place that sells frozen yogurt in a small shopping center. The yogurt is cold and sweet. Teenagers like it and eat it while they ride their skateboards and use a special device to make smoke. The area is a special place in America. It is a part of history in a quiet part of the country where not much changes.",
            "She asked, \"Where are we?\" as we drove past the corn fields. \"This is it!\" I said. She was from a city. She had never seen so much open space. The town where she lived had a grocery store five minutes from her house. She was surprised. I told her what it was like to grow up in the country in Ohio. In that moment, she knew who I was and where I came from.\n\nWe drove on a two-lane road. We passed a big hole in the ground filled with water. Just past it was my neighborhood. The houses are made of brick and a hard, smooth material called stucco. Each house has at least half an acre of land. People take care of their land.\n\nThere are many flowers and trees that change with the seasons. The driveways have nice cars. One of my neighbors is always outside. He is a friendly Korean man. He mows his lawn all day and sings while he works. Everyone likes him.\n\nWe will soon come to my house. There are many geese in the yard. Our dog chases them. There is a small stream in the backyard that feeds into the water-filled hole. You can hear frogs, the stream, and cows from the farms nearby. Across a small bridge is a special place with trees, herbs, and flowers that grow naturally. This is where I spent most of my childhood.\n\nI would build forts in the trees and play with my friends. In the winter, the trees look bare and the yard is empty. But sometimes it snows and the yard is filled with snow. My sister and I would make angels and snowmen. We would fight and use snowballs as our weapons. We would build big forts to store our snowballs. We would play and pretend and have no worries.",
            "Portland, Oregon is a city that likes to be different. The city's unofficial slogan is \"Keep Portland Weird\". This means that Portland likes to be a place where people can be themselves without fear of being judged. Many people think this is a good thing because it reminds us of the past when Portland was a smaller, less expensive city. It was a place where artists and musicians could live and create.\n\nToday, many new people are moving to Portland. They come from California and bring money with them. This is making changes in the city. But Portland is still a place where people can be different. We have modern things like other cities, but we also have things that are not normal. We buy many things from China, just like other cities.\n\nA neighborhood of mine is a good example of what Portland is like. We have colorful houses and gardens with flowers, herbs, and vegetables. There are also free boxes on the street in the summer. These boxes have things that people are giving away. Sometimes you can find clothes, books, or other nice things. People love to walk through this neighborhood and see what they can find.\n\nBut Portland is not perfect. We have problems with drugs and homelessness. Many people in the city do not have homes. This is a big problem in many cities, not just Portland. We have good social services, but they are not enough. Many people in the city do not know what to do about the homeless problem.\n\nWe are not weird in this way. We care about our homeless people, but we are also frustrated. We want to help, but it is hard. That is the human way. Portland is a city that is full of different people who love different things. We have goat yoga, a soccer team, and many other fun things. We also have people who love to drink and socialize. Portland is a city that is always changing, but it is still the same old weird city we love.",
            "The mountains are always there. They are in the north. They watch the sun rise and set. They do not change. They are not affected by my problems. When I am stressed, they remind me to look at them. I find peace there. I am stronger after being near them.\n\nI moved here when I first started college. The mountains near the campus were what caught my attention. The university has many nice things to see, like buildings and ponds. But the mountains are special. I like them more.\n\nThe town is also very nice. There are many small cafés where I studied and drank coffee. The downtown area is old and has many restaurants and office buildings. It is busy and fun like a big city. But it is not far from the quiet town. I can walk or take a bus to get there.\n\nThe town has two different feelings. It is fun and busy, but also quiet and peaceful. This is what makes it nice. I have many happy memories here. I walked with friends through the park after a long night of studying. I also walked through the busy downtown area to see a movie. But I also have sad memories. Sometimes I go to the pond and think about my life.\n\nOne day, I was feeling very lost. I was walking past the pond and the park. I was thinking about my purpose in life. I saw the turtles and ducks and insects living their lives. They all have a part to do. I thought about my part. I walked to a main street. The sun was shining on the palm trees. I looked up and saw the mountains. They were still there. They reminded me to be strong.",
            "If you are visiting Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you will not have trouble finding it. Many ways to get there are available. The neighborhood is urban, so you feel like you are in New York City. You will see many Asian stores. Bensonhurst has many Asian people. This is why you see an Asian store on almost every block. These stores have food, laundry services, and other things. They are very popular. Prices are low and the food is good.\n\nYou can walk to many stores and find what you need. There are four stores within two minutes of each other. This makes it easy to buy food and other things.\n\nBensonhurst is a diverse neighborhood. Many immigrants and their children live here. Many stores are owned by Asian people. But you will also see people of many other cultures.\n\nThere is a park near here. The park is nice. It has a big field for sports and playgrounds for children. People come here to play and have fun.\n\nMost people live in small houses. There are no big building like corporate offices. You may hear noise from cars when you visit. Sometimes people drive too fast and make loud music. Be careful at night because some people might cause trouble. This neighborhood is safe, but be careful.\n\nYou may see people not cleaning up after their dogs. This is a problem. You will see dog waste on the street. Be careful and keep your shoes clean.",
            "I live in a place where there are no sidewalks. My house is at the top of a big hill. People call it the \"exercise hill.\" Many people like to run up it. There is no sidewalk on my street. People walk on the road. The road is not flat and can be difficult to drive on. It is also not safe. Some wires are old and broken. They get damaged in storms. We get a lot of rain and wind. Branches fall and hit the wires. It is hard to see the power lines because they are in bad shape.\n\nThere are many tall trees around. But people do not like them. They want to cut them down because they block the view of the ocean. Many houses are built high up on the hill. They have big windows to see the ocean. It looks beautiful at sunset. The water is lit up from below and the sky turns orange. But the weather is often cloudy. You do not see the sunlight very well.\n\nIt is often damp and overcast. Moss grows on everything. I left my car outside for a month and it was covered in moss. It took me a long time to clean it. There are not many children in my neighborhood. There is a school nearby, but many people are old and retired. They often have dogs. It is common to see dogs in the yards or running in the street. If you leave a door open, they might get in. I once found a dog in my house and I had to make it leave.\n\nThere are wild rabbits in the area. They dig up plants and make holes in people's lawns. But my cats like to chase them. They have caught many rabbits. We also see small birds and hummingbirds. Sometimes a hawk or eagle comes by, but the crows chase it away. There are no stores near my house. But if you walk down to the waterfront, there are restaurants that serve fresh seafood. The rocks by the water are fun to throw into the sea. The bay is not very big. You can see the other side of the bay even when it is cloudy.",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. My house is on a quiet street between two main roads. There is some traffic, but it is not bad. I know most people in the neighborhood because not many new people move in. We have a house at the front of our street. We see all the people who come and go. We notice new cars. Some neighbors walk for exercise or with their dogs. Children ride their bikes. We work from home. There are four of us - my wife and two daughters, ages eleven and fourteen. We like to play outside, even in the rain. We also like to grill on our back deck. We hear lawn mowers often from March to October. Our neighborhood has many trees, so it is cool in the summer and colorful in the fall. We rake and burn leaves every year. I like the smell of burning leaves. We don't have much winter, so it feels like fall is very long. We open our garage door to work on our truck or projects. I like working in the garage because I feel connected to the neighborhood. Holidays are quiet here. Some families visit from out of town on holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas. I like living here. If the street were not a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is in the desert. It is very dry. There is no grass in most places. When I look around, I see only dirt. It is hard to understand how people live here unless you have tried it. Many people who live here have nice lawns. They must spend a lot of money to take care of them. When I first lived here, the houses were far apart. Now there are more houses. The neighborhood looks more like a city. But this is true for many places. Most people in my neighborhood are friendly. I like living here. There are some stores in this area. They are chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart and Final. If you want a health food store, you must go to another place. Many people in my town work in construction. This is because there is a lot of empty space for building. I work in construction too. I install drywall and T-bars. This is my full-time job. What I like about my home is the animals. People come to the desert for its beauty. The desert has many animals. We must be careful around them. My family and I like the animals. We have three children. They like lizards and desert bugs. They are outside now, trying to catch them. There are some things to see in my town. You can visit the San Bernardino County Fair. It is a fun event. You can also visit Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains. If you want to learn about the history of the desert, you can go to the Victor Valley Museum. It has many interesting things to see.",
            "My neighborhood is special. It is not like other neighborhoods. I live in a college campus. My community is the people who live in my dormitory. The campus is also my neighborhood.\n\nMy campus has housing. There are three kinds of houses. They are apartments, houses, and dorm rooms. There are many people in the apartments. Each apartment has 2-4 people. There are 4-6 rooms on each floor. The apartments are 2 stories high. About 20 people live in each building.\n\nSome houses are for rent. These houses have 2-4 bedrooms. They are usually lived in by alumni. There are not very many of these houses. They are not very efficient.\n\nDorm rooms are most common. Many students live in these rooms. Each room is shared by 2 people. Some rooms are shared by 3 people.\n\nMy campus is diverse. People from different cultures and ages live here. Some staff live in the houses. New students live in dorms. Older students live in apartments.\n\nThere are many stores on campus. They sell food, clothes, and groceries. You can buy everything you need here. There is one park. It is a playground for all the people on campus. The park is clean and safe.",
            "I have lived in this neighborhood for about 10 years. When I first came here, I was sad. I missed my old neighborhood in Riverdale. But my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to Stockbridge. Our new neighborhood was better than the old one.\n\nOver time, I got used to it and made new friends. I also made some enemies at school. I never really knew my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his children. They are nice people. I consider them like family. We had a good time at Mr. Glen's wedding. I caught a small strap that his wife took off her leg. I wish I had caught the flowers!\n\nOur neighborhood is like a maze. But now I have a GPS, so I can explore it. I like to walk in the park and enjoy nature. It makes me feel calm. I also like to practice my balance with sticks and my wooden sword. There's a basketball and tennis court in the neighborhood. My dad taught me and my best friend to play tennis. We had a lot of fun.\n\nI have many good memories in this neighborhood. I'm looking forward to more good times in the future.",
            "I live near the college I attend, and it's good for me. The neighborhood is nice. There are many apartment buildings, some small restaurants and bars. They are not expensive to visit. One of the bars changed its name. It's now more expensive, but the service is good.\n\nMost people in the neighborhood are students or lower income. They rent apartments because they are not very expensive. There is a school nearby. Many children live here. I do not know my neighbors well. They smoke a lot. The building management put a special machine to make the air smell good near their door. It's funny.\n\nThe buildings around me are old, but they have new insides. A bit down the street, there are new apartments. But I do not like them. They are not well built, but the rent is high. The city gave money to fix the road near my house. Now it's nice. There are big sidewalks, grass and trees. My apartment building is near a lot of trees. The street behind my building has many trees too. But another street, 43rd, is not as nice. The sidewalks are bad, and the buildings look old.\n\nThere are trees on that street to hide the old buildings. Many crimes happen in this area. But I like where I live. It's affordable, and there are many good things nearby. The university is near, and there are two bus stops. I can go to the store or downtown easily.",
            "My neighborhood is a group of houses. They are called duplexes. Each house is on a small street that looks like a circle. They are not in a row. They look like separate houses. They are all painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Most people are friends with each other. We stand at the end of the street some evenings. We talk and watch the children play. They play with toys, draw with chalk, or fly kites. It is nice in this world with many machines. It is like being in a different time. We are near fields and trees. The sky is blue and the clouds are white and big. \n\nBut sometimes there are warnings about a big storm. This year, we had a warning about a tornado. Last night, we heard sirens. We went to a safe place. I was in my bathtub with my little dog. I had my purse and some pillows. My big dog was in the living room. He was nervous and barking. The neighborhood was quiet. We heard the sound of hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road was hot. It was 92 degrees outside and then it dropped to 75. The hail melted when it hit the hot road. The sun came out. It started to rain. I saw a beautiful rainbow. I took a picture with my camera. I wanted to share it with my friends on Facebook. They were amazed, like me. The neighborhood was quiet for a while. Then people started coming home. They had been somewhere else when the storm happened. After that, it was like usual. Mothers and children were outside. Dinner was cooking. Our neighborhood is friendly. I like it here. I just moved here from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I like the way people talk in the South. I have a two-bedroom apartment, like everyone else. But not all apartments are the same inside. Some are very small. It is strange. I like to walk in a big field behind my house. I go to a pond that is not for swimming. I see deer and hear a big bullfrog singing in the morning. It is a great place to live. We are not far from the city of Charlotte. Each morning, we hear roosters crowing from the nearby farms. It is like living in a small village. We have a donkey at a nearby farm. He brays in the evening to say hello. I am lucky to live here.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first. But I became friends with two people who lived near me. One lived two houses down and the other on my street. They are not there anymore, but I still remember them. Most of the people who lived here when I first moved here are still here. My neighborhood is like many other suburban neighborhoods. There are many two-story houses. I hear kids playing outside on nice days. My neighborhood is quiet most days. I have never had a problem with anyone in the neighborhood. You are left alone unless you need help. I order things online and they are always safe on my porch. I trust my neighbors. There is a park near my house. I have many happy memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with other kids. I also got hurt playing football, but the good memories are stronger. Now I go to the park with my younger cousin's kids. They like to play on swings and slides. The park makes me happy. The neighborhood is different from others. We have many kinds of food nearby. You can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants within a short walk. People like to use apps for food. There are also fast food shops like McDonald's. We have many stores with everything you need. There are dry cleaners, a pharmacy, and a grocery store. Some stores are special, like one that sells Indian food. I like my neighborhood. I am thankful for it. Some people on social media have bad experiences with their neighbors. I am lucky.",
            "My neighborhood is a small town in South Carolina. It is not special, but it helps farming. Johnston is known for peaches. The town says it is the Peach Capital of the World. Most of the town is farmland with peach trees or cattle. Houses are far apart. Some are two stories high. They have metal or gray roofs to keep cool. Many houses are not near the road. They are back from the road so people can use the land for animals or crops.\n\nThere is a main part of town with a stop light. This is where the stores are. There are a few places to get food. You can go to Hong Kong for Chinese food, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's for burgers. There used to be a pizza place, but it closed.\n\nThere is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They sell Cherry Coca-Cola. The only grocery store is called IGA. People often go to Walmart in another town to buy groceries. The most popular store is Dollar General. It is busy all the time. There is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture. They deliver furniture. There is a pet store called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They take care of dogs and cats.\n\nThe doctor and vet are in small buildings away from the main part of town. There is one school in the town, Johnston Elementary. Students go to middle and high school in another town after fifth grade. The town is making a new park. It will be 2.5 acres. There is nothing to do in the town. There are no movies, bowling, or places to walk dogs. But people like the town. It is small.",
            "I first heard about my area on a podcast about people who went missing. It was surprising to me. Almost all apartments in the area cost over $1,000 per month. I had never heard of this story before and neither had my friends. I think this is the struggle. Some of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night because things are expensive. But we have learned to be careful with money. We like the smell of old toys and old clothes. When you are older, you smell less. You might start smoking or just get used to things being this way. But the flea market is always there. The smell of old magazines on a piano is strong. It stays even after you wash the piano. There are three thrift stores near me that I can walk to. If I start at the far store, I can visit two charity stores, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is busy with cars and people. But inside the thrift stores, it is quiet. Many people pass by, but you do not hear them inside the stores. It is a nice place to spend an afternoon. Each year, there are more people and cars in the city. It is growing. They say it is like New York. Everyone is busy with their own things. People do not ask many questions. You can be alone and people will leave you alone. This is different from the South, where showing concern means you care. Here, you can keep to yourself if you want. The city will move on like waves on the beach. It is a lively place. I hear music from next door and singing from upstairs. It is nice. We have a community here. We help each other when we need it. We have birthdays, funerals, and help each other out. I am lucky to live here. I like most of my neighbors and they are kind to me. I try to clean up after myself and leave food for them. They do the same. We bring mail to each other. It is nice to see them and I think they like my presence too. I live in a big, modern city. But my neighbors make me feel like I am not totally alone.",
            "I live in a typical suburban area. My neighborhood is like many others. There is a group that makes sure everything looks nice, called a homeowner's association. They take care of the homes. The yards are all similar. They have a small grass area, pretty rocks, and short driveways. Some houses have two cars. The roads are good. There are no holes in the street. Most houses are one story. Some are two stories. We don't have individual mailboxes at each house. We have a group of mailboxes at the end of the street. We use a key to get our mail. There are also two big boxes for packages.\n\nMy house is on the edge of the city. It is a mix of country and suburbs. We have a lot of space. There is a big pool and a walking path. We can walk our dogs or go for a walk. It is safe and nice here. Most people who live here are old. They take care of each other. Some younger people also live here. The city is big, but it feels small. We have many things we need. We have a big store with many things. It's not too big. It's just right. If we drive for 15 minutes, we can go anywhere. There are many stores. We have good food stores and cheap stores. My neighborhood is safe and nice. We have good things like pools and walking paths. We can easily get to any store we want.",
            "I live in a small town in the middle of the United States. Our town is near a big city, but not too close. My neighborhood is on the east side of town. It is not rich, but it is not bad either. The houses are not very valuable, and most people rent or own them. However, it is not ugly or unpleasant. My neighbors are kind people who say hello when I walk by.\n\nThere are sometimes problems in our town. There is more crime here than in other parts of town. There have been a few violent crimes near my house in the past ten years. One time, our neighbors lost their son in a shooting near a bar. But we have not been directly affected by crime. Sometimes, things go missing from our porch if we leave them outside.\n\nOur town has a big problem with a disease called addiction. Many people have died from overdoses. But we have help for people who need it. There are special places to get treatment and trainings to help families and friends.\n\nDespite the problems, our town has many good things. My son's school is very good. The teachers and staff are kind and help him. My son is special, but nobody bothers him at school. The school is a happy place. They have many events to help families and students. They also give free food to all students so they do not go hungry.\n\nOur town is improving, but not all parts are the same. The center of town and the west side are nicer. They have new roads and parks. But the east side, where I live, needs help. I like living here because people are friendly, the schools are good, and we have many stores to buy things. Our home is not worth a lot, but it is comfortable.\n\nWe have lived here for 16 years, and we do not want to leave.",
            "My neighborhood is special. It's on a hill. There are old buildings around me. I live in a 7-story apartment building near an old theater. A block away is a fun arcade bar. Many different kinds of people go there on warm summer nights. There is a long line to get in sometimes. A big park is nearby. It's large for our area. The park is surrounded by concrete. It has big stairs. In winter, homeless people set up tents on the sidewalk and stairs. This keeps them warm. They are close to a place where they can take a bath and wash clothes.\n\nI love my neighborhood. It's not the old buildings that make it special. It's the people. Our neighborhood was once very bad. There were many gangs. The government tried to clean it up. People remember this. They still tell stories. The people here work hard to keep the neighborhood clean. They care about their city and block.\n\nSome people say it's not safe to walk around here at night if you are white. I think this is not true. I'm a little dark. People here see me as one of them. They are kind to me. They gave me a jacket when I needed it. They let me charge my phone when it was raining. They told me I'm beautiful. This is my home. I feel happy walking here at night. I meet nice people who don't try to hurt me.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan. It is a rural area. Farmland and small cities are near each other here. There are no big shopping centers or well-known stores. If you need something, you have to drive to get it.\n\nDespite this, my town is very beautiful. It is next to two large lakes. Beautiful Lake Michigan is on one side and a smaller lake called Lake Charlevoix is on the other. Every place you go, you can find a beach where you can put your feet in the water.\n\nMy neighborhood is a small town neighborhood. Houses are not close together. They are not the same. Some houses are old and some are new. Most houses have basements. You can see them from the street. Many houses have old aluminum siding. The houses in my neighborhood are different colors. Most houses have yards. There are trampolines, playsets, and gardens in the yards. Some people have fences for their animals.\n\nMy neighborhood is like the kind of place people want to live. Many people work hard to make a living. Some are raising families. You can see kids playing outside every day. You can also see people walking dogs, riding bikes, or rollerblading. Neighbors know each other. If someone is new, you can tell. People are friendly. They wave to each other. The lawns are well taken care of. People keep the grass cut and leaves are not on the ground. Plants and bushes are trimmed.\n\nIt is not a very beautiful neighborhood that you drive by and think \"wow.\" It is a safe and quiet place. It is a good place to raise a family. You can walk to the county sheriff's department and the health department. There is a recycling center near by. People use these services. We have baseball and softball fields where you can hear the announcers. Our small town airport is near the fields. You can hear the sound of small planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream or go downtown from my neighborhood. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, which is just a few blocks away. It is a great place to live."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "My city is very big. It has many different kinds of people. Residential areas and commercial areas are mixed together. There are many businesses, like offices and stores, and restaurants. You can find many places to eat and shop. Some stores are big and well-known. Others are small and new. They are called boutiques. Some boutiques are in malls. Others are on the street.\n\nMy neighborhood is very diverse. There are people from different countries and cultures. We have a place for the LGBTQ+ community. We also have a Jewish community and a community of people from the Soviet Union. Nearby, there are many neighborhoods for people from other countries. We have Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia.\n\nBut the city is so big that it takes a long time to get from one place to another. It can take two hours to go 10 miles. Many people do not walk. They drive. The city has a lot of traffic. It is hard to find a parking spot. There are many new buildings being built. But some people do not want more people to move in.\n\nThere are many kinds of houses in my neighborhood. Not everyone lives in a big apartment building. Some people live in single-family homes or duplexes. The neighborhood has people of all ages. I do not know most of my neighbors. We are not a very close community. But I have good memories of playing outside with my friends when I was a child.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most houses are for one family. But some houses are split into two, but still connected. My house has a small front yard and a driveway on the left side. It looks like many other houses here. They remind us of a time when living in the suburbs was a good life. Many people thought this was the American dream. But now it is not as good as it was. My neighborhood is still the same, but some things are not. The people are not as happy. The yards are not as nice. But there are still cars in every driveway. Children still play outside. The public school has been here for almost 90 years. It still makes young people think about the future. It makes older people feel happy and sad at the same time. There are not many churches, and some are empty. But the basketball courts are always full. All the houses look different, but feel the same. There is a big store called Super A. It is owned by a big Yemni family. They are probably the only Arab family in the neighborhood. Most people in the neighborhood are African American. The streets are wide. Children play football. They only stop to let cars go by. Many people have lived here for many years. They can tell stories of a time when everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school. But when the kids stopped watching karate movies, the school became a pharmacy. There is a small movie theater. It shows old movies at a low price. The young people do not like it because it does not have new movies. But older people like it. They think it is a good way to spend an evening. There is a big road that goes through my town. But the entrance and exit are in the town next to ours. Some people wanted to put an exit in our town. The young people wanted it. But the older people did not. They thought it would ruin the town. So the city said no. We are building a new school. We are trying to choose a symbol for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a cabin would be a good symbol.",
            "You might not notice it at first. It is behind a shopping strip. But if you go behind the old Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels, you will find a community. There are apartments on these streets. They are like small buildings. They are next to each other.\n\nSome of these apartments are not good places. We will not talk about them. But the others are different. They are near a school that teaches adults. The school is quiet and sleepy. Students go inside with coffee and start their day.\n\nThe gate of the school creaks open. Commuters are unhappy because it slows down traffic. There is a park across the street. People walk their dogs there. Children play in the park. They run and jump. Old people walk their dogs and look at the teenagers on skateboards.\n\nThere is a store that sells sushi. It is in a shopping area. There is a store for pools and a store for nails. You can get a manicure while buying a pool. There is a store for frozen yogurt. Teenagers eat frozen yogurt and ride their skateboards.\n\nThis is a nice place. It is a small part of America. Not much changes here.",
            "\"This is everywhere,\" she said while we drove past the corn fields. \"This is it!\" I said. She was surprised by the open space. She came from a town where the grocery store was close to her house. She had never seen so much open space before. I knew she would be surprised. I grew up in a rural area of Ohio. I wanted to tell her about it. In that moment, she understood who I was and where I came from.\n\nWe drove down a country road. There was a quarry on the left. It was full of water. Behind the quarry was the place where I live. The houses are made of brick and stucco. They have a lot of space. We take care of the land around our houses. In the spring, there are flowers and trees. The driveways have nice cars. My neighbor was outside. He was mowing his lawn. He was singing. He is a friendly man.\n\nMy neighbor used to be a doctor. He is older now. He is not as quick as he used to be. He has a special history. He takes care of his lawn. He uses a big mower. Everyone likes him.\n\nWe will soon reach my house. There are geese in the yard. They are chased by our dog. There is a stream behind the house. It goes into the quarry. You can hear frogs and the stream. You can also hear animals from the nearby farms.\n\nThere is a special place behind the house. It is an oasis. There are trees and wildflowers. I spent a lot of time here as a child. I built forts and chased animals. I had friends in the neighborhood. The winters can be very cold. But they are also beautiful. The trees are bare. It looks empty. Sometimes it snows. Then it looks like a winter wonderland. My sister made snow angels in the yard. We built snowmen. We used snowballs to fight. We built forts to keep our things safe. We played in our own little world. We were happy and did not worry about anything.\"",
            "Portland, Oregon is a city that values being different. The city's slogan is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" For some, this means remembering the past when Portland was smaller and less expensive. In those days, the city had its own unique culture. Today, people come to Portland to be different and be accepted as different. However, this also means the city has grown more expensive and crowded. Many new buildings have been built to house people from California.\n\nPortland is different. It means the city accepts things that are not normal. But it also has modern things like other cities. We buy many things from China like other parts of the country. Portland has yoga, hipsters, and business people. It is just that we do not take things too seriously.\n\nIn my neighborhood, people have colorful houses and gardens. In the summer, you can find free things on the sidewalk. These are boxes with items people no longer want. You can find clothes, books, or other things. Sometimes you can find something special. This is what Portland is like to me. But everyone is different. Some people like to do yoga with goats or watch soccer games. Other people like to try new things.\n\nPortland has problems. Some people have drug problems. These problems often come from mental health issues. The rain and gray skies may also be a problem. Portland also has people who do not have homes. The city offers services to help them, but it is not enough. People who do not have homes and people who do have homes do not always agree on what to do.",

They help me when I am feeling anxious. I first saw the mountains when I came to this town for school. The university is nice with its buildings and ponds and trees. But the mountains are special to me. I like to visit them when I need to think. The town is also nice. There are many cafes where I study. The downtown area is old and beautiful. It has old buildings with colorful bricks. This part of town is busy like a big city. But if I walk a little further, I can find a quiet place. The library is near the quiet place. The town has two different feelings. One part is busy and one part is quiet. This is what makes this town special. I have many good memories here. I like walking in the park with friends. I like going to the movies in the theater. But I also have bad memories. Sometimes I go to the pond to think and feel sad. The pond is a good place to think and cry. While I watch the animals at the pond, I think about my life and my place in it. I wonder what I am supposed to do with my life. I walk to the main street and see the sun shining. I look at the mountains and feel strong. The mountains remind me to keep going.",

Bensonhurst is a city neighborhood, so you will feel like you are in New York. You will see many Asian stores. Many Asian people live in Bensonhurst, and this is why you will see many Asian stores. They sell food, laundry service, and other things.

People call it the \"exercise hill\" because many people like to run up it. There are no sidewalks on my street, so people walk on the road. The road has some holes and can be difficult to drive on. Telephone and electric wires are hung around the neighborhood. They look old. Sometimes strong wind and rain break the wires. This makes the wires look broken. There are many tall trees everywhere. But people do not like the trees. They want to cut them down because they block the view of the ocean. Many houses are built high on the hill. They have big windows to see the ocean. It is nice to see the ocean at sunset. The water looks nice and the sky turns orange. But it is often cloudy and rainy here. The sunlight is blocked by the cloud. The sun does not shine every day. It is often overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything. It even grows on my car. I left my car outside for a month and it became green and hairy with moss. It took me three hours to clean it. There are not many children in my neighborhood. There is a school near my home. But most people in my neighborhood are old and retired. They have dogs instead of children. Dogs run in the street and sometimes enter homes through open doors and windows. It is common to see dogs in lawns and streets. Rabbits are also in the area. They dig up gardens and lawns. My cats like to hunt the rabbits and have chased most of them out of our neighborhood. We also see many birds, including small birds and big birds of prey. They fly over the area until the neighborhood crows chase them away. There are no stores near my home. But if I walk down the hill to the waterfront, I can find some restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There is no big beach, but it is fun to throw rocks into the water. The bay is not very wide. I can see the other side of the bay even on cloudy days.",

It means fall has arrived. \n\nOur garage is at the back of our house. We use the front door only when someone knocks. I like to work in the garage.

Apartments have 2-4 people in each room. There are 4-6 rooms on each floor. One building usually has 2 floors and about 20 people live there. Some houses have 2-4 bedrooms and are rented by school alumni. There are not many of these houses. Most people live in dormitories. A dormitory is a building with many rooms.

But the city fixed the road near my apartment. Now it is nicer. My apartment building has many trees. The city cut some down, but I like the trees. Behind my building are more trees and another apartment complex. The street behind my building is not very nice. The sidewalks are bad and the buildings look old. Many trees hide the buildings' bad looks. There is crime on this street. One apartment complex has a lot of problems. But I like where I live. It is close to the university and I can walk there.

They are all painted yellow with white porches and green roofs. Most people like each other, but not everyone. We stand at the end of a street some evenings and talk while the small children play outside. It is a nice change from our busy world. It is like going back in time. We are near fields and trees with blue skies and white clouds. \n\nThere is one problem. This season, we have had tornado warnings. One night we heard the warning sirens, and we went to a safe place. My little dog and I went into the bathtub, and my big dog stayed in the living room. The storm was loud, and we could hear big hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the street was hot from the change in temperature. The hail melted when it hit the hot pavement. The sky started to clear, and the sun came out. I saw a beautiful rainbow. I took pictures to share with my friends on Facebook. They were happy, like I was. The people in the neighborhood were quiet for a while after the storm. Then they went back to their normal activities, like cooking dinner. I like this neighborhood because it is friendly. I moved here from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I like the way people talk in the South. I have a two-bedroom apartment like most people. But the apartments are different inside. Some are small. I like to walk in the big field behind my house and visit the small pond. I see deer and hear a big frog singing in the morning. This is a great place to live, just 40 minutes from Charlotte. I like hearing the roosters crowing in the morning. It is like living in a small village. We even have a donkey that brays in the evening. I am lucky to live here.",

I ordered packages online and they were always safe. I trust my neighbors.\n\nThere is a park near my house. I have many happy memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with my friends. I also got hurt playing football, but the good memories are more important. Now, I go to the park with my cousin's kids. They like playing on swings and slides. The park makes me happy. The neighborhood is different from others. You can find many kinds of food here. There are Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants near here. But many people now use apps to get food delivered. There is a grocery store, Walgreens, CVS, and dry cleaners near here. There is also an Indian store where you can buy Indian food. I like my neighborhood. I see bad things on social media and news about some people's neighbors. I am happy with mine.",
            "My neighborhood is a small town. It is in South Carolina. Johnston is a special place. It is called the Peach Capital of the World. This is what the town says on its welcome sign. Most of Johnston is farmland with peach trees or cattle. Some houses are far apart from the main part of town. They are usually two stories high with metal or gray roofs to keep cool. Most houses are not near the road. They are behind the houses, used for animals and crops.\n\nIn the main part of town, there is a stop light at a four-way intersection. This is where you can find the town's stores. There are three places to get fast food. One is a small Chinese restaurant called Hong Kong. Another is a Mexican restaurant called Fiesta. The third is a small burger place called Gary's. There used to be a pizza place, but it closed.\n\nThere is a small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They are famous for selling Cherry Coca-Cola. The only grocery store in town is called IGA. People usually don't buy much here. They like to go to a big store in a nearby town called Walmart. The most popular store in Johnston is Dollar General. They sell many common things and it is always busy.\n\nThere is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. It has been in Johnston for a long time. The owner is a kind woman. She also employs people to help move furniture. Next to the furniture store is a pet grooming shop called Clark's Cuts. They take care of pets, including feeding, boarding, and grooming.\n\nThe doctor's office and the veterinarian are not in the main part of town. They are small, but they can help the people of Johnston. There is one elementary school called Johnston Elementary. When students finish fifth grade, they go to school in the next town. Johnston is small. There are no parks, but they are building a new place for families to play.\n\nThere is not much to do in Johnston. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or places for people to hang out. But it is a nice town. You can easily miss it if you blink.",
            "I first heard about my neighborhood on a podcast about people who disappeared. This was surprising to me. Almost every apartment in the area costs more than one thousand dollars a month. I had never heard this story before and neither had my friends. Maybe it's because we are struggling. I know some of my friends cry at night because things are expensive. We have learned to be careful with money. We like used things. We like the smell of old toys and clothes that are not used. As people get older, we smell less. We might start to smoke or be used to how things are. But the flea market always reminds us of this. The smell of old magazines on a piano is strong. It stays in the leather even after we wash it. There are three used stores near my home. One is on the far side and has two stores that help charity, a library, a store with old books, and a store with strange things. The streets are very crowded in the city center. Cars and people are everywhere in the morning. But we can't hear the noise in the used stores. Many people and cars go by, but the stores are quiet. It's a nice place to spend an afternoon. More and more people come here every year. The city is growing. It's a big city with one of the biggest internet companies. It's still not perfect. It reminds me of New York. People are focused on their goals and don't ask many questions. We can be alone if we want and people will leave us alone. It's different from the South, where people ask if you care. We can keep to ourselves here and the city will move around us like the ocean waves. This is a lively place to live. There is music near my home. A person plays the piano next door and two people sing upstairs. We come together for important things, like birthdays and help each other when we can. I'm lucky to live here. I like most of my neighbors and they are kind to me. We help each other and leave food for each other. We take care of each other's mail. It's nice to see them and I think they like me too. I live in a big, modern city, but my neighbors make me feel like I'm not alone.",
            "I live in a common type of neighborhood. Many people in my area have well-maintained homes. The homes are all very similar. They have green grass, small stones, and short driveways. Some have small trees. Every house has two cars. The streets are in good condition. There are no holes in the road. Most homes are one story, but some are two stories.\n\nThere are shared mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to get their mail. There are also two big boxes for packages. The neighborhood is near the edge of the city, so it feels like the country and the suburbs. We have a lot of space. There are swimming pools that everyone can use. They are safe and well-maintained. We also have paths where people can walk their dogs or go for a walk.\n\nMost people living here are older. It is a safe place. People look out for each other. We also have some middle-aged and young people. The city is big, but it feels small. We have many things that people need. We have a small mall with many stores. It takes me 15 minutes to drive to the mall. There are many stores with different kinds of food and other things. We have places to buy expensive food and cheap food. My neighborhood is safe, clean, and good. We have nice things like pools and paths. It is easy to get to other places by car.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest. It is near a big city. My neighborhood is on the east side of town. It is an area with lower incomes. People who own homes in this area mostly rent or buy them. The houses are not expensive. However, the neighborhood is not unattractive. People are friendly. They say hello when I walk by. There is a little more crime here than in other areas of town. There have been a few bad incidents near my home. My next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting last year. However, my family has not been hurt by crime. Sometimes we lose small things from our porch if we forget to bring them inside. Our town is affected by a big problem called the opioid epidemic. Many people have died from overdoses. There are many places to help people who are struggling with addiction. The town has good schools. My son's school is excellent. The staff is kind and helpful. My son has a special need, but he is not bullied. The school has a good atmosphere. The teachers and staff do their best to help all students. The school provides food for all students so they do not go hungry. No family is treated unfairly because they cannot pay. The town government has made some changes to improve our town. They have fixed roads, planted trees, and improved the parks. Unfortunately, most of these changes happened in the center of town and on the west side. I like living in this town. People are friendly, the schools are great, and there are many stores to buy things we need. Our home is not worth much, but it is comfortable. We have lived here for over 16 years. We do not want to live anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is very interesting. It's on a hill and has many old buildings. I live in a big apartment building. It's across from a old theater and near a park. People like to go to a cool bar in the park area at night. The park is big for our area. It has a wall with stairs. During the cold months, homeless people set up their tents in rows on the sidewalk and stairs. They do this to stay warm. The rain in our area is heavier than the snow, so it's hard to stay warm. They stay together for warmth and can easily walk to a place where they can wash themselves.\n\nI like my neighborhood. It's not just the old buildings and hills that I like. I like the people. Our neighborhood used to be very bad. There was a lot of violence. The government and police had to come in to clean it up. The people remember this. They still tell stories about it. They work hard to keep their neighborhood clean. They care about what happens in their neighborhood. Some people say white people should not walk around at night. I think this is because of the past. I am not white, but I can pass for white. I think the people in my neighborhood see me as one of them. They are kind to me. They are not mean. People in my neighborhood help each other. A store owner stayed open late so I could charge my phone. Someone gave me money and told me I'm beautiful.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan. It is a quiet place. I like it because it is close to water. I live near two big lakes, Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. You can swim in these lakes.\n\nMy town is not a big city. I do not see big stores like Walmart or Target. We have to drive to get to any store. My neighborhood is special. Houses are not the same. They are old and new, some have been updated. There are many colors of houses. Most houses have yards with trampolines and playsets for kids. Some people have gardens and fences for their animals.\n\nHardworking people live here. They work to make a living and raise families. You can see kids playing outside and people walking dogs or riding bikes. Neighbors know each other and say hello. The lawns are kept clean. The grass is mowed and looks nice.\n\nIt is a safe place to live. The county sheriff's office and jail are near my house. We have a recycling center where people bring their trash. There are baseball fields where you can hear the announcers calling the game. Small planes fly overhead. I can walk to the ice cream shop and to the park. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, which is just a few blocks away. It is a great place to live."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "My city is very big. It has many different kinds of people. Residential areas and commercial areas are mixed together. There are many businesses, like offices and stores, and restaurants. You can find many places to eat and shop. Some stores are big and well-known. Others are small and new. They are called boutiques. Some boutiques are in malls. Others are on the street.\n\nMy neighborhood is very diverse. There are people from different countries and cultures. We have a place for the LGBTQ+ community. We also have a Jewish community and a community of people from the Soviet Union. Nearby, there are many neighborhoods for people from other countries. We have Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia.\n\nBut the city is so big that it takes a long time to get from one place to another. It can take two hours to go 10 miles. Many people do not walk. They drive. The city has a lot of traffic. It is hard to find a parking spot. There are many new buildings being built. But some people do not want more people to move in.\n\nThere are many kinds of houses in my neighborhood. Not everyone lives in a big apartment building. Some people live in single-family homes or duplexes. The neighborhood has people of all ages. I do not know most of my neighbors. We are not a very close community. But I have good memories of playing outside with my friends when I was a child.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most houses are for one family. But some houses are split into two, but still connected. My house has a small front yard and a driveway on the left side. It looks like many other houses here. They remind us of a time when living in the suburbs was a good life. Many people thought this was the American dream. But now it is not as good as it was. My neighborhood is still the same, but some things are not. The people are not as happy. The yards are not as nice. But there are still cars in every driveway. Children still play outside. The public school has been here for almost 90 years. It still makes young people think about the future. It makes older people feel happy and sad at the same time. There are not many churches, and some are empty. But the basketball courts are always full. All the houses look different, but feel the same. There is a big store called Super A. It is owned by a big Yemni family. They are probably the only Arab family in the neighborhood. Most people in the neighborhood are African American. The streets are wide. Children play football. They only stop to let cars go by. Many people have lived here for many years. They can tell stories of a time when everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school. But when the kids stopped watching karate movies, the school became a pharmacy. There is a small movie theater. It shows old movies at a low price. The young people do not like it because it does not have new movies. But older people like it. They think it is a good way to spend an evening. There is a big road that goes through my town. But the entrance and exit are in the town next to ours. Some people wanted to put an exit in our town. The young people wanted it. But the older people did not. They thought it would ruin the town. So the city said no. We are building a new school. We are trying to choose a symbol for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a cabin would be a good symbol.",
            "You might not notice it at first. It is behind a shopping strip. But if you go behind the old Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels, you will find a community. There are apartments on these streets. They are like small buildings. They are next to each other.\n\nSome of these apartments are not good places. We will not talk about them. But the others are different. They are near a school that teaches adults. The school is quiet and sleepy. Students go inside with coffee and start their day.\n\nThe gate of the school creaks open. Commuters are unhappy because it slows down traffic. There is a park across the street. People walk their dogs there. Children play in the park. They run and jump. Old people walk their dogs and look at the teenagers on skateboards.\n\nThere is a store that sells sushi. It is in a shopping area. There is a store for pools and a store for nails. You can get a manicure while buying a pool. There is a store for frozen yogurt. Teenagers eat frozen yogurt and ride their skateboards.\n\nThis is a nice place. It is a small part of America. Not much changes here.",
            "\"This is everywhere,\" she said while we drove past the corn fields. \"This is it!\" I said. She was surprised by the open space. She came from a town where the grocery store was close to her house. She had never seen so much open space before. I knew she would be surprised. I grew up in a rural area of Ohio. I wanted to tell her about it. In that moment, she understood who I was and where I came from.\n\nWe drove down a country road. There was a quarry on the left. It was full of water. Behind the quarry was the place where I live. The houses are made of brick and stucco. They have a lot of space. We take care of the land around our houses. In the spring, there are flowers and trees. The driveways have nice cars. My neighbor was outside. He was mowing his lawn. He was singing. He is a friendly man.\n\nMy neighbor used to be a doctor. He is older now. He is not as quick as he used to be. He has a special history. He takes care of his lawn. He uses a big mower. Everyone likes him.\n\nWe will soon reach my house. There are geese in the yard. They are chased by our dog. There is a stream behind the house. It goes into the quarry. You can hear frogs and the stream. You can also hear animals from the nearby farms.\n\nThere is a special place behind the house. It is an oasis. There are trees and wildflowers. I spent a lot of time here as a child. I built forts and chased animals. I had friends in the neighborhood. The winters can be very cold. But they are also beautiful. The trees are bare. It looks empty. Sometimes it snows. Then it looks like a winter wonderland. My sister made snow angels in the yard. We built snowmen. We used snowballs to fight. We built forts to keep our things safe. We played in our own little world. We were happy and did not worry about anything.\"",
            "Portland, Oregon is a city that values being different. The city's slogan is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" For some, this means remembering the past when Portland was smaller and less expensive. In those days, the city had its own unique culture. Today, people come to Portland to be different and be accepted as different. However, this also means the city has grown more expensive and crowded. Many new buildings have been built to house people from California.\n\nPortland is different. It means the city accepts things that are not normal. But it also has modern things like other cities. We buy many things from China like other parts of the country. Portland has yoga, hipsters, and business people. It is just that we do not take things too seriously.\n\nIn my neighborhood, people have colorful houses and gardens. In the summer, you can find free things on the sidewalk. These are boxes with items people no longer want. You can find clothes, books, or other things. Sometimes you can find something special. This is what Portland is like to me. But everyone is different. Some people like to do yoga with goats or watch soccer games. Other people like to try new things.\n\nPortland has problems. Some people have drug problems. These problems often come from mental health issues. The rain and gray skies may also be a problem. Portland also has people who do not have homes.

But the mountains are special to me. I like to visit them when I need to think. The town is also nice. There are many cafes where I study. The downtown area is old and beautiful. It has old buildings with colorful bricks. This part of town is busy like a big city. But if I walk a little further, I can find a quiet place. The library is near the quiet place. The town has two different feelings. One part is busy and one part is quiet. This is what makes this town special. I have many good memories here. I like walking in the park with friends. I like going to the movies in the theater. But I also have bad memories. Sometimes I go to the pond to think and feel sad. The pond is a good place to think and cry. While I watch the animals at the pond, I think about my life and my place in it. I wonder what I am supposed to do with my life. I walk to the main street and see the sun shining. I look at the mountains and feel strong. The mountains remind me to keep going.",

People call it the \"exercise hill\" because many people like to run up it. There are no sidewalks on my street, so people walk on the road. The road has some holes and can be difficult to drive on. Telephone and electric wires are hung around the neighborhood. They look old. Sometimes strong wind and rain break the wires. This makes the wires look broken. There are many tall trees everywhere. But people do not like the trees. They want to cut them down because they block the view of the ocean. Many houses are built high on the hill. They have big windows to see the ocean. It is nice to see the ocean at sunset. The water looks nice and the sky turns orange. But it is often cloudy and rainy here. The sunlight is blocked by the cloud. The sun does not shine every day. It is often overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything. It even grows on my car. I left my car outside for a month and it became green and hairy with moss. It took me three hours to clean it. There are not many children in my neighborhood. There is a school near my home. But most people in my neighborhood are old and retired. They have dogs instead of children. Dogs run in the street and sometimes enter homes through open doors and windows. It is common to see dogs in lawns and streets. Rabbits are also in the area. They dig up gardens and lawns. My cats like to hunt the rabbits and have chased most of them out of our neighborhood. We also see many birds, including small birds and big birds of prey. They fly over the area until the neighborhood crows chase them away. There are no stores near my home. But if I walk down the hill to the waterfront, I can find some restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There is no big beach, but it is fun to throw rocks into the water. The bay is not very wide. I can see the other side of the bay even on cloudy days.",

It means fall has arrived. \n\nOur garage is at the back of our house. We use the front door only when someone knocks. I like to work in the garage.

My neighbors were kind to me, especially Mr. Glen and his family. We had fun together, like when we went to his wedding. I caught a special strap Ms. Veda wore on her leg, but I missed catching the flowers! We danced and had a good time.\n\nThe neighborhood is like a big maze. Now I have a GPS, so I can explore it. I like to play video games with my friends Kason and Curtis. We also play games outside, like in the park. The park is nice and calm. It makes me feel peaceful.\n\nI like to bring sticks from the store and practice my balance. I also like to bring my wooden sword and have fun. There is a basketball and tennis court, but I do not play as much as I used to. My dad taught me tennis when I was younger. I had fun playing with him.\n\nI have many good memories in this neighborhood. I hope I will have more in the future.",
            "I live near the college I attend. I like this place. Many apartment buildings are here, some restaurants and bars too. The bars are not very expensive. One bar is new, but it is not very good. Many people are friendly. They are college students or work in lower income jobs. The housing is not very expensive. There is a school near my apartment. Many children live here. I do not know my neighbors. They smoke a lot of marijuana. My building managers put a freshener near their door. It is funny. \n\nThe buildings near me are old but maybe nice inside. A little further down the street are new apartments. I do not like them. They are not well built but cost a lot. The restaurant near me is cheap. They serve food on paper plates and heat it in a microwave. Across from the restaurant is a gas station. It is not a good place to work. But the city fixed the road near my apartment. Now it is nicer. My apartment building has many trees. The city cut some down, but I like the trees. Behind my building are more trees and another apartment complex. The street behind my building is not very nice. The sidewalks are bad and the buildings look old. Many trees hide the buildings' bad looks. There is crime on this street. One apartment complex has a lot of problems. But I like where I live. It is close to the university and I can walk there. There are bus stops nearby too.",
            "My neighborhood is made up of two-house houses on a closed street. The houses are placed far apart and look like separate houses. They are all painted yellow with white porches and green roofs. Most people like each other, but not everyone. We stand at the end of a street some evenings and talk while the small children play outside. It is a nice change from our busy world. It is like going back in time. We are near fields and trees with blue skies and white clouds. \n\nThere is one problem. This season, we have had tornado warnings. One night we heard the warning sirens, and we went to a safe place. My little dog and I went into the bathtub, and my big dog stayed in the living room. The storm was loud, and we could hear big hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the street was hot from the change in temperature. The hail melted when it hit the hot pavement. The sky started to clear, and the sun came out. I saw a beautiful rainbow. I took pictures to share with my friends on Facebook. They were happy, like I was. The people in the neighborhood were quiet for a while after the storm. Then they went back to their normal activities, like cooking dinner. I like this neighborhood because it is friendly. I moved here from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I like the way people talk in the South. I have a two-bedroom apartment like most people. But the apartments are different inside. Some are small. I like to walk in the big field behind my house and visit the small pond. I see deer and hear a big frog singing in the morning. This is a great place to live, just 40 minutes from Charlotte. I like hearing the roosters crowing in the morning. It is like living in a small village. We even have a donkey that brays in the evening. I am lucky to live here.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard to make friends at first. I made friends with two people who lived near me. They no longer live here, but I still think about them. The people who lived here when I first moved here are still living here. My neighborhood is normal. It has many two-story houses. You can hear kids playing outside on weekends. The neighborhood is quiet most days. I have never had problems with my neighbors. I feel safe here. They leave me alone unless I need help. I ordered packages online and they were always safe. I trust my neighbors.\n\nThere is a park near my house. I have many happy memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with my friends. I also got hurt playing football, but the good memories are more important. Now, I go to the park with my cousin's kids. They like playing on swings and slides. The park makes me happy. The neighborhood is different from others. You can find many kinds of food here. There are Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants near here. But many people now use apps to get food delivered. There is a grocery store, Walgreens, CVS, and dry cleaners near here. There is also an Indian store where you can buy Indian food. I like my neighborhood. I see bad things on social media and news about some people's neighbors. I am happy with mine.",
            "My neighborhood is a small town. It is in South Carolina. Johnston is a special place. It is called the Peach Capital of the World. This is what the town says on its welcome sign. Most of Johnston is farmland with peach trees or cattle. Some houses are far apart from the main part of town. They are usually two stories high with metal or gray roofs to keep cool. Most houses are not near the road. They are behind the houses, used for animals and crops.\n\nIn the main part of town, there is a stop light at a four-way intersection. This is where you can find the town's stores. There are three places to get fast food. One is a small Chinese restaurant called Hong Kong. Another is a Mexican restaurant called Fiesta. The third is a small burger place called Gary's. There used to be a pizza place, but it closed.\n\nThere is a small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They are famous for selling Cherry Coca-Cola. The only grocery store in town is called IGA. People usually don't buy much here. They like to go to a big store in a nearby town called Walmart. The most popular store in Johnston is Dollar General. They sell many common things and it is always busy.\n\nThere is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. It has been in Johnston for a long time. The owner is a kind woman. She also employs people to help move furniture. Next to the furniture store is a pet grooming shop called Clark's Cuts. They take care of pets, including feeding, boarding, and grooming.\n\nThe doctor's office and the veterinarian are not in the main part of town. They are small, but they can help the people of Johnston. There is one elementary school called Johnston Elementary. When students finish fifth grade, they go to school in the next town. Johnston is small. There are no parks, but they are building a new place for families to play.\n\nThere is not much to do in Johnston. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or places for people to hang out. But it is a nice town. You can easily miss it if you blink.",
            "I first heard about my neighborhood on a podcast about people who disappeared. This was surprising to me. Almost every apartment in the area costs more than one thousand dollars a month. I had never heard this story before and neither had my friends. Maybe it's because we are struggling. I know some of my friends cry at night because things are expensive. We have learned to be careful with money. We like used things. We like the smell of old toys and clothes that are not used. As people get older, we smell less. We might start to smoke or be used to how things are. But the flea market always reminds us of this. The smell of old magazines on a piano is strong. It stays in the leather even after we wash it. There are three used stores near my home. One is on the far side and has two stores that help charity, a library, a store with old books, and a store with strange things. The streets are very crowded in the city center. Cars and people are everywhere in the morning. But we can't hear the noise in the used stores. Many people and cars go by, but the stores are quiet. It's a nice place to spend an afternoon. More and more people come here every year. The city is growing. It's a big city with one of the biggest internet companies. It's still not perfect. It reminds me of New York. People are focused on their goals and don't ask many questions. We can be alone if we want and people will leave us alone. It's different from the South, where people ask if you care. We can keep to ourselves here and the city will move around us like the ocean waves. This is a lively place to live. There is music near my home. A person plays the piano next door and two people sing upstairs. We come together for important things, like birthdays and help each other when we can. I'm lucky to live here. I like most of my neighbors and they are kind to me. We help each other and leave food for each other. We take care of each other's mail. It's nice to see them and I think they like me too. I live in a big, modern city, but my neighbors make me feel like I'm not alone.",
            "I live in a common type of neighborhood. Many people in my area have well-maintained homes. The homes are all very similar. They have green grass, small stones, and short driveways. Some have small trees. Every house has two cars. The streets are in good condition. There are no holes in the road. Most homes are one story, but some are two stories.\n\nThere are shared mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to get their mail. There are also two big boxes for packages. The neighborhood is near the edge of the city, so it feels like the country and the suburbs. We have a lot of space. There are swimming pools that everyone can use. They are safe and well-maintained. We also have paths where people can walk their dogs or go for a walk.\n\nMost people living here are older. It is a safe place. People look out for each other. We also have some middle-aged and young people. The city is big, but it feels small. We have many things that people need. We have a small mall with many stores. It takes me 15 minutes to drive to the mall. There are many stores with different kinds of food and other things. We have places to buy expensive food and cheap food. My neighborhood is safe, clean, and good. We have nice things like pools and paths. It is easy to get to other places by car.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest. It is near a big city. My neighborhood is on the east side of town. It is an area with lower incomes. People who own homes in this area mostly rent or buy them. The houses are not expensive. However, the neighborhood is not unattractive. People are friendly. They say hello when I walk by. There is a little more crime here than in other areas of town. There have been a few bad incidents near my home. My next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting last year. However, my family has not been hurt by crime. Sometimes we lose small things from our porch if we forget to bring them inside. Our town is affected by a big problem called the opioid epidemic. Many people have died from overdoses. There are many places to help people who are struggling with addiction. The town has good schools. My son's school is excellent. The staff is kind and helpful. My son has a special need, but he is not bullied. The school has a good atmosphere. The teachers and staff do their best to help all students. The school provides food for all students so they do not go hungry. No family is treated unfairly because they cannot pay. The town government has made some changes to improve our town. They have fixed roads, planted trees, and improved the parks. Unfortunately, most of these changes happened in the center of town and on the west side. I like living in this town. People are friendly, the schools are great, and there are many stores to buy things we need. Our home is not worth much, but it is comfortable. We have lived here for over 16 years. We do not want to live anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is very interesting. It's on a hill and has many old buildings. I live in a big apartment building. It's across from a old theater and near a park. People like to go to a cool bar in the park area at night. The park is big for our area. It has a wall with stairs. During the cold months, homeless people set up their tents in rows on the sidewalk and stairs. They do this to stay warm. The rain in our area is heavier than the snow, so it's hard to stay warm. They stay together for warmth and can easily walk to a place where they can wash themselves.\n\nI like my neighborhood. It's not just the old buildings and hills that I like. I like the people. Our neighborhood used to be very bad. There was a lot of violence. The government and police had to come in to clean it up. The people remember this. They still tell stories about it. They work hard to keep their neighborhood clean. They care about what happens in their neighborhood. Some people say white people should not walk around at night. I think this is because of the past. I am not white, but I can pass for white. I think the people in my neighborhood see me as one of them. They are kind to me. They are not mean. People in my neighborhood help each other. A store owner stayed open late so I could charge my phone. Someone gave me money and told me I'm beautiful.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan. It is a quiet place. I like it because it is close to water. I live near two big lakes, Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. You can swim in these lakes.\n\nMy town is not a big city. I do not see big stores like Walmart or Target. We have to drive to get to any store. My neighborhood is special. Houses are not the same. They are old and new, some have been updated. There are many colors of houses. Most houses have yards with trampolines and playsets for kids. Some people have gardens and fences for their animals.\n\nHardworking people live here. They work to make a living and raise families. You can see kids playing outside and people walking dogs or riding bikes. Neighbors know each other and say hello. The lawns are kept clean. The grass is mowed and looks nice.\n\nIt is a safe place to live. The county sheriff's office and jail are near my house. We have a recycling center where people bring their trash. There are baseball fields where you can hear the announcers calling the game. Small planes fly overhead. I can walk to the ice cream shop and to the park. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, which is just a few blocks away. It is a great place to live."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "My city is very big. It has many different kinds of people. Residential areas and commercial areas are mixed together. There are many businesses, like offices and stores, and restaurants. You can find many places to eat and shop. Some stores are big and well-known. Others are small and new. They are called boutiques. Some boutiques are in malls. Others are on the street.\n\nMy neighborhood is very diverse. There are people from different countries and cultures. We have a place for the LGBTQ+ community. We also have a Jewish community and a community of people from the Soviet Union. Nearby, there are many neighborhoods for people from other countries. We have Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia.\n\nBut the city is so big that it takes a long time to get from one place to another. It can take two hours to go 10 miles. Many people do not walk. They drive. The city has a lot of traffic. It is hard to find a parking spot. There are many new buildings being built. But some people do not want more people to move in.\n\nThere are many kinds of houses in my neighborhood. Not everyone lives in a big apartment building. Some people live in single-family homes or duplexes. The neighborhood has people of all ages. I do not know most of my neighbors. We are not a very close community. But I have good memories of playing outside with my friends when I was a child.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most houses are for one family. But some houses are split into two, but still connected. My house has a small front yard and a driveway on the left side. It looks like many other houses here. They remind us of a time when living in the suburbs was a good life. Many people thought this was the American dream. But now it is not as good as it was. My neighborhood is still the same, but some things are not. The people are not as happy. The yards are not as nice. But there are still cars in every driveway. Children still play outside. The public school has been here for almost 90 years. It still makes young people think about the future. It makes older people feel happy and sad at the same time. There are not many churches, and some are empty. But the basketball courts are always full. All the houses look different, but feel the same. There is a big store called Super A. It is owned by a big Yemni family. They are probably the only Arab family in the neighborhood. Most people in the neighborhood are African American. The streets are wide. Children play football. They only stop to let cars go by. Many people have lived here for many years. They can tell stories of a time when everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school. But when the kids stopped watching karate movies, the school became a pharmacy. There is a small movie theater. It shows old movies at a low price. The young people do not like it because it does not have new movies. But older people like it. They think it is a good way to spend an evening. There is a big road that goes through my town. But the entrance and exit are in the town next to ours. Some people wanted to put an exit in our town. The young people wanted it. But the older people did not. They thought it would ruin the town. So the city said no. We are building a new school. We are trying to choose a symbol for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a cabin would be a good symbol.",
            "You might not notice it at first. It is behind a shopping strip. But if you go behind the old Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels, you will find a community. There are apartments on these streets. They are like small buildings. They are next to each other.\n\nSome of these apartments are not good places. We will not talk about them. But the others are different. They are near a school that teaches adults. The school is quiet and sleepy. Students go inside with coffee and start their day.\n\nThe gate of the school creaks open. Commuters are unhappy because it slows down traffic. There is a park across the street. People walk their dogs there. Children play in the park. They run and jump. Old people walk their dogs and look at the teenagers on skateboards.\n\nThere is a store that sells sushi. It is in a shopping area. There is a store for pools and a store for nails. You can get a manicure while buying a pool. There is a store for frozen yogurt. Teenagers eat frozen yogurt and ride their skateboards.\n\nThis is a nice place. It is a small part of America. Not much changes here.",
            "\"This is everywhere,\" she said while we drove past the corn fields. \"This is it!\" I said. She was surprised by the open space. She came from a town where the grocery store was close to her house. She had never seen so much open space before. I knew she would be surprised. I grew up in a rural area of Ohio. I wanted to tell her about it. In that moment, she understood who I was and where I came from.\n\nWe drove down a country road. There was a quarry on the left. It was full of water. Behind the quarry was the place where I live. The houses are made of brick and stucco. They have a lot of space. We take care of the land around our houses. In the spring, there are flowers and trees. The driveways have nice cars. My neighbor was outside. He was mowing his lawn. He was singing. He is a friendly man.\n\nMy neighbor used to be a doctor. He is older now. He is not as quick as he used to be. He has a special history. He takes care of his lawn. He uses a big mower. Everyone likes him.\n\nWe will soon reach my house. There are geese in the yard. They are chased by our dog. There is a stream behind the house. It goes into the quarry. You can hear frogs and the stream. You can also hear animals from the nearby farms.\n\nThere is a special place behind the house. It is an oasis. There are trees and wildflowers. I spent a lot of time here as a child. I built forts and chased animals. I had friends in the neighborhood. The winters can be very cold. But they are also beautiful. The trees are bare. It looks empty. Sometimes it snows. Then it looks like a winter wonderland. My sister made snow angels in the yard. We built snowmen. We used snowballs to fight. We built forts to keep our things safe. We played in our own little world. We were happy and did not worry about anything.\"",
            "Portland, Oregon is a city that values being different. The city's slogan is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" For some, this means remembering the past when Portland was smaller and less expensive. In those days, the city had its own unique culture. Today, people come to Portland to be different and be accepted as different. However, this also means the city has grown more expensive and crowded. Many new buildings have been built to house people from California.\n\nPortland is different. It means the city accepts things that are not normal. But it also has modern things like other cities. We buy many things from China like other parts of the country. Portland has yoga, hipsters, and business people. It is just that we do not take things too seriously.\n\nIn my neighborhood, people have colorful houses and gardens. In the summer, you can find free things on the sidewalk. These are boxes with items people no longer want. You can find clothes, books, or other things. Sometimes you can find something special. This is what Portland is like to me. But everyone is different. Some people like to do yoga with goats or watch soccer games. Other people like to try new things.\n\nPortland has problems. Some people have drug problems. These problems often come from mental health issues. The rain and gray skies may also be a problem. Portland also has people who do not have homes.

But the mountains are special to me. I like to visit them when I need to think. The town is also nice. There are many cafes where I study. The downtown area is old and beautiful. It has old buildings with colorful bricks. This part of town is busy like a big city. But if I walk a little further, I can find a quiet place. The library is near the quiet place. The town has two different feelings. One part is busy and one part is quiet. This is what makes this town special. I have many good memories here. I like walking in the park with friends. I like going to the movies in the theater. But I also have bad memories. Sometimes I go to the pond to think and feel sad. The pond is a good place to think and cry. While I watch the animals at the pond, I think about my life and my place in it. I wonder what I am supposed to do with my life. I walk to the main street and see the sun shining. I look at the mountains and feel strong. The mountains remind me to keep going.",

People call it the \"exercise hill\" because many people like to run up it. There are no sidewalks on my street, so people walk on the road. The road has some holes and can be difficult to drive on. Telephone and electric wires are hung around the neighborhood. They look old. Sometimes strong wind and rain break the wires. This makes the wires look broken. There are many tall trees everywhere. But people do not like the trees. They want to cut them down because they block the view of the ocean. Many houses are built high on the hill. They have big windows to see the ocean. It is nice to see the ocean at sunset. The water looks nice and the sky turns orange. But it is often cloudy and rainy here. The sunlight is blocked by the cloud. The sun does not shine every day. It is often overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything. It even grows on my car. I left my car outside for a month and it became green and hairy with moss. It took me three hours to clean it. There are not many children in my neighborhood. There is a school near my home. But most people in my neighborhood are old and retired. They have dogs instead of children. Dogs run in the street and sometimes enter homes through open doors and windows. It is common to see dogs in lawns and streets. Rabbits are also in the area. They dig up gardens and lawns. My cats like to hunt the rabbits and have chased most of them out of our neighborhood. We also see many birds, including small birds and big birds of prey. They fly over the area until the neighborhood crows chase them away. There are no stores near my home.

It means fall has arrived. \n\nOur garage is at the back of our house. We use the front door only when someone knocks. I like to work in the garage.

Apartments have 2-4 people in each room. There are 4-6 rooms on each floor. One building usually has 2 floors and about 20 people live there. Some houses have 2-4 bedrooms and are rented by school alumni. There are not many of these houses. Most people live in dormitories. A dormitory is a building with many rooms.

The school staff lives in houses, new students live in dormitories, and older students live in apartments. Let's talk about the stores now. My school has many stores. You can find food, clothes, and other things you need. The park is a nice place for everyone to play. It is clean and safe because everyone takes care of it.\n\nMy school is its own neighborhood. You can get everything you need inside the school boundaries. This is a special place.",
            "I have lived in this neighborhood for about 10 years. When I first came, I was sad. I missed my old home in Riverdale. But my parents wanted a better life for me and my sister. We moved to a new house in a good area with a good school.\n\nOver time, I got to know some new friends and some people I did not like. My neighbors were kind to me, especially Mr. Glen and his family. We had fun together, like when we went to his wedding. I caught a special strap Ms. Veda wore on her leg, but I missed catching the flowers! We danced and had a good time.\n\nThe neighborhood is like a big maze. Now I have a GPS, so I can explore it. I like to play video games with my friends Kason and Curtis. We also play games outside, like in the park. The park is nice and calm. It makes me feel peaceful.\n\nI like to bring sticks from the store and practice my balance. I also like to bring my wooden sword and have fun. There is a basketball and tennis court, but I do not play as much as I used to. My dad taught me tennis when I was younger. I had fun playing with him.\n\nI have many good memories in this neighborhood. I hope I will have more in the future.",
            "I live near the college I attend. I like this place. Many apartment buildings are here, some restaurants and bars too. The bars are not very expensive. One bar is new, but it is not very good. Many people are friendly. They are college students or work in lower income jobs. The housing is not very expensive. There is a school near my apartment. Many children live here. I do not know my neighbors. They smoke a lot of marijuana. My building managers put a freshener near their door. It is funny. \n\nThe buildings near me are old but maybe nice inside. A little further down the street are new apartments. I do not like them. They are not well built but cost a lot. The restaurant near me is cheap. They serve food on paper plates and heat it in a microwave. Across from the restaurant is a gas station. It is not a good place to work. But the city fixed the road near my apartment. Now it is nicer. My apartment building has many trees. The city cut some down, but I like the trees. Behind my building are more trees and another apartment complex. The street behind my building is not very nice. The sidewalks are bad and the buildings look old. Many trees hide the buildings' bad looks. There is crime on this street. One apartment complex has a lot of problems. But I like where I live. It is close to the university and I can walk there. There are bus stops nearby too.",
            "My neighborhood is made up of two-house houses on a closed street. The houses are placed far apart and look like separate houses. They are all painted yellow with white porches and green roofs. Most people like each other, but not everyone. We stand at the end of a street some evenings and talk while the small children play outside. It is a nice change from our busy world. It is like going back in time. We are near fields and trees with blue skies and white clouds. \n\nThere is one problem. This season, we have had tornado warnings. One night we heard the warning sirens, and we went to a safe place. My little dog and I went into the bathtub, and my big dog stayed in the living room. The storm was loud, and we could hear big hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the street was hot from the change in temperature. The hail melted when it hit the hot pavement. The sky started to clear, and the sun came out. I saw a beautiful rainbow. I took pictures to share with my friends on Facebook. They were happy, like I was. The people in the neighborhood were quiet for a while after the storm. Then they went back to their normal activities, like cooking dinner. I like this neighborhood because it is friendly. I moved here from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I like the way people talk in the South. I have a two-bedroom apartment like most people. But the apartments are different inside. Some are small. I like to walk in the big field behind my house and visit the small pond. I see deer and hear a big frog singing in the morning. This is a great place to live, just 40 minutes from Charlotte. I like hearing the roosters crowing in the morning. It is like living in a small village. We even have a donkey that brays in the evening. I am lucky to live here.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard to make friends at first. I made friends with two people who lived near me. They no longer live here, but I still think about them. The people who lived here when I first moved here are still living here. My neighborhood is normal. It has many two-story houses. You can hear kids playing outside on weekends. The neighborhood is quiet most days. I have never had problems with my neighbors. I feel safe here. They leave me alone unless I need help. I ordered packages online and they were always safe. I trust my neighbors.\n\nThere is a park near my house. I have many happy memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with my friends. I also got hurt playing football, but the good memories are more important. Now, I go to the park with my cousin's kids. They like playing on swings and slides. The park makes me happy. The neighborhood is different from others. You can find many kinds of food here. There are Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants near here. But many people now use apps to get food delivered. There is a grocery store, Walgreens, CVS, and dry cleaners near here. There is also an Indian store where you can buy Indian food. I like my neighborhood. I see bad things on social media and news about some people's neighbors. I am happy with mine.",
            "My neighborhood is a small town. It is in South Carolina. Johnston is a special place. It is called the Peach Capital of the World. This is what the town says on its welcome sign. Most of Johnston is farmland with peach trees or cattle. Some houses are far apart from the main part of town. They are usually two stories high with metal or gray roofs to keep cool. Most houses are not near the road. They are behind the houses, used for animals and crops.\n\nIn the main part of town, there is a stop light at a four-way intersection. This is where you can find the town's stores. There are three places to get fast food. One is a small Chinese restaurant called Hong Kong. Another is a Mexican restaurant called Fiesta. The third is a small burger place called Gary's. There used to be a pizza place, but it closed.\n\nThere is a small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They are famous for selling Cherry Coca-Cola. The only grocery store in town is called IGA. People usually don't buy much here. They like to go to a big store in a nearby town called Walmart. The most popular store in Johnston is Dollar General. They sell many common things and it is always busy.\n\nThere is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. It has been in Johnston for a long time. The owner is a kind woman. She also employs people to help move furniture. Next to the furniture store is a pet grooming shop called Clark's Cuts. They take care of pets, including feeding, boarding, and grooming.\n\nThe doctor's office and the veterinarian are not in the main part of town. They are small, but they can help the people of Johnston. There is one elementary school called Johnston Elementary. When students finish fifth grade, they go to school in the next town. Johnston is small. There are no parks, but they are building a new place for families to play.\n\nThere is not much to do in Johnston. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or places for people to hang out. But it is a nice town. You can easily miss it if you blink.",
            "I first heard about my neighborhood on a podcast about people who disappeared. This was surprising to me. Almost every apartment in the area costs more than one thousand dollars a month. I had never heard this story before and neither had my friends. Maybe it's because we are struggling. I know some of my friends cry at night because things are expensive. We have learned to be careful with money. We like used things. We like the smell of old toys and clothes that are not used. As people get older, we smell less. We might start to smoke or be used to how things are. But the flea market always reminds us of this. The smell of old magazines on a piano is strong. It stays in the leather even after we wash it. There are three used stores near my home. One is on the far side and has two stores that help charity, a library, a store with old books, and a store with strange things. The streets are very crowded in the city center. Cars and people are everywhere in the morning. But we can't hear the noise in the used stores. Many people and cars go by, but the stores are quiet. It's a nice place to spend an afternoon. More and more people come here every year. The city is growing. It's a big city with one of the biggest internet companies. It's still not perfect. It reminds me of New York. People are focused on their goals and don't ask many questions. We can be alone if we want and people will leave us alone. It's different from the South, where people ask if you care. We can keep to ourselves here and the city will move around us like the ocean waves. This is a lively place to live. There is music near my home. A person plays the piano next door and two people sing upstairs. We come together for important things, like birthdays and help each other when we can. I'm lucky to live here. I like most of my neighbors and they are kind to me. We help each other and leave food for each other. We take care of each other's mail. It's nice to see them and I think they like me too. I live in a big, modern city, but my neighbors make me feel like I'm not alone.",
            "I live in a common type of neighborhood. Many people in my area have well-maintained homes. The homes are all very similar. They have green grass, small stones, and short driveways. Some have small trees. Every house has two cars. The streets are in good condition. There are no holes in the road. Most homes are one story, but some are two stories.\n\nThere are shared mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to get their mail. There are also two big boxes for packages. The neighborhood is near the edge of the city, so it feels like the country and the suburbs. We have a lot of space. There are swimming pools that everyone can use. They are safe and well-maintained. We also have paths where people can walk their dogs or go for a walk.\n\nMost people living here are older. It is a safe place. People look out for each other. We also have some middle-aged and young people. The city is big, but it feels small. We have many things that people need. We have a small mall with many stores. It takes me 15 minutes to drive to the mall. There are many stores with different kinds of food and other things. We have places to buy expensive food and cheap food. My neighborhood is safe, clean, and good. We have nice things like pools and paths. It is easy to get to other places by car.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest. It is near a big city. My neighborhood is on the east side of town. It is an area with lower incomes. People who own homes in this area mostly rent or buy them. The houses are not expensive. However, the neighborhood is not unattractive. People are friendly. They say hello when I walk by. There is a little more crime here than in other areas of town. There have been a few bad incidents near my home. My next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting last year. However, my family has not been hurt by crime. Sometimes we lose small things from our porch if we forget to bring them inside. Our town is affected by a big problem called the opioid epidemic. Many people have died from overdoses. There are many places to help people who are struggling with addiction. The town has good schools. My son's school is excellent. The staff is kind and helpful. My son has a special need, but he is not bullied. The school has a good atmosphere. The teachers and staff do their best to help all students. The school provides food for all students so they do not go hungry. No family is treated unfairly because they cannot pay. The town government has made some changes to improve our town. They have fixed roads, planted trees, and improved the parks. Unfortunately, most of these changes happened in the center of town and on the west side. I like living in this town. People are friendly, the schools are great, and there are many stores to buy things we need. Our home is not worth much, but it is comfortable. We have lived here for over 16 years. We do not want to live anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is very interesting. It's on a hill and has many old buildings. I live in a big apartment building. It's across from a old theater and near a park. People like to go to a cool bar in the park area at night. The park is big for our area. It has a wall with stairs. During the cold months, homeless people set up their tents in rows on the sidewalk and stairs. They do this to stay warm. The rain in our area is heavier than the snow, so it's hard to stay warm. They stay together for warmth and can easily walk to a place where they can wash themselves.\n\nI like my neighborhood. It's not just the old buildings and hills that I like. I like the people. Our neighborhood used to be very bad. There was a lot of violence. The government and police had to come in to clean it up. The people remember this. They still tell stories about it. They work hard to keep their neighborhood clean. They care about what happens in their neighborhood. Some people say white people should not walk around at night. I think this is because of the past. I am not white, but I can pass for white. I think the people in my neighborhood see me as one of them. They are kind to me. They are not mean. People in my neighborhood help each other. A store owner stayed open late so I could charge my phone. Someone gave me money and told me I'm beautiful.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan. It is a quiet place. I like it because it is close to water. I live near two big lakes, Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. You can swim in these lakes.\n\nMy town is not a big city. I do not see big stores like Walmart or Target. We have to drive to get to any store. My neighborhood is special. Houses are not the same. They are old and new, some have been updated. There are many colors of houses. Most houses have yards with trampolines and playsets for kids. Some people have gardens and fences for their animals.\n\nHardworking people live here. They work to make a living and raise families. You can see kids playing outside and people walking dogs or riding bikes. Neighbors know each other and say hello. The lawns are kept clean. The grass is mowed and looks nice.\n\nIt is a safe place to live. The county sheriff's office and jail are near my house. We have a recycling center where people bring their trash. There are baseball fields where you can hear the announcers calling the game. Small planes fly overhead. I can walk to the ice cream shop and to the park. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, which is just a few blocks away. It is a great place to live."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "I live in a big city. My neighborhood is very different. Residential areas and businesses are near each other. Some areas are for offices, stores, restaurants, and entertainment. There are many new restaurants and stores to eat and shop at. Some stores are big and well-known, but small stores are also popular. They are in malls and on the streets. People walk to these stores. There are parks near my neighborhood. I see people with their young children in these parks.\n\nMy neighborhood is very diverse. There are many kinds of people. One area has a community of LGBTQ+ people, Orthodox Jews, and people from the former Soviet Union. Outside my neighborhood, there are many more people of different races and backgrounds. They have their own communities in the city. We have Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia, which are a short drive away. But traffic in my city is very bad. It takes a long time to drive a short distance, especially during rush hour. Almost no one walks in my city. We have a lot of traffic and hard-to-find parking spots.\n\nThe city is getting bigger. New apartment buildings are being built. Many people are moving to the city. Some residents do not want more people and traffic. There are many kinds of houses in my city. Not everyone lives in big apartment buildings. We have houses of different sizes and smaller buildings. Some homes are for one family, and others are for two families. My neighborhood is also made up of people of different ages. I do not know most of my neighbors. My neighborhood is not close like it used to be. I have good memories of playing with my friends when I was a child.",
            "My neighborhood is very interesting. Most houses are for one family. But some houses have been split into two. They are still connected. My home has a small front yard and a small driveway to the side. My neighborhood looks like it did a long time ago. People wanted to live in the suburbs then. It seemed like a good life. But now it is not the same. Many people still live here. They still like it. The people are not as happy as they used to be. The yards are not as nice as they used to be. But there are still cars in the driveways. The kids still play. They think the world is their whole world. A public school has been here for almost 90 years. It still stands. It makes the young people think about the future. It makes the older people remember the past. There are few churches. They are not very full. The basketball courts are always full. All the houses are different. But they feel the same. There is a big store called \"A\". It is owned by a big Yemeni family. They may be the only Arab family in the neighborhood. Most of the people are African American. The streets are wide. The kids usually play football. They stop to let cars pass. Most people have lived here for many years. They can tell stories about when everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school. But now it is a pharmacy. Kids do not want to be like Daniel-san anymore. There is a small movie theater. It shows old movies at a lower price. The young people do not like it. They think it is old-fashioned. The older people like it. They think it is a good way to spend the night out. There is one highway that goes through our town. The entrance and exit are in the next town. People wanted to put an entrance and exit in our town. But the older people said no. They said it would make our town less nice. The city agreed with them. They are building a new school. We are choosing a symbol for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be a good symbol for my town.",
            "You might not see it at first. This is a residential area behind a shopping strip. People do not usually live here. At least, not many people want to live here. But if you go behind the old shopping center and walk to the back, you will find a community. There are many apartment buildings here. They are close together like a line of boxes.\n\nThe first group of apartments has bad news. We will not talk about it much. It looks bad, but it is not all bad. The other apartment buildings are nice. Many people live here. Across from these buildings is a college. It is a small group of buildings. Students go there to learn. They are quiet and sleepy in the morning. They drink coffee and go to class.\n\nThe road goes through this area. It meets another road. On one side is a park. Children play here. They run around and play games. On the other side is a place to help people with broken bones. The porch is nice and there is a fan to cool the air.\n\nMany people live in this area. They walk their dogs and go to the park. Some teenagers ride skateboards and talk to their friends. There is a place to buy food, a store for swimming pools, and a place for people to get manicures. You can buy food, fill your pool, and get a manicure all at the same time. There is also a place to buy frozen yogurt. Many teenagers like to eat frozen yogurt and ride their skateboards.\n\nThis is a special place. It is a part of American history. Nothing much changes here. Time goes slowly.",
            "We drove through a big area with many corn fields. \"What is this place?\" she asked. \"This is it,\" I said. She was from a city where a store was just a short walk from her house. She had never seen so much open space before. I told her about where I grew up in rural Ohio. She understood who I was and where I came from.\n\nWe drove down a small road. We passed a big hole in the ground with water in it. My home was just beyond that. My neighborhood has houses made of brick and stucco. Each house has a big piece of land. People take care of their land and are very proud of it. In the spring, we plant flowers and trees. The trees change color with the seasons. The driveways have nice cars, like Mercedes. They shine in the sun after a car wash.\n\nMy neighbor was outside. He was a doctor in his younger years. Now he is older and has a lawn mower. He mows his lawn all day and sings while he works. Everyone likes him. He is a kind person with a special story.\n\nWe finally arrived at my home. There are geese in the yard. Our dog chases them. Behind my house, there is a small stream that flows into the hole in the ground. You can hear frogs, water, and animals from the farms nearby. There is a bridge made of wood over the stream. On the other side, there are trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This is where I spent most of my childhood. I built forts and played with my friends. We had snow in the winter. The trees were bare and looked like skeletons. Sometimes it snowed and our yard looked like a winter wonderland. My sister and I would make snowmen and snow angels. We would fight and use snowballs as our weapons. We built forts and had fun in the snow.",
            "Portland, Oregon is a special place. Some say it is \"weird\". This is shown by the town slogan, \"Keep Portland Weird\". It is written on a building that has a pizza joint, a bar, a music place, and a place where people dance. People like this slogan. To some, it means keep the old Portland alive. This is the Portland from the 1990s and early 2000s. It was not as famous and not as expensive. It made new and creative cultures. To others, it means come to Portland, where people like being different.\n\nMany rich people from California have moved to Portland. New houses are being built. But Portland is still weird. Weird means accepting things that others do not accept. But it does not mean Portland does not have new things. We buy things from China like other parts of the country. There are many ways to be weird. But Portland also has normal things. We have yoga, hipsters, and business people. Maybe being weird means not taking things too seriously.\n\nI live in a neighborhood with colorful houses, gardens, and boxes. Boxes are free things people give away. They can be used boxes or plastic bags. Inside the boxes, you can find nice things, like clothes and books. You can find anything. This is what Portland is all about. Or at least, it is what Portland is all about to me. There are many kinds of weird people in Portland. Some people will never pick up things from a box. They will go to goat yoga or watch the soccer team, the Timbers.\n\nPortland is full of people who love many things. We have people who chase our dreams, or think about chasing our dreams while we drink too much at the bar. Portland has problems. We have a drug problem. It usually comes from mental health problems. The rain and clouds can make people feel sad. We also have a homelessness problem. Many people come here because we have good services. But our services are not enough. People who have homes are sometimes kind, sometimes angry. This is the same in other parts of the country. We are not weird in feeling this way.",
            "There are mountains in the north. They watch the sun every day. They see the sun come up and go down. They are always there. I forget about them sometimes. Work and life take my attention. But they are still there. They are strong and steady. They do not change. When I am very stressed, I think about them. They remind me to take a deep breath and to be strong. I moved here when I started college. The mountains near my school were beautiful. I loved them at first. The school has nice buildings and a pond. But the mountains are special to me. The town is nice too. There are many coffee shops where I studied. I can walk or take a bus to the downtown area. It is old and interesting. There are old buildings and restaurants. It is busy and exciting. But it is not busy for long. I can go back to a quiet part of town. The library is there. It is a place to rest. I like this town because it is different in different parts. It is a nice place to live. I have good memories here. I walked with friends in the park. We went to the movies in a nice theater. But I also have sad memories. We all have sad memories. The ponds are a good place to think and cry. I went to the pond at night and wondered about my life. I looked at the animals and thought about my purpose. I walked to the main street and saw the sun. The sun was shining and made the sky beautiful. I looked at the mountains and I felt strong. They reminded me to be strong and to keep going.",
            "If you plan to visit Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, you will have no trouble finding it. The city has good public transportation. Bensonhurst is a busy neighborhood like the rest of New York City. You will see many Asian stores as you walk. Many Asian people live in Bensonhurst. This is why you will find an Asian store on almost every block. Supermarkets and laundromats are popular. People like these stores because food is good, prices are low, and they are easy to use.\n\nNear my home, there are four Asian supermarkets within a short walk. This is helpful for buying groceries. Bensonhurst is a mixed area. Many immigrants and their children live here. Some big businesses in the area are owned by Asian people. There is also a park nearby.

People call it the \"work-out hill\" because many runners like to run up the hill. The houses are built high up so people can see the ocean.\n\nThere are many tall trees around my house. People do not like the trees because they block the view of the ocean. But the trees are nice when the sun sets. The water looks nice and the sky turns orange.\n\nIt often rains and storms in our area. Moss grows on everything, including houses, cars and railings. One time I left my car outside for a month and it got covered in moss. It took me three hours to clean it off.\n\nThere are not many children in my neighborhood. The people are mostly older and many are retired. They have dogs instead of children. The dogs are always running around and sometimes they get into people's houses.\n\nWe have many wild rabbits. They dig up gardens and burrow into lawns. My cats like to catch them and there are not many rabbits left in our neighborhood.\n\nWe see many birds, like small birds and hummingbirds. Sometimes a hawk or eagle comes by, but the crows chase it away.\n\nThere are no stores in my neighborhood. But if you walk down to the waterfront, you can find some restaurants that serve fresh seafood. The beach is not very big, but it is fun to throw rocks into the water.",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. My house is on a street between two main roads. This means we have some traffic, but it is a quiet neighborhood. People do not move in and out often. I know most of my neighbors. They work in their yards and do other daily things. In the winter, we sled down a small hill. We live at the corner of the street. We see all the people who come and go. We take note of strangers' cars. Some neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Children ride their bikes. We work from home. There are four of us: my wife, our two daughters, and me. We are at home a lot. We go outside and play, even in the rain. We sometimes grill on our back deck. It smells good. We hear lawn mowers almost every day from March to October. It is a wooded area, so we have trees and shade. We rake and burn leaves in the fall. I like the smell of burning leaves. It means fall is here. We do not have much winter. It feels like a long fall. My garage is at the back of the house. I like to work on my truck in the garage. When the doors are open, I feel close to my neighbors. On holidays, it is quiet. We have visitors on Thanksgiving and other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. I like living here. If the street were not a main road, it would be perfect.",
            "I live in a neighborhood in the middle of a dry and sandy area. This area is very different from many other places. When you look around, you see mostly brown and dirt. It is not very green like some other places. Sometimes I see a small green area, like a lawn. But this is very expensive to take care of. When I first moved here, there were many houses far apart. Now there are more houses, and it looks like a small city.\n\nPeople in my neighborhood are generally friendly. But, like any place, it has good and bad parts. Many old people live in my neighborhood, and it is a nice place. There are some stores, but not many. Most of the stores are part of big chains, like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want to buy healthy food, you have to go somewhere else. My city is not very developed, and there are many open spaces. This is why many people work in construction. I work in construction, too. I install drywall and T-bars for a living.\n\nI like my neighborhood because of the animals. People come to our area to see the beauty of the desert. The desert has a special climate and geography that supports many different kinds of wildlife. People who live here should learn about the animals that live here so we can live together safely. My family loves animals, and we have learned a lot about them. We even try to catch them when we can. If you come to visit, there are some things to see. Victorville is a good place for families to learn about the desert. You can visit the San Bernardino County Fair, which is a fun event. You can also visit Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and learn winter sports. If you are interested in the natural history and culture of the desert, you can visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has many interesting things to see, like rocks, old bones, and Native American artifacts.",
            "My neighborhood is the college campus where I live. I live in a dormitory with many people from different countries and ages. My neighborhood also includes the campus area around my dorm. I like my neighborhood. It has many things like homes, people, stores, and a park.\n\nLet's talk about the homes in my neighborhood. There are three kinds of homes. Some are apartments, some are houses, and some are dorm rooms. Apartments have 2-4 people in each room. There are 4-6 rooms on each floor. Some buildings are 2 floors high. So, about 20 people live in each building. Some houses are for rent. They have 2-4 bedrooms. Only a few people live in these houses. Most students live in dorm rooms. Two people share a room, sometimes.\n\nMy college is proud of its diversity. People from many countries and ages live in my neighborhood. Some staff members live in houses. New students live in dorms and older students live in apartments. Let's talk about the stores and park. My school is a closed neighborhood. It has many stores and one park. The stores have food, clothes, and things we need. We can buy anything we need in our neighborhood. The park is a fun place for everyone. It is clean and safe because all neighbors take care of it.",
            "I have lived in this neighborhood for 10 years. I am happy to share what I know about it. When I first came here, I was sad. I missed my friends and family from Riverdale. My mom and dad wanted the best for me and my sister, so we moved to Stockbridge. Our new neighborhood was better. It had good housing and a good high school. I made new friends and enemies in school. I did not get to know my neighbors very well, but I liked Mr. Glen and his children. They are kind people. I remember their wedding. My family and I attended. We had a good time. I even caught a white strap that Mrs. Glen took off her leg. I did not catch the flowers, though. I like to visit the park and walk in nature. It makes me feel calm. I also like to practice my balance with sticks. I have a wooden sword that I like to play with. There is a basketball and tennis court. I used to play tennis with my dad and Mr. Graves. We had fun, but we worked hard. I hope I can play again. I have had some happy times in this neighborhood. I think there is more to come.",
            "I live near the college I attend. It is very convenient for me. Many apartment buildings are in my area. Some are old, but they have been renovated inside. There are also some restaurants and bars. They are fun to go to and not very expensive. One bar changed its name recently. It is a bit more expensive, but the service and drinks are good.\n\nMost people in my area are students or have low incomes. They live in apartments because they are not very expensive. There is an elementary school near my home. Many children live in the area. My neighbors are not very friendly. They smoke a lot. I do not want to know them.\n\nMy apartment building is old, but it has a lot of trees around it. Some trees were cut down, but there are still many trees. The street behind my building has another set of apartments. The street next to mine is not as nice. The sidewalks are bad, and the buildings look old. There are many trees on that street to hide the bad buildings. Much crime happens on that street. But crime happens in other places too.\n\nI like where I live. I can afford it. There are many good things near my home. The college is close, and I can easily ride a bus to go shopping or downtown.",
            "My neighborhood has duplex homes on a circle street. They look like individual houses. Each one is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone is friends with each other. We stand at the end of our driveways sometimes and talk while our children play outside. It is nice to be in a place without many cars and computers. It is like going back in time.\n\nWe are surrounded by fields, trees, and blue skies with white clouds. But we also have problems. This season, we have had tornado warnings. Last night, we heard the tornado sirens. We went to our shelter. I was in my bathtub with my small dog and a few things. My big dog stayed in the living room. It was quiet outside except for the sound of hail on the ground.\n\nAfter the storm, the road was hot. We had a big change in temperature. The hail melted on the hot pavement. The sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow happened. I took pictures with my camera. My friends were impressed. The neighborhood stayed quiet for a little while. Then people came home from wherever they were.\n\nWe have a good community. We are close to the city of Charlotte. Every morning, we hear roosters crowing from the nearby farms. It is like living in a small village. We even have a donkey that brays in the evening. I am lucky to live here.\n\nWe have duplex homes on our street. Each one looks the same from the outside. But the inside is different. Some are small. I like to walk in the big field behind my house. I see deer and hear a bullfrog singing in the morning. It is a great place to live. We have a pond that is not for swimming. I like it here, 40 minutes from the city.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood one year before I started eighth grade. It was hard to make friends at first, but I made two friends who lived near me. One lives two houses down, and the other lives on my street. They do not live there anymore, but I still have happy memories. The people who lived here when I first moved here are still here. My neighborhood is like many American neighborhoods. It has two-story houses and a park. I like this about my neighborhood.\n\nEvery weekend, I hear kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days. I have never had a problem with anyone in my neighborhood. They leave you alone unless you need help. I have ordered many packages online and they have never been stolen from my porch.\n\nThe park is near my house. I have happy memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with my friends. But I also got hurt playing football. The good memories are more important. When I go to the park now, I spend time with my little cousin's kids. They like playing on swings and slides. The park makes me feel happy and sad at the same time.\n\nMy neighborhood is diverse. You can find many kinds of food nearby. There are Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants within a short distance. Many people use apps to get food delivered. There are also fast food shops and pizza places. The stores near my house have everything we need. There are dry cleaners, a pharmacy, and a grocery store. There are even stores that sell Indian food. I like my neighborhood.\n\nWhen I read about problems with neighbors on social media, I feel happy to have the friends and neighborhood I have.",
            "I live in a small town in South Carolina. It is not a big town, but it is important for farming. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World. This is what the welcome sign says. The town is mostly farmland with many peach trees and cattle. The houses are far apart and two stories high. They have metal or gray roofs to keep out the hot sun. Most houses are not near the road. They are far back so people can use the front land for animals and crops.\n\nIn the main part of town, there is one traffic light. This is where you will find the town's stores. There are three places to get fast food. One is Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant. Another is Fiesta Mexican Restaurant. The third is Gary's, a small burger place. There used to be a pizzeria, but it is closed now.\n\nThere is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. People like to buy Cherry Coca-Cola there. There is one grocery store called IGA. It is not very big, so people often go to a bigger store in another town. The most popular store is Dollar General. It sells many things and is very busy. There is a furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. They deliver the furniture you buy. Next to the store is a place to take care of your pet called Clark's Cuts and Kennels.\n\nThe doctor and the vet are in separate buildings outside the main part of town. They are small, but they can help the people of Johnston. There is one school called Johnston Elementary School. When students finish fifth grade, they go to school in the next town. We are making a new park with a playground and other fun things. But right now, there is not much to do in our town. We do not have a movie theater, bowling alley, or many restaurants. But it is a nice town. You can easily miss it if you are driving by!",
            "I first heard about my town on a podcast. It was about people who were missing. I was surprised. Almost every apartment in my area is expensive. It costs over one thousand dollars a month. I had not heard about this story before. My friends did not know about it either. Maybe it is hard for people to hear. I know some of my friends cry at night. Life is expensive, but we have learned to save money. We like second-hand things. We like the smell of old toys and old clothes. When you grow up, you smell less. As an adult, you might smoke or you might just be used to things being this way. But the flea market is always there. The smell of old magazines on a piano is strong. It stays in the leather even after you wash it.\n\nThere are three second-hand stores near my home. If you start on one side, you can visit two charity stores, a library, and a store with old books. Downtown is busy. Cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you cannot hear it in the thrift stores. No matter how many people or cars go by, the stores are quiet. It is a nice place to spend the afternoon. Every year, more and more people come to downtown. It is a growing city. One of the biggest companies for online shopping and delivery is here. It is still getting bigger. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is busy with their own goals. No one asks you for help. You can be alone and people will leave you alone. It is different from the South. In the South, people care about each other. They ask questions. You can keep to yourself in this city and it will not matter. It is a lively place to be. There is music from the man who plays the piano next door and the two singers upstairs. There is always something going on. We have less of an apartment of strangers and more of a community of friends. We help each other when we need it. We celebrate birthdays and help each other when someone dies. I am lucky to live here. I like most of my neighbors. They treat me well. I try to clean up after myself and I leave food for them. They do the same for me. It is nice to see them and I think they like my company as much as I like theirs. I live in a big, modern city, but it is my neighbors who make me feel good about my life.",
            "I live in a typical suburban area. My neighborhood is very nice. It looks very well taken care of. The houses are all single family homes. The homeowner's association helps keep everything nice. The front yards are all the same. They have small lawns, some small rocks, and short driveways. Some houses have two cars. As you drive around the neighborhood, you see new concrete roads. The roads are good. There are no potholes. Most houses are one story, but some are two stories. We don't have mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, there are many boxes at the end of the street. You need a key to get your mail. There are two big boxes for packages.\n\nMy house is at the edge of the city. It's a mix of country and suburbs. We have a lot of space. There are many pools that everyone can use. They are well kept and locked. There are paths where you can walk your dog or take a walk. You don't need to go to a park to get exercise. The neighborhood is big, so you can run around it and get exercise. Many people who live here are retired. It's a safe area and people look out for each other. We also have some young and middle-aged people. The city is big in population, but it has a small town feel. We have many things you need, like a mall. It's not very big, but it's enough. I can drive 15 minutes and find many stores. There are high-end stores with organic food and stores with low prices and few employees. My neighborhood is safe, clean, and nice. We have many good things, like pools and walking paths. If we need to go shopping, we can drive to a big store.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest. It is near a big city. My neighborhood is on the east side of the town. Many people who live here have low incomes. The houses are not expensive. My neighbors are friendly. They say hello when I walk down the street. There is some crime in the area. A few people have been hurt in shootings. Our next-door neighbors' son was killed in a shooting last year. We have not been hurt by crime. Sometimes we lose small things from our porch.\n\nThe town is having problems with a sickness from a drug called fentanyl. Many people have died from it. But there are places to help people with addiction. My son goes to a good school. He has extra help because he needs it. He has friends and teachers who care about him. He loves his school. The school gives free food to all students. No one is treated differently because they do not have enough money.\n\nThe town is improving. They have fixed some roads and parks. But most of the changes are on the west side of town. My neighborhood is not as nice as some other parts of town. We like living here. People are friendly, the schools are good, and there are many stores to buy things. Our home is not worth a lot of money, but it is comfortable.\n\nWe have lived here for over 16 years. We do not want to live anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It is on a hill. Many old buildings are there. I live in a seven-story apartment building near an old theater. Across the street is a fun bar that people like to visit on warm summer nights. People wait in line to get in on weekends during June and July.\n\nNearby is a big park. It is nice for the area. The park has concrete around it and wide stairs. During cold winter months, homeless people set up tents. It is warmer for them to be close together.\n\nI like my city's culture. It is not just about old buildings. The people are special. My neighborhood used to be bad because of gang violence. But the people work hard to keep it clean. They care about their city.\n\nSome people say if you are white, do not walk around at night. I think this is a reminder of the past. I am not white. I think the people like me because I understand their problems. They are kind to me. They help me.\n\nI feel good walking at night. People are nice. A laundromat owner let me charge my phone when I had no place to go. Someone gave me money and told me I am beautiful. The people here are special. I feel alive here.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan. It is a peaceful place. The town is near two big lakes, Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. I like living here. It is a safe place. I can walk to many places. There is a park not far from my house. My neighborhood is quiet. Houses are not close together. They are old homes that have been updated. Many houses have yards with trampolines and playsets. People take care of their lawns. The grass is cut and the plants are trimmed.\n\nIt is a good place to raise a family. You can see children playing outside. People know each other in this town. They say hello when they see each other. The town has a sheriff's department and a health department. There is a recycling center where people take their trash. We also have baseball and softball fields. You can hear the announcers calling the games. There is a small airport near my house. I can hear the planes taking off and landing.\n\nI like my neighborhood. It is not perfect, but it is a good place to live. It is safe and peaceful. My kids can ride their bikes to the park. It is only a few blocks away. I can walk to get ice cream from a local shop. It is a great place to live."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "I live in a big city. My neighborhood is very different. Residential areas and businesses are near each other. Some areas are for offices, stores, restaurants, and entertainment. There are many new restaurants and stores to eat and shop at. Some stores are big and well-known, but small stores are also popular. They are in malls and on the streets. People walk to these stores. There are parks near my neighborhood. I see people with their young children in these parks.\n\nMy neighborhood is very diverse. There are many kinds of people. One area has a community of LGBTQ+ people, Orthodox Jews, and people from the former Soviet Union. Outside my neighborhood, there are many more people of different races and backgrounds. They have their own communities in the city. We have Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia, which are a short drive away. But traffic in my city is very bad. It takes a long time to drive a short distance, especially during rush hour. Almost no one walks in my city. We have a lot of traffic and hard-to-find parking spots.\n\nThe city is getting bigger. New apartment buildings are being built. Many people are moving to the city. Some residents do not want more people and traffic. There are many kinds of houses in my city. Not everyone lives in big apartment buildings. We have houses of different sizes and smaller buildings. Some homes are for one family, and others are for two families. My neighborhood is also made up of people of different ages. I do not know most of my neighbors. My neighborhood is not close like it used to be. I have good memories of playing with my friends when I was a child.",
            "My neighborhood is very interesting. Most houses are for one family. But some houses have been split into two. They are still connected. My home has a small front yard and a small driveway to the side. My neighborhood looks like it did a long time ago. People wanted to live in the suburbs then. It seemed like a good life. But now it is not the same. Many people still live here. They still like it. The people are not as happy as they used to be. The yards are not as nice as they used to be. But there are still cars in the driveways. The kids still play. They think the world is their whole world. A public school has been here for almost 90 years. It still stands. It makes the young people think about the future. It makes the older people remember the past. There are few churches. They are not very full. The basketball courts are always full. All the houses are different. But they feel the same. There is a big store called \"A\". It is owned by a big Yemeni family. They may be the only Arab family in the neighborhood. Most of the people are African American. The streets are wide. The kids usually play football. They stop to let cars pass. Most people have lived here for many years. They can tell stories about when everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school. But now it is a pharmacy. Kids do not want to be like Daniel-san anymore. There is a small movie theater. It shows old movies at a lower price. The young people do not like it. They think it is old-fashioned. The older people like it. They think it is a good way to spend the night out. There is one highway that goes through our town. The entrance and exit are in the next town. People wanted to put an entrance and exit in our town. But the older people said no. They said it would make our town less nice. The city agreed with them. They are building a new school. We are choosing a symbol for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be a good symbol for my town.",
            "You might not see it at first. This is a residential area behind a shopping strip. People do not usually live here. At least, not many people want to live here. But if you go behind the old shopping center and walk to the back, you will find a community. There are many apartment buildings here. They are close together like a line of boxes.\n\nThe first group of apartments has bad news. We will not talk about it much. It looks bad, but it is not all bad. The other apartment buildings are nice. Many people live here. Across from these buildings is a college. It is a small group of buildings. Students go there to learn. They are quiet and sleepy in the morning. They drink coffee and go to class.\n\nThe road goes through this area. It meets another road. On one side is a park. Children play here. They run around and play games. On the other side is a place to help people with broken bones. The porch is nice and there is a fan to cool the air.\n\nMany people live in this area. They walk their dogs and go to the park. Some teenagers ride skateboards and talk to their friends. There is a place to buy food, a store for swimming pools, and a place for people to get manicures. You can buy food, fill your pool, and get a manicure all at the same time. There is also a place to buy frozen yogurt. Many teenagers like to eat frozen yogurt and ride their skateboards.\n\nThis is a special place. It is a part of American history. Nothing much changes here. Time goes slowly.",
            "We drove through a big area with many corn fields. \"What is this place?\" she asked. \"This is it,\" I said. She was from a city where a store was just a short walk from her house. She had never seen so much open space before. I told her about where I grew up in rural Ohio. She understood who I was and where I came from.\n\nWe drove down a small road. We passed a big hole in the ground with water in it. My home was just beyond that. My neighborhood has houses made of brick and stucco. Each house has a big piece of land. People take care of their land and are very proud of it. In the spring, we plant flowers and trees. The trees change color with the seasons. The driveways have nice cars, like Mercedes. They shine in the sun after a car wash.\n\nMy neighbor was outside. He was a doctor in his younger years. Now he is older and has a lawn mower. He mows his lawn all day and sings while he works. Everyone likes him. He is a kind person with a special story.\n\nWe finally arrived at my home. There are geese in the yard. Our dog chases them. Behind my house, there is a small stream that flows into the hole in the ground. You can hear frogs, water, and animals from the farms nearby. There is a bridge made of wood over the stream. On the other side, there are trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This is where I spent most of my childhood. I built forts and played with my friends. We had snow in the winter. The trees were bare and looked like skeletons. Sometimes it snowed and our yard looked like a winter wonderland. My sister and I would make snowmen and snow angels. We would fight and use snowballs as our weapons. We built forts and had fun in the snow.",
            "Portland, Oregon is a special place. Some say it is \"weird\". This is shown by the town slogan, \"Keep Portland Weird\". It is written on a building that has a pizza joint, a bar, a music place, and a place where people dance. People like this slogan. To some, it means keep the old Portland alive. This is the Portland from the 1990s and early 2000s. It was not as famous and not as expensive. It made new and creative cultures. To others, it means come to Portland, where people like being different.\n\nMany rich people from California have moved to Portland. New houses are being built. But Portland is still weird. Weird means accepting things that others do not accept. But it does not mean Portland does not have new things. We buy things from China like other parts of the country. There are many ways to be weird. But Portland also has normal things. We have yoga, hipsters, and business people. Maybe being weird means not taking things too seriously.\n\nI live in a neighborhood with colorful houses, gardens, and boxes. Boxes are free things people give away. They can be used boxes or plastic bags. Inside the boxes, you can find nice things, like clothes and books. You can find anything. This is what Portland is all about. Or at least, it is what Portland is all about to me. There are many kinds of weird people in Portland. Some people will never pick up things from a box. They will go to goat yoga or watch the soccer team, the Timbers.\n\nPortland is full of people who love many things. We have people who chase our dreams, or think about chasing our dreams while we drink too much at the bar. Portland has problems. We have a drug problem. It usually comes from mental health problems. The rain and clouds can make people feel sad. We also have a homelessness problem. Many people come here because we have good services. But our services are not enough. People who have homes are sometimes kind, sometimes angry. This is the same in other parts of the country. We are not weird in feeling this way.",
            "There are mountains in the north. They watch the sun every day. They see the sun come up and go down. They are always there. I forget about them sometimes. Work and life take my attention. But they are still there. They are strong and steady. They do not change. When I am very stressed, I think about them. They remind me to take a deep breath and to be strong. I moved here when I started college. The mountains near my school were beautiful. I loved them at first. The school has nice buildings and a pond. But the mountains are special to me. The town is nice too. There are many coffee shops where I studied. I can walk or take a bus to the downtown area. It is old and interesting. There are old buildings and restaurants. It is busy and exciting. But it is not busy for long. I can go back to a quiet part of town. The library is there. It is a place to rest. I like this town because it is different in different parts. It is a nice place to live. I have good memories here. I walked with friends in the park. We went to the movies in a nice theater. But I also have sad memories. We all have sad memories. The ponds are a good place to think and cry. I went to the pond at night and wondered about my life. I looked at the animals and thought about my purpose. I walked to the main street and saw the sun. The sun was shining and made the sky beautiful. I looked at the mountains and I felt strong. They reminded me to be strong and to keep going.",
            "If you plan to visit Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, you will have no trouble finding it. The city has good public transportation. Bensonhurst is a busy neighborhood like the rest of New York City. You will see many Asian stores as you walk. Many Asian people live in Bensonhurst. This is why you will find an Asian store on almost every block. Supermarkets and laundromats are popular. People like these stores because food is good, prices are low, and they are easy to use.\n\nNear my home, there are four Asian supermarkets within a short walk. This is helpful for buying groceries. Bensonhurst is a mixed area. Many immigrants and their children live here. Some big businesses in the area are owned by Asian people. There is also a park nearby. The park has many basketball courts, a big field for soccer or baseball, handball courts, a playground for children, and a water fountain for kids to play in during the summer.\n\nThe area has many small homes and co-op buildings. Few big buildings are here. Many people are friendly, but some can be noisy. Cars often play music loudly as they drive by. You may hear a car starting quickly in the morning. At night, be careful. Some people can be mean. You may meet people who want to cause trouble. I was once bullied here. But that was a long time ago. Recently, someone took a package from my home. This is a common problem in Bensonhurst. People do not clean up after their dogs. Every day, you will see dog waste on the street. This is my biggest problem.",
            "I live in a place with few sidewalks. People have to walk on the road because there are no sidewalks. The road can be a little bit bad to drive on because it has holes in some places. There are many telephone and electric wires above the road. They look bad because they get broken in storms and need to be fixed many times.\n\nMy house is at the top of the biggest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work-out hill\" because many runners like to run up the hill. The houses are built high up so people can see the ocean.\n\nThere are many tall trees around my house. People do not like the trees because they block the view of the ocean. But the trees are nice when the sun sets. The water looks nice and the sky turns orange.\n\nIt often rains and storms in our area. Moss grows on everything, including houses, cars and railings. One time I left my car outside for a month and it got covered in moss. It took me three hours to clean it off.\n\nThere are not many children in my neighborhood. The people are mostly older and many are retired. They have dogs instead of children. The dogs are always running around and sometimes they get into people's houses.\n\nWe have many wild rabbits. They dig up gardens and burrow into lawns. My cats like to catch them and there are not many rabbits left in our neighborhood.\n\nWe see many birds, like small birds and hummingbirds. Sometimes a hawk or eagle comes by, but the crows chase it away.\n\nThere are no stores in my neighborhood. But if you walk down to the waterfront, you can find some restaurants that serve fresh seafood. The beach is not very big, but it is fun to throw rocks into the water.",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. My house is on a street between two main roads. This means we have some traffic, but it is a quiet neighborhood. People do not move in and out often. I know most of my neighbors. They work in their yards and do other daily things. In the winter, we sled down a small hill. We live at the corner of the street. We see all the people who come and go. We take note of strangers' cars. Some neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Children ride their bikes. We work from home. There are four of us: my wife, our two daughters, and me. We are at home a lot. We go outside and play, even in the rain. We sometimes grill on our back deck. It smells good. We hear lawn mowers almost every day from March to October. It is a wooded area, so we have trees and shade. We rake and burn leaves in the fall. I like the smell of burning leaves. It means fall is here. We do not have much winter. It feels like a long fall. My garage is at the back of the house. I like to work on my truck in the garage. When the doors are open, I feel close to my neighbors. On holidays, it is quiet. We have visitors on Thanksgiving and other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. I like living here. If the street were not a main road, it would be perfect.",
            "I live in a neighborhood in the middle of a dry and sandy area. This area is very different from many other places. When you look around, you see mostly brown and dirt. It is not very green like some other places. Sometimes I see a small green area, like a lawn. But this is very expensive to take care of. When I first moved here, there were many houses far apart. Now there are more houses, and it looks like a small city.\n\nPeople in my neighborhood are generally friendly. But, like any place, it has good and bad parts. Many old people live in my neighborhood, and it is a nice place. There are some stores, but not many. Most of the stores are part of big chains, like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want to buy healthy food, you have to go somewhere else. My city is not very developed, and there are many open spaces. This is why many people work in construction. I work in construction, too. I install drywall and T-bars for a living.\n\nI like my neighborhood because of the animals. People come to our area to see the beauty of the desert. The desert has a special climate and geography that supports many different kinds of wildlife. People who live here should learn about the animals that live here so we can live together safely. My family loves animals, and we have learned a lot about them. We even try to catch them when we can. If you come to visit, there are some things to see. Victorville is a good place for families to learn about the desert. You can visit the San Bernardino County Fair, which is a fun event. You can also visit Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and learn winter sports. If you are interested in the natural history and culture of the desert, you can visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has many interesting things to see, like rocks, old bones, and Native American artifacts.",
            "My neighborhood is the college campus where I live. I live in a dormitory with many people from different countries and ages. My neighborhood also includes the campus area around my dorm. I like my neighborhood. It has many things like homes, people, stores, and a park.\n\nLet's talk about the homes in my neighborhood. There are three kinds of homes. Some are apartments, some are houses, and some are dorm rooms. Apartments have 2-4 people in each room. There are 4-6 rooms on each floor. Some buildings are 2 floors high. So, about 20 people live in each building. Some houses are for rent. They have 2-4 bedrooms. Only a few people live in these houses. Most students live in dorm rooms. Two people share a room, sometimes.\n\nMy college is proud of its diversity. People from many countries and ages live in my neighborhood. Some staff members live in houses. New students live in dorms and older students live in apartments. Let's talk about the stores and park. My school is a closed neighborhood. It has many stores and one park. The stores have food, clothes, and things we need. We can buy anything we need in our neighborhood. The park is a fun place for everyone. It is clean and safe because all neighbors take care of it.",
            "I have lived in this neighborhood for 10 years. I am happy to share what I know about it. When I first came here, I was sad. I missed my friends and family from Riverdale. My mom and dad wanted the best for me and my sister, so we moved to Stockbridge. Our new neighborhood was better. It had good housing and a good high school. I made new friends and enemies in school. I did not get to know my neighbors very well, but I liked Mr. Glen and his children. They are kind people. I remember their wedding. My family and I attended. We had a good time. I even caught a white strap that Mrs. Glen took off her leg. I did not catch the flowers, though. I like to visit the park and walk in nature. It makes me feel calm. I also like to practice my balance with sticks. I have a wooden sword that I like to play with. There is a basketball and tennis court. I used to play tennis with my dad and Mr. Graves. We had fun, but we worked hard. I hope I can play again. I have had some happy times in this neighborhood. I think there is more to come.",
            "I live near the college I attend. It is very convenient for me. Many apartment buildings are in my area. Some are old, but they have been renovated inside. There are also some restaurants and bars. They are fun to go to and not very expensive. One bar changed its name recently. It is a bit more expensive, but the service and drinks are good.\n\nMost people in my area are students or have low incomes. They live in apartments because they are not very expensive. There is an elementary school near my home. Many children live in the area. My neighbors are not very friendly. They smoke a lot. I do not want to know them.\n\nMy apartment building is old, but it has a lot of trees around it. Some trees were cut down, but there are still many trees. The street behind my building has another set of apartments. The street next to mine is not as nice. The sidewalks are bad, and the buildings look old. There are many trees on that street to hide the bad buildings. Much crime happens on that street. But crime happens in other places too.\n\nI like where I live. I can afford it. There are many good things near my home. The college is close, and I can easily ride a bus to go shopping or downtown.",
            "My neighborhood has duplex homes on a circle street. They look like individual houses. Each one is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone is friends with each other. We stand at the end of our driveways sometimes and talk while our children play outside. It is nice to be in a place without many cars and computers. It is like going back in time.\n\nWe are surrounded by fields, trees, and blue skies with white clouds. But we also have problems. This season, we have had tornado warnings. Last night, we heard the tornado sirens. We went to our shelter. I was in my bathtub with my small dog and a few things. My big dog stayed in the living room. It was quiet outside except for the sound of hail on the ground.\n\nAfter the storm, the road was hot. We had a big change in temperature. The hail melted on the hot pavement. The sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow happened. I took pictures with my camera. My friends were impressed. The neighborhood stayed quiet for a little while. Then people came home from wherever they were.\n\nWe have a good community. We are close to the city of Charlotte. Every morning, we hear roosters crowing from the nearby farms. It is like living in a small village. We even have a donkey that brays in the evening. I am lucky to live here.\n\nWe have duplex homes on our street. Each one looks the same from the outside. But the inside is different. Some are small. I like to walk in the big field behind my house. I see deer and hear a bullfrog singing in the morning. It is a great place to live. We have a pond that is not for swimming. I like it here, 40 minutes from the city.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood one year before I started eighth grade. It was hard to make friends at first, but I made two friends who lived near me. One lives two houses down, and the other lives on my street. They do not live there anymore, but I still have happy memories. The people who lived here when I first moved here are still here. My neighborhood is like many American neighborhoods. It has two-story houses and a park. I like this about my neighborhood.\n\nEvery weekend, I hear kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days. I have never had a problem with anyone in my neighborhood. They leave you alone unless you need help. I have ordered many packages online and they have never been stolen from my porch.\n\nThe park is near my house. I have happy memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with my friends. But I also got hurt playing football. The good memories are more important. When I go to the park now, I spend time with my little cousin's kids. They like playing on swings and slides. The park makes me feel happy and sad at the same time.\n\nMy neighborhood is diverse. You can find many kinds of food nearby. There are Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants within a short distance. Many people use apps to get food delivered. There are also fast food shops and pizza places. The stores near my house have everything we need. There are dry cleaners, a pharmacy, and a grocery store. There are even stores that sell Indian food. I like my neighborhood.\n\nWhen I read about problems with neighbors on social media, I feel happy to have the friends and neighborhood I have.",
            "I live in a small town in South Carolina. It is not a big town, but it is important for farming. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World. This is what the welcome sign says. The town is mostly farmland with many peach trees and cattle. The houses are far apart and two stories high. They have metal or gray roofs to keep out the hot sun. Most houses are not near the road. They are far back so people can use the front land for animals and crops.\n\nIn the main part of town, there is one traffic light. This is where you will find the town's stores. There are three places to get fast food. One is Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant. Another is Fiesta Mexican Restaurant. The third is Gary's, a small burger place. There used to be a pizzeria, but it is closed now.\n\nThere is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. People like to buy Cherry Coca-Cola there. There is one grocery store called IGA. It is not very big, so people often go to a bigger store in another town. The most popular store is Dollar General. It sells many things and is very busy. There is a furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. They deliver the furniture you buy. Next to the store is a place to take care of your pet called Clark's Cuts and Kennels.\n\nThe doctor and the vet are in separate buildings outside the main part of town. They are small, but they can help the people of Johnston. There is one school called Johnston Elementary School. When students finish fifth grade, they go to school in the next town. We are making a new park with a playground and other fun things. But right now, there is not much to do in our town. We do not have a movie theater, bowling alley, or many restaurants. But it is a nice town. You can easily miss it if you are driving by!",
            "I first heard about my town on a podcast. It was about people who were missing. I was surprised. Almost every apartment in my area is expensive. It costs over one thousand dollars a month. I had not heard about this story before. My friends did not know about it either. Maybe it is hard for people to hear. I know some of my friends cry at night. Life is expensive, but we have learned to save money. We like second-hand things. We like the smell of old toys and old clothes. When you grow up, you smell less. As an adult, you might smoke or you might just be used to things being this way. But the flea market is always there. The smell of old magazines on a piano is strong. It stays in the leather even after you wash it.\n\nThere are three second-hand stores near my home. If you start on one side, you can visit two charity stores, a library, and a store with old books. Downtown is busy. Cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you cannot hear it in the thrift stores. No matter how many people or cars go by, the stores are quiet. It is a nice place to spend the afternoon. Every year, more and more people come to downtown. It is a growing city. One of the biggest companies for online shopping and delivery is here. It is still getting bigger. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is busy with their own goals. No one asks you for help. You can be alone and people will leave you alone. It is different from the South. In the South, people care about each other. They ask questions. You can keep to yourself in this city and it will not matter. It is a lively place to be. There is music from the man who plays the piano next door and the two singers upstairs. There is always something going on. We have less of an apartment of strangers and more of a community of friends. We help each other when we need it. We celebrate birthdays and help each other when someone dies. I am lucky to live here. I like most of my neighbors. They treat me well. I try to clean up after myself and I leave food for them. They do the same for me. It is nice to see them and I think they like my company as much as I like theirs. I live in a big, modern city, but it is my neighbors who make me feel good about my life.",
            "I live in a typical suburban area. My neighborhood is very nice. It looks very well taken care of. The houses are all single family homes. The homeowner's association helps keep everything nice. The front yards are all the same. They have small lawns, some small rocks, and short driveways. Some houses have two cars. As you drive around the neighborhood, you see new concrete roads. The roads are good. There are no potholes. Most houses are one story, but some are two stories. We don't have mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, there are many boxes at the end of the street. You need a key to get your mail. There are two big boxes for packages.\n\nMy house is at the edge of the city. It's a mix of country and suburbs. We have a lot of space. There are many pools that everyone can use. They are well kept and locked. There are paths where you can walk your dog or take a walk. You don't need to go to a park to get exercise. The neighborhood is big, so you can run around it and get exercise. Many people who live here are retired. It's a safe area and people look out for each other. We also have some young and middle-aged people. The city is big in population, but it has a small town feel. We have many things you need, like a mall. It's not very big, but it's enough. I can drive 15 minutes and find many stores. There are high-end stores with organic food and stores with low prices and few employees. My neighborhood is safe, clean, and nice. We have many good things, like pools and walking paths. If we need to go shopping, we can drive to a big store.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest. It is near a big city. My neighborhood is on the east side of the town. Many people who live here have low incomes. The houses are not expensive. My neighbors are friendly. They say hello when I walk down the street. There is some crime in the area. A few people have been hurt in shootings. Our next-door neighbors' son was killed in a shooting last year. We have not been hurt by crime. Sometimes we lose small things from our porch.\n\nThe town is having problems with a sickness from a drug called fentanyl. Many people have died from it. But there are places to help people with addiction. My son goes to a good school. He has extra help because he needs it. He has friends and teachers who care about him. He loves his school. The school gives free food to all students. No one is treated differently because they do not have enough money.\n\nThe town is improving. They have fixed some roads and parks. But most of the changes are on the west side of town. My neighborhood is not as nice as some other parts of town. We like living here. People are friendly, the schools are good, and there are many stores to buy things. Our home is not worth a lot of money, but it is comfortable.\n\nWe have lived here for over 16 years. We do not want to live anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It is on a hill. Many old buildings are there. I live in a seven-story apartment building near an old theater. Across the street is a fun bar that people like to visit on warm summer nights. People wait in line to get in on weekends during June and July.\n\nNearby is a big park. It is nice for the area. The park has concrete around it and wide stairs. During cold winter months, homeless people set up tents. It is warmer for them to be close together.\n\nI like my city's culture. It is not just about old buildings. The people are special. My neighborhood used to be bad because of gang violence. But the people work hard to keep it clean. They care about their city.\n\nSome people say if you are white, do not walk around at night. I think this is a reminder of the past. I am not white. I think the people like me because I understand their problems. They are kind to me. They help me.\n\nI feel good walking at night. People are nice. A laundromat owner let me charge my phone when I had no place to go. Someone gave me money and told me I am beautiful. The people here are special. I feel alive here.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan. It is a peaceful place. The town is near two big lakes, Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. I like living here. It is a safe place. I can walk to many places. There is a park not far from my house. My neighborhood is quiet. Houses are not close together. They are old homes that have been updated. Many houses have yards with trampolines and playsets. People take care of their lawns. The grass is cut and the plants are trimmed.\n\nIt is a good place to raise a family. You can see children playing outside. People know each other in this town. They say hello when they see each other. The town has a sheriff's department and a health department. There is a recycling center where people take their trash. We also have baseball and softball fields. You can hear the announcers calling the games. There is a small airport near my house. I can hear the planes taking off and landing.\n\nI like my neighborhood. It is not perfect, but it is a good place to live. It is safe and peaceful. My kids can ride their bikes to the park. It is only a few blocks away. I can walk to get ice cream from a local shop. It is a great place to live."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "I live in a big city. My neighborhood is very different. Residential areas and businesses are near each other. Some areas are for offices, stores, restaurants, and entertainment. There are many new restaurants and stores to eat and shop at. Some stores are big and well-known, but small stores are also popular. They are in malls and on the streets. People walk to these stores. There are parks near my neighborhood. I see people with their young children in these parks.\n\nMy neighborhood is very diverse. There are many kinds of people. One area has a community of LGBTQ+ people, Orthodox Jews, and people from the former Soviet Union. Outside my neighborhood, there are many more people of different races and backgrounds. They have their own communities in the city. We have Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia, which are a short drive away. But traffic in my city is very bad. It takes a long time to drive a short distance, especially during rush hour. Almost no one walks in my city. We have a lot of traffic and hard-to-find parking spots.\n\nThe city is getting bigger. New apartment buildings are being built. Many people are moving to the city. Some residents do not want more people and traffic. There are many kinds of houses in my city. Not everyone lives in big apartment buildings. We have houses of different sizes and smaller buildings. Some homes are for one family, and others are for two families. My neighborhood is also made up of people of different ages. I do not know most of my neighbors. My neighborhood is not close like it used to be. I have good memories of playing with my friends when I was a child.",
            "My neighborhood is very interesting. Most houses are for one family. But some houses have been split into two. They are still connected. My home has a small front yard and a small driveway to the side. My neighborhood looks like it did a long time ago. People wanted to live in the suburbs then. It seemed like a good life. But now it is not the same. Many people still live here. They still like it. The people are not as happy as they used to be. The yards are not as nice as they used to be. But there are still cars in the driveways. The kids still play. They think the world is their whole world. A public school has been here for almost 90 years. It still stands. It makes the young people think about the future. It makes the older people remember the past. There are few churches. They are not very full. The basketball courts are always full. All the houses are different. But they feel the same. There is a big store called \"A\". It is owned by a big Yemeni family. They may be the only Arab family in the neighborhood. Most of the people are African American. The streets are wide. The kids usually play football. They stop to let cars pass. Most people have lived here for many years. They can tell stories about when everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school. But now it is a pharmacy. Kids do not want to be like Daniel-san anymore. There is a small movie theater. It shows old movies at a lower price. The young people do not like it. They think it is old-fashioned. The older people like it. They think it is a good way to spend the night out. There is one highway that goes through our town. The entrance and exit are in the next town. People wanted to put an entrance and exit in our town. But the older people said no. They said it would make our town less nice. The city agreed with them. They are building a new school. We are choosing a symbol for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be a good symbol for my town.",
            "You might not see it at first. This is a residential area behind a shopping strip. People do not usually live here. At least, not many people want to live here. But if you go behind the old shopping center and walk to the back, you will find a community. There are many apartment buildings here. They are close together like a line of boxes.\n\nThe first group of apartments has bad news. We will not talk about it much. It looks bad, but it is not all bad. The other apartment buildings are nice. Many people live here. Across from these buildings is a college. It is a small group of buildings. Students go there to learn. They are quiet and sleepy in the morning. They drink coffee and go to class.\n\nThe road goes through this area. It meets another road. On one side is a park. Children play here. They run around and play games. On the other side is a place to help people with broken bones. The porch is nice and there is a fan to cool the air.\n\nMany people live in this area. They walk their dogs and go to the park. Some teenagers ride skateboards and talk to their friends. There is a place to buy food, a store for swimming pools, and a place for people to get manicures. You can buy food, fill your pool, and get a manicure all at the same time. There is also a place to buy frozen yogurt. Many teenagers like to eat frozen yogurt and ride their skateboards.\n\nThis is a special place. It is a part of American history. Nothing much changes here. Time goes slowly.",
            "We drove through a big area with many corn fields. \"What is this place?\" she asked. \"This is it,\" I said. She was from a city where a store was just a short walk from her house. She had never seen so much open space before. I told her about where I grew up in rural Ohio. She understood who I was and where I came from.\n\nWe drove down a small road. We passed a big hole in the ground with water in it. My home was just beyond that. My neighborhood has houses made of brick and stucco. Each house has a big piece of land. People take care of their land and are very proud of it. In the spring, we plant flowers and trees. The trees change color with the seasons. The driveways have nice cars, like Mercedes. They shine in the sun after a car wash.\n\nMy neighbor was outside. He was a doctor in his younger years. Now he is older and has a lawn mower. He mows his lawn all day and sings while he works. Everyone likes him. He is a kind person with a special story.\n\nWe finally arrived at my home. There are geese in the yard. Our dog chases them. Behind my house, there is a small stream that flows into the hole in the ground. You can hear frogs, water, and animals from the farms nearby. There is a bridge made of wood over the stream. On the other side, there are trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This is where I spent most of my childhood. I built forts and played with my friends. We had snow in the winter. The trees were bare and looked like skeletons. Sometimes it snowed and our yard looked like a winter wonderland. My sister and I would make snowmen and snow angels. We would fight and use snowballs as our weapons. We built forts and had fun in the snow.",
            "Portland, Oregon is a special place. Some say it is \"weird\". This is shown by the town slogan, \"Keep Portland Weird\". It is written on a building that has a pizza joint, a bar, a music place, and a place where people dance. People like this slogan. To some, it means keep the old Portland alive. This is the Portland from the 1990s and early 2000s. It was not as famous and not as expensive. It made new and creative cultures. To others, it means come to Portland, where people like being different.\n\nMany rich people from California have moved to Portland. New houses are being built. But Portland is still weird. Weird means accepting things that others do not accept. But it does not mean Portland does not have new things. We buy things from China like other parts of the country. There are many ways to be weird. But Portland also has normal things. We have yoga, hipsters, and business people. Maybe being weird means not taking things too seriously.\n\nI live in a neighborhood with colorful houses, gardens, and boxes. Boxes are free things people give away. They can be used boxes or plastic bags. Inside the boxes, you can find nice things, like clothes and books. You can find anything. This is what Portland is all about. Or at least, it is what Portland is all about to me. There are many kinds of weird people in Portland. Some people will never pick up things from a box. They will go to goat yoga or watch the soccer team, the Timbers.\n\nPortland is full of people who love many things. We have people who chase our dreams, or think about chasing our dreams while we drink too much at the bar. Portland has problems. We have a drug problem. It usually comes from mental health problems. The rain and clouds can make people feel sad. We also have a homelessness problem. Many people come here because we have good services. But our services are not enough. People who have homes are sometimes kind, sometimes angry. This is the same in other parts of the country. We are not weird in feeling this way.",
            "There are mountains in the north. They watch the sun every day. They see the sun come up and go down. They are always there. I forget about them sometimes. Work and life take my attention. But they are still there. They are strong and steady. They do not change. When I am very stressed, I think about them. They remind me to take a deep breath and to be strong. I moved here when I started college. The mountains near my school were beautiful. I loved them at first. The school has nice buildings and a pond. But the mountains are special to me. The town is nice too. There are many coffee shops where I studied. I can walk or take a bus to the downtown area. It is old and interesting. There are old buildings and restaurants. It is busy and exciting. But it is not busy for long. I can go back to a quiet part of town. The library is there. It is a place to rest. I like this town because it is different in different parts. It is a nice place to live. I have good memories here. I walked with friends in the park. We went to the movies in a nice theater. But I also have sad memories. We all have sad memories. The ponds are a good place to think and cry. I went to the pond at night and wondered about my life. I looked at the animals and thought about my purpose. I walked to the main street and saw the sun. The sun was shining and made the sky beautiful. I looked at the mountains and I felt strong. They reminded me to be strong and to keep going.",
            "If you plan to visit Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, you will have no trouble finding it. The city has good public transportation. Bensonhurst is a busy neighborhood like the rest of New York City. You will see many Asian stores as you walk. Many Asian people live in Bensonhurst. This is why you will find an Asian store on almost every block. Supermarkets and laundromats are popular. People like these stores because food is good, prices are low, and they are easy to use.\n\nNear my home, there are four Asian supermarkets within a short walk. This is helpful for buying groceries. Bensonhurst is a mixed area. Many immigrants and their children live here. Some big businesses in the area are owned by Asian people. There is also a park nearby. The park has many basketball courts, a big field for soccer or baseball, handball courts, a playground for children, and a water fountain for kids to play in during the summer.\n\nThe area has many small homes and co-op buildings. Few big buildings are here. Many people are friendly, but some can be noisy. Cars often play music loudly as they drive by. You may hear a car starting quickly in the morning. At night, be careful. Some people can be mean. You may meet people who want to cause trouble. I was once bullied here. But that was a long time ago. Recently, someone took a package from my home. This is a common problem in Bensonhurst. People do not clean up after their dogs. Every day, you will see dog waste on the street. This is my biggest problem.",
            "I live in a place with few sidewalks. People have to walk on the road because there are no sidewalks. The road can be a little bit bad to drive on because it has holes in some places. There are many telephone and electric wires above the road. They look bad because they get broken in storms and need to be fixed many times.\n\nMy house is at the top of the biggest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work-out hill\" because many runners like to run up the hill. The houses are built high up so people can see the ocean.\n\nThere are many tall trees around my house. People do not like the trees because they block the view of the ocean. But the trees are nice when the sun sets. The water looks nice and the sky turns orange.\n\nIt often rains and storms in our area. Moss grows on everything, including houses, cars and railings. One time I left my car outside for a month and it got covered in moss. It took me three hours to clean it off.\n\nThere are not many children in my neighborhood. The people are mostly older and many are retired. They have dogs instead of children. The dogs are always running around and sometimes they get into people's houses.\n\nWe have many wild rabbits. They dig up gardens and burrow into lawns. My cats like to catch them and there are not many rabbits left in our neighborhood.\n\nWe see many birds, like small birds and hummingbirds. Sometimes a hawk or eagle comes by, but the crows chase it away.\n\nThere are no stores in my neighborhood. But if you walk down to the waterfront, you can find some restaurants that serve fresh seafood. The beach is not very big, but it is fun to throw rocks into the water.",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. My house is on a street between two main roads. This means we have some traffic, but it is a quiet neighborhood. People do not move in and out often. I know most of my neighbors. They work in their yards and do other daily things. In the winter, we sled down a small hill. We live at the corner of the street. We see all the people who come and go. We take note of strangers' cars. Some neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Children ride their bikes. We work from home. There are four of us: my wife, our two daughters, and me. We are at home a lot. We go outside and play, even in the rain. We sometimes grill on our back deck. It smells good. We hear lawn mowers almost every day from March to October. It is a wooded area, so we have trees and shade. We rake and burn leaves in the fall. I like the smell of burning leaves. It means fall is here. We do not have much winter. It feels like a long fall. My garage is at the back of the house. I like to work on my truck in the garage. When the doors are open, I feel close to my neighbors. On holidays, it is quiet. We have visitors on Thanksgiving and other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. I like living here. If the street were not a main road, it would be perfect.",
            "I live in a neighborhood in the middle of a dry and sandy area. This area is very different from many other places. When you look around, you see mostly brown and dirt. It is not very green like some other places. Sometimes I see a small green area, like a lawn. But this is very expensive to take care of. When I first moved here, there were many houses far apart. Now there are more houses, and it looks like a small city.\n\nPeople in my neighborhood are generally friendly. But, like any place, it has good and bad parts. Many old people live in my neighborhood, and it is a nice place. There are some stores, but not many. Most of the stores are part of big chains, like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want to buy healthy food, you have to go somewhere else. My city is not very developed, and there are many open spaces. This is why many people work in construction. I work in construction, too. I install drywall and T-bars for a living.\n\nI like my neighborhood because of the animals. People come to our area to see the beauty of the desert. The desert has a special climate and geography that supports many different kinds of wildlife. People who live here should learn about the animals that live here so we can live together safely. My family loves animals, and we have learned a lot about them. We even try to catch them when we can. If you come to visit, there are some things to see. Victorville is a good place for families to learn about the desert. You can visit the San Bernardino County Fair, which is a fun event. You can also visit Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and learn winter sports. If you are interested in the natural history and culture of the desert, you can visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has many interesting things to see, like rocks, old bones, and Native American artifacts.",
            "My neighborhood is the college campus where I live. I live in a dormitory with many people from different countries and ages. My neighborhood also includes the campus area around my dorm. I like my neighborhood. It has many things like homes, people, stores, and a park.\n\nLet's talk about the homes in my neighborhood. There are three kinds of homes. Some are apartments, some are houses, and some are dorm rooms. Apartments have 2-4 people in each room. There are 4-6 rooms on each floor. Some buildings are 2 floors high. So, about 20 people live in each building. Some houses are for rent. They have 2-4 bedrooms. Only a few people live in these houses. Most students live in dorm rooms. Two people share a room, sometimes.\n\nMy college is proud of its diversity. People from many countries and ages live in my neighborhood. Some staff members live in houses. New students live in dorms and older students live in apartments. Let's talk about the stores and park. My school is a closed neighborhood. It has many stores and one park. The stores have food, clothes, and things we need. We can buy anything we need in our neighborhood. The park is a fun place for everyone. It is clean and safe because all neighbors take care of it.",
            "I have lived in this neighborhood for 10 years. I am happy to share what I know about it. When I first came here, I was sad. I missed my friends and family from Riverdale. My mom and dad wanted the best for me and my sister, so we moved to Stockbridge. Our new neighborhood was better. It had good housing and a good high school. I made new friends and enemies in school. I did not get to know my neighbors very well, but I liked Mr. Glen and his children. They are kind people. I remember their wedding. My family and I attended. We had a good time. I even caught a white strap that Mrs. Glen took off her leg. I did not catch the flowers, though. I like to visit the park and walk in nature. It makes me feel calm. I also like to practice my balance with sticks. I have a wooden sword that I like to play with. There is a basketball and tennis court. I used to play tennis with my dad and Mr. Graves. We had fun, but we worked hard. I hope I can play again. I have had some happy times in this neighborhood. I think there is more to come.",
            "I live near the college I attend. It is very convenient for me. Many apartment buildings are in my area. Some are old, but they have been renovated inside. There are also some restaurants and bars. They are fun to go to and not very expensive. One bar changed its name recently. It is a bit more expensive, but the service and drinks are good.\n\nMost people in my area are students or have low incomes. They live in apartments because they are not very expensive. There is an elementary school near my home. Many children live in the area. My neighbors are not very friendly. They smoke a lot. I do not want to know them.\n\nMy apartment building is old, but it has a lot of trees around it. Some trees were cut down, but there are still many trees. The street behind my building has another set of apartments. The street next to mine is not as nice. The sidewalks are bad, and the buildings look old. There are many trees on that street to hide the bad buildings. Much crime happens on that street. But crime happens in other places too.\n\nI like where I live. I can afford it. There are many good things near my home. The college is close, and I can easily ride a bus to go shopping or downtown.",
            "My neighborhood has duplex homes on a circle street. They look like individual houses. Each one is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone is friends with each other. We stand at the end of our driveways sometimes and talk while our children play outside. It is nice to be in a place without many cars and computers. It is like going back in time.\n\nWe are surrounded by fields, trees, and blue skies with white clouds. But we also have problems. This season, we have had tornado warnings. Last night, we heard the tornado sirens. We went to our shelter. I was in my bathtub with my small dog and a few things. My big dog stayed in the living room. It was quiet outside except for the sound of hail on the ground.\n\nAfter the storm, the road was hot. We had a big change in temperature. The hail melted on the hot pavement. The sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow happened. I took pictures with my camera. My friends were impressed. The neighborhood stayed quiet for a little while. Then people came home from wherever they were.\n\nWe have a good community. We are close to the city of Charlotte. Every morning, we hear roosters crowing from the nearby farms. It is like living in a small village. We even have a donkey that brays in the evening. I am lucky to live here.\n\nWe have duplex homes on our street. Each one looks the same from the outside. But the inside is different. Some are small. I like to walk in the big field behind my house. I see deer and hear a bullfrog singing in the morning. It is a great place to live. We have a pond that is not for swimming. I like it here, 40 minutes from the city.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood one year before I started eighth grade. It was hard to make friends at first, but I made two friends who lived near me. One lives two houses down, and the other lives on my street. They do not live there anymore, but I still have happy memories. The people who lived here when I first moved here are still here. My neighborhood is like many American neighborhoods. It has two-story houses and a park. I like this about my neighborhood.\n\nEvery weekend, I hear kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days. I have never had a problem with anyone in my neighborhood. They leave you alone unless you need help. I have ordered many packages online and they have never been stolen from my porch.\n\nThe park is near my house. I have happy memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with my friends. But I also got hurt playing football. The good memories are more important. When I go to the park now, I spend time with my little cousin's kids. They like playing on swings and slides. The park makes me feel happy and sad at the same time.\n\nMy neighborhood is diverse. You can find many kinds of food nearby. There are Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants within a short distance. Many people use apps to get food delivered. There are also fast food shops and pizza places. The stores near my house have everything we need. There are dry cleaners, a pharmacy, and a grocery store. There are even stores that sell Indian food. I like my neighborhood.\n\nWhen I read about problems with neighbors on social media, I feel happy to have the friends and neighborhood I have.",
            "I live in a small town in South Carolina. It is not a big town, but it is important for farming. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World. This is what the welcome sign says. The town is mostly farmland with many peach trees and cattle. The houses are far apart and two stories high. They have metal or gray roofs to keep out the hot sun. Most houses are not near the road. They are far back so people can use the front land for animals and crops.\n\nIn the main part of town, there is one traffic light. This is where you will find the town's stores. There are three places to get fast food. One is Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant. Another is Fiesta Mexican Restaurant. The third is Gary's, a small burger place. There used to be a pizzeria, but it is closed now.\n\nThere is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. People like to buy Cherry Coca-Cola there. There is one grocery store called IGA. It is not very big, so people often go to a bigger store in another town. The most popular store is Dollar General. It sells many things and is very busy. There is a furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. They deliver the furniture you buy. Next to the store is a place to take care of your pet called Clark's Cuts and Kennels.\n\nThe doctor and the vet are in separate buildings outside the main part of town. They are small, but they can help the people of Johnston. There is one school called Johnston Elementary School. When students finish fifth grade, they go to school in the next town. We are making a new park with a playground and other fun things. But right now, there is not much to do in our town. We do not have a movie theater, bowling alley, or many restaurants. But it is a nice town. You can easily miss it if you are driving by!",
            "I first heard about my town on a podcast. It was about people who were missing. I was surprised. Almost every apartment in my area is expensive. It costs over one thousand dollars a month. I had not heard about this story before. My friends did not know about it either. Maybe it is hard for people to hear. I know some of my friends cry at night. Life is expensive, but we have learned to save money. We like second-hand things. We like the smell of old toys and old clothes. When you grow up, you smell less. As an adult, you might smoke or you might just be used to things being this way. But the flea market is always there. The smell of old magazines on a piano is strong. It stays in the leather even after you wash it.\n\nThere are three second-hand stores near my home. If you start on one side, you can visit two charity stores, a library, and a store with old books. Downtown is busy. Cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you cannot hear it in the thrift stores. No matter how many people or cars go by, the stores are quiet. It is a nice place to spend the afternoon. Every year, more and more people come to downtown. It is a growing city. One of the biggest companies for online shopping and delivery is here. It is still getting bigger. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is busy with their own goals. No one asks you for help. You can be alone and people will leave you alone. It is different from the South. In the South, people care about each other. They ask questions. You can keep to yourself in this city and it will not matter. It is a lively place to be. There is music from the man who plays the piano next door and the two singers upstairs. There is always something going on. We have less of an apartment of strangers and more of a community of friends. We help each other when we need it. We celebrate birthdays and help each other when someone dies. I am lucky to live here. I like most of my neighbors. They treat me well. I try to clean up after myself and I leave food for them. They do the same for me. It is nice to see them and I think they like my company as much as I like theirs. I live in a big, modern city, but it is my neighbors who make me feel good about my life.",
            "I live in a typical suburban area. My neighborhood is very nice. It looks very well taken care of. The houses are all single family homes. The homeowner's association helps keep everything nice. The front yards are all the same. They have small lawns, some small rocks, and short driveways. Some houses have two cars. As you drive around the neighborhood, you see new concrete roads. The roads are good. There are no potholes. Most houses are one story, but some are two stories. We don't have mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, there are many boxes at the end of the street. You need a key to get your mail. There are two big boxes for packages.\n\nMy house is at the edge of the city. It's a mix of country and suburbs. We have a lot of space. There are many pools that everyone can use. They are well kept and locked. There are paths where you can walk your dog or take a walk. You don't need to go to a park to get exercise. The neighborhood is big, so you can run around it and get exercise. Many people who live here are retired. It's a safe area and people look out for each other. We also have some young and middle-aged people. The city is big in population, but it has a small town feel. We have many things you need, like a mall. It's not very big, but it's enough. I can drive 15 minutes and find many stores. There are high-end stores with organic food and stores with low prices and few employees. My neighborhood is safe, clean, and nice. We have many good things, like pools and walking paths. If we need to go shopping, we can drive to a big store.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest. It is near a big city. My neighborhood is on the east side of the town. Many people who live here have low incomes. The houses are not expensive. My neighbors are friendly. They say hello when I walk down the street. There is some crime in the area. A few people have been hurt in shootings. Our next-door neighbors' son was killed in a shooting last year. We have not been hurt by crime. Sometimes we lose small things from our porch.\n\nThe town is having problems with a sickness from a drug called fentanyl. Many people have died from it. But there are places to help people with addiction. My son goes to a good school. He has extra help because he needs it. He has friends and teachers who care about him. He loves his school. The school gives free food to all students. No one is treated differently because they do not have enough money.\n\nThe town is improving. They have fixed some roads and parks. But most of the changes are on the west side of town. My neighborhood is not as nice as some other parts of town. We like living here. People are friendly, the schools are good, and there are many stores to buy things. Our home is not worth a lot of money, but it is comfortable.\n\nWe have lived here for over 16 years. We do not want to live anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It is on a hill. Many old buildings are there. I live in a seven-story apartment building near an old theater. Across the street is a fun bar that people like to visit on warm summer nights. People wait in line to get in on weekends during June and July.\n\nNearby is a big park. It is nice for the area. The park has concrete around it and wide stairs. During cold winter months, homeless people set up tents. It is warmer for them to be close together.\n\nI like my city's culture. It is not just about old buildings. The people are special. My neighborhood used to be bad because of gang violence. But the people work hard to keep it clean. They care about their city.\n\nSome people say if you are white, do not walk around at night. I think this is a reminder of the past. I am not white. I think the people like me because I understand their problems. They are kind to me. They help me.\n\nI feel good walking at night. People are nice. A laundromat owner let me charge my phone when I had no place to go. Someone gave me money and told me I am beautiful. The people here are special. I feel alive here.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan. It is a peaceful place. The town is near two big lakes, Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. I like living here. It is a safe place. I can walk to many places. There is a park not far from my house. My neighborhood is quiet. Houses are not close together. They are old homes that have been updated. Many houses have yards with trampolines and playsets. People take care of their lawns. The grass is cut and the plants are trimmed.\n\nIt is a good place to raise a family. You can see children playing outside. People know each other in this town. They say hello when they see each other. The town has a sheriff's department and a health department. There is a recycling center where people take their trash. We also have baseball and softball fields. You can hear the announcers calling the games. There is a small airport near my house. I can hear the planes taking off and landing.\n\nI like my neighborhood. It is not perfect, but it is a good place to live. It is safe and peaceful. My kids can ride their bikes to the park. It is only a few blocks away. I can walk to get ice cream from a local shop. It is a great place to live."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "I live in a big city. My neighborhood is very diverse. Many different kinds of buildings are here. Homes and offices are near stores and restaurants. There are many places to eat and shop. Some stores are big and well-known. Others are small and unique. They are in malls or on streets. These streets are near quiet neighborhoods. But they are not quiet because of the many interesting places.\n\nThere are parks near my home. Many people visit these parks with their young children. My neighborhood has many different kinds of people. There is a big LGBTQ+ community. There are also Orthodox Jews and people from the former Soviet Union. Many other people from different countries live in the city. Some live in areas like Korea Town, China Town, and Little Armenia.\n\nBut getting around the city is difficult. It takes a long time to drive just a few miles. This is because of traffic. Most people do not walk in the city. We have a lot of cars, and it is hard to find places to park. The city is building more buildings. This means more people will come and drive. Some people do not like this.\n\nThere are many kinds of homes in the city. Not everyone lives in big buildings. Some people live in houses or small apartments. My neighborhood is the same. There are many different kinds of homes. People of all ages live here. I do not know most of my neighbors. But I have good memories of playing with friends when I was a child.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. It has single-family homes. Some homes are attached, but still separate. My home has a small yard and a small driveway. Most homes look like they did many years ago. That was when living in the suburbs was the American dream. Many people still like our neighborhood. They like the homes and the way it looks. But people are not as happy as they used to be. The yards are not kept up well. But there are still cars in every driveway. Children play outside as if the world is all they have. We have a school that has been here for almost 90 years. It still looks good and makes young people think about the future. Older people remember the good old days when they were young. We have a few churches, but they are not used much. The basketball courts are still busy. All the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a big store called Super A. It is owned by a Yemeni family. They are probably the only Arab family in our neighborhood. Most people in our neighborhood are African American. Our streets are wide and children play football. Most people have lived here for a long time. They can tell stories of when everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school, but it closed. Now it is a pharmacy. People think medicine makes everything better. We have a small movie theater that shows old movies at a low price. Young people do not like it because it does not have new movies. Older people like it because it is cheap and a good way to go out. We have a highway that goes through our town. But the entrance and exit are in the next town. Some people wanted a highway exit in our town, but others did not. They said it would hurt our town. The town council agreed with them. We are getting a new high school. We are trying to decide on a name for it. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be a good name for our town.",
            "You might not notice it at first. It is a residential area behind a shopping strip. Not a place people usually want to live. But if you walk behind the old, abandoned store, you will find a community. \n\nThe community has apartment buildings. They are next to each other. These buildings are like connected houses. The first apartments you see have been in the news for bad things. We will not talk about them too much. But the other buildings are a different story. Almost no one knows about this part of the community.\n\nAcross from these buildings is a school. It is a small college. Students go there to learn. They arrive in the morning with coffee and yawn. The gates open slowly. Commuters get angry because the students cause traffic.\n\nA road meets another road here. On one side is a park. On the other side is a place to help people with broken bones. The center has comfortable chairs and a fan that moves the air. Children play in the park. They run and play with their friends. Old people walk their dogs and look at the teenagers on their skateboards.\n\nThere is a store with cheap food. There is a store for swimming pools. There is a place for people to get their nails done. You can fill your pool while getting food and a manicure. There is a store for frozen yogurt. Teenagers eat cold yogurt and do tricks on their skateboards.\n\nThis neighborhood is a part of America. It is a place with a lot of history. Not much changes here. Time seems to go slowly.",
            "She looked out the window and asked, \"Where are we?\" The fields of corn stretched far out. \"This is it,\" I said. She looked surprised. She was from a town where the grocery store was close to her house. She had never seen so much open space. I told her what it was like to grow up in a small town in Ohio. She finally understood who I was.\n\nWe drove down a country road. There was a big hole in the ground filled with water. Just past it was my neighborhood. The houses were made of brick and stucco. Each house had a lot of land. People take care of their land. In the spring, flowers and trees are beautiful. The driveways have expensive cars. My Korean neighbor is always outside. He mows his lawn and sings. Everyone likes him. He is a kind person. He used to be a doctor. Now he is older and sometimes forgetful.\n\nAs we drove, you will see my house. There are geese in the yard. Our dog chases them. Behind my house is a stream. You can hear the water, frogs, and sometimes cows from the farms. A bridge made of wood leads to a special place. There are trees, herbs, and flowers that grow naturally. This is where I spent most of my childhood. I built forts and played with my friends.\n\nIn the winter, it can be very cold. But it is also beautiful. The trees look bare and the yard is empty. Sometimes it snows and the yard looks like a winter wonderland. My little sister and I would make snow angels and snowmen. We would fight and use snowballs as weapons. We built forts made of branches. We would play pretend and forget about everything else.",
            "Portland is a city in Oregon. It is famous for being weird. The city's unofficial slogan is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" This means the city is different from other places. Some people think this is good. They see it as a fun and creative place. Others think it is a call to come and visit. They will not be judged for being different. \n\nThe city has changed. Many rich people from California have moved here. They have built new homes. Some people are not happy about this change. But Portland is still a weird place. It accepts things that other places do not. The city has modern things like everyone else. People buy things from China. In Portland, you can find many different kinds of people. There are business people, artists, and people who like yoga. The city has colorful houses and gardens. There are free boxes on the street. These boxes have things that people are getting rid of. You never know what you might find. It is like a treasure hunt.\n\nNot everyone likes Portland. Some people do not want to take things from the street. They go to special events like goat yoga. This is a kind of yoga with real goats. Others go to soccer games. Portland has a problem with drugs. This is because of mental health problems. The weather in Portland is also a problem. It is often rainy and gray. The city also has a problem with people who do not have a home. The city has good services for these people, but they are not enough. Some people in the city do not know what to do with this problem. They are happy with the city's weirdness, but not with its problems.",
            "The mountains are always there. They stand in the north, watching the sun rise and set every day. They do not change. They are strong and calm. They do not change even when I am busy with my life and work.\n\nWhen I am very stressed, the mountains remind me to stop and rest. They give me strength to go on. I moved here when I started college. The mountains north of campus were beautiful and caught my attention. The university has many nice buildings, ponds, and trees. But the mountains are special. The rest of the town is nice too. There are many cafes where I studied and drank coffee. I can walk or take the bus to the downtown area. The buildings there are old and pleasant. They make me feel calm. But the mountains have a strong presence. The town is a mix of calm and busy places. It is like a small town and a big city combined. I can walk to the library to find peace. The library is quiet and calm.\n\nI have happy and sad memories in this town. I walked with friends in the park and went to the movie theater. The ponds are a good place to think and cry. I have had my share of crying there. I like to watch the animals living by the pond. They remind me of my own life and purpose. I walked past the pond and park to the main street. The sun was shining and I saw the mountains. They were as strong and calm as always. They reminded me to keep going.",
            "If you visit Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you will have no problem finding it. Public transportation is easy to use. Many people in New York City use it. Bensonhurst is a busy neighborhood. You will feel like you are in New York City. There are many Asian stores in the area. This is because many Asians live there. You will see an Asian store on almost every block. The stores sell food and do laundry. People like these stores because the food is good, prices are low, and it is easy to go there. \n\nThere are four Asian stores near me. You can walk to them in two minutes. This makes it easy to buy food. Bensonhurst is not only Asian. Many different kinds of people live there. They are from many countries. Many Asian people own businesses in the neighborhood. There is a nice park near me. It has basketball courts, a big field for soccer or baseball, and a playground for kids. This park is fun for everyone. \n\nThe neighborhood is not very tall. There are no big buildings. Most people live in small houses or apartments. The people are nice, but they can be noisy. You will hear cars playing loud music as they drive by. People also drive fast, which can wake you up. If you visit at night, be careful. This neighborhood is safe, but some people can cause trouble. I have had problems in the past, but that was a long time ago. There are also thieves who take packages. People do not clean up after their dogs. You will see dog waste on the street every day. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!",
            "I do not like my sidewalk. Where I live, everything goes downhill. My house is at the top of a big hill. People call it the \"exercise hill\" because runners like to run up it. There is no sidewalk on my street. Everyone walks on the road. The road has many holes and is not safe to drive on. There are many wires above the road. They look old and broken. It rains a lot in my area. The wind breaks the wires and causes trouble. There are many big trees everywhere. But people do not like the trees. They want to cut them down because they block the ocean view. That is why houses are built high on the hill. They have big windows to see the ocean. It is beautiful at sunset. The water shines and the sky turns orange. But it is often cloudy and damp. Moss grows on everything. It even grows on my car. I left my car outside for a month. When I went to use it, it was green and covered in moss. I had to clean it for a long time. There are not many children in my area. There is a school nearby, but most people are old and retired. They have dogs instead of kids. I see dogs in people's yards or running in the street. If you do not close your door or window, dogs may come in. I once found a dog in my house and had to chase it out. There are many rabbits in my area. They are big and dig up plants and lawns. My cats like to hunt them. We also see many birds like sparrows and hummingbirds. Sometimes a hawk or eagle flies by. But the crows chase it away. There are no stores near me. But if you walk down to the waterfront, there are restaurants that serve fresh fish. The bay is not very wide. You can see the other side even on cloudy days.",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. My house is on a street that connects two state highways. We have a bit more traffic on our street, but it is quiet. Not many people move in or out of our neighborhood. I know most of my neighbors. They work in their yards and do daily chores. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our street. Our house is on a corner, so we see people coming and going. We notice new cars. Some neighbors walk for exercise or their dogs. Children play on their bikes. I work from my house. My wife and I have two daughters. We get outside and play even when it rains. We grill in our backyard. It smells good. People cut their grass often. We have many trees, so it is cool and shady. But we have a lot of leaves in the fall. We must clean up the leaves every year. I like the smell of burning leaves. It means fall is here. We have not had much winter lately, so it feels like fall is long. I like to work on my truck in my garage. It is at the back of my house. I do not use the front door much. I like to be close to the neighborhood when I work in the garage. On holidays, we visit with our neighbors who are not from around here. We have a few cars parked in front of our house. I like living here. If it were not a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "I live in a neighborhood in the desert. There is a lot of dirt. You see brown everywhere. When you see a green lawn, it is special. People work hard to keep it green. \n\nWhen I first moved here, the houses were far apart. Now there are more houses. It looks like a city. But it is still a small town. Most people are friendly. Some are not. My neighborhood is a good place to live. There are friendly old people. I like it here.\n\nThere are not many stores with many choices. You can find basic things like food and clothes. If you want special food, you have to go to another town. Many people work in construction. The town is still growing. There are many empty spaces. I like it the way it is now. I moved from a big city to a small town. I do not want to go back.\n\nI work in construction. I install drywall and T-bars. I like the animals in the desert. People come here to see the desert's beauty. The desert is a hard place to live. It has many types of animals. We should learn about the animals so we can live with them peacefully.\n\nMy children like the animals. They are outside now, trying to catch lizards and bugs. We like living here. Victorville is a good place for families to visit. You can see the desert in a new way. There is a fair every year. You should come and visit in the summer. You can also go to Wrightwood to see the snow and ski. If you like history and nature, visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has rocks, old bones, and things from Native American people.",
            "My neighborhood is a little different. It is the college campus where I live. My community is the people in my dorm. I also consider the rest of the campus my neighborhood. My campus neighborhood is not like most neighborhoods. It has some things in common, however.\n\nLet's talk about the buildings in my neighborhood. There are three kinds of houses. Some are apartments. These buildings have 2 to 4 people in each room. There are 4 to 6 rooms on each floor. Most buildings have 2 floors. This means there are about 20 people in each building. Some houses are for rent. They have 2 to 4 bedrooms. Few students live in these houses. Most students live in dorms. These are the most common type of housing. A few students share a room.\n\nMy school is proud of its diversity. People from many cultures and ages live in my neighborhood. Some staff members live in houses. New students live in dorms. Older students live in apartments. Now, let's talk about the stores and park in my neighborhood. My school is like its own neighborhood. It has many stores. They sell food, clothes, and other things. The park is a place for everyone. It is clean and safe because of the people in my neighborhood.",
            "I have lived in this neighborhood for 10 years. I was sad when I first moved here from Riverdale. I missed my friends and family, but my mom and dad wanted a better life for me and my sister. They wanted a better house, a good high school, and a safe place.\n\nOver time, I made new friends and new enemies. I never really got to know my neighbors until I met Mr. Glen and his family. They are nice people. We consider them like family. I enjoyed their wedding. It was fun.\n\nI remember Mr. Glen's wife threw away her crutch, and I caught the strap. We all danced and had a good time. I played with their daughter Marsharii. I hope she's happy now.\n\nThe neighborhood is like a maze, but I have a GPS now. I can explore it. I like to play video games with my friends Kason and Curtis. We also play outside and go to the park. It's peaceful there. I like to practice my balance with sticks from Home Depot. I also have a wooden sword.\n\nThere is a basketball and tennis court. I used to play tennis with my dad and Mr. Graves. They made us work hard, but it was fun. I think I've had a good time in this neighborhood. I am excited to see what the future holds.",
            "I like my neighborhood because it is close to my college. I can walk to class. There are many apartment buildings in my neighborhood. Some buildings have restaurants and bars. These places are fun and not very expensive. One bar changed its name recently. It is more expensive, but the staff and drinks are good.\n\nMany people live in my neighborhood. They are mostly students or people who do not make a lot of money. The rent is not high. There is an elementary school nearby. Many children live in the area.\n\nI do not know my neighbors well. They smoke a lot of marijuana. The manager of my building put a device to take away bad smells outside their door. My boyfriend and I think this is funny. It is like a joke.\n\nThe buildings in my area are old, but they may have new insides. Some buildings near the campus are new. But I do not like them. They were not built well, but the rent is high. I think this is unfair.\n\nThere is a cheap restaurant near my home. They serve food on paper plates. Most of their food is cooked in a microwave. Across from this restaurant is a gas station. This is a place people do not like to work.\n\nThe road near my home was fixed with money from the city. Now there is a wide sidewalk and many trees. My area is more beautiful now.\n\nMy apartment building has many trees around it. The manager cut some of the trees, so there are stumps. There are more trees near my home than in another street. Behind my building is a line of trees and another set of apartments.\n\nI live on 42nd Street. Behind me is 43rd Street. This street is not as nice. The sidewalk is broken and the buildings look old. There are many trees on this street. Maybe the trees hide the bad buildings. There has been some crime near my home. But it happens in other places too. I like my neighborhood. It is close to my college. There is a store and a bus stop near my home. I can easily go to the store or downtown.",
            "My neighborhood is made up of houses that look like single houses. But they are connected. Each house is painted yellow, with a white porch and a green roof. Most people know each other. We stand together at the end of a street some evenings. We talk and watch the children play outside. It is a happy time in a busy world. It is like living in the past.\n\nWe live near fields and trees. The sky is blue and there are white clouds. We have beautiful weather usually. But sometimes we get bad weather. Last night we had a tornado warning. We had to go to a safe place. I was in the bathtub with my little dog. My other dog stayed in the living room. He was very nervous. \n\nAfter the storm, the road was hot. The hail had melted on the ground. The sun came out and it started to rain. We saw a beautiful rainbow. I took a picture with my camera. My friends and family liked the picture. It made them happy. The street was quiet for a while after the storm. Then people started coming home. We went back to normal. \n\nI like my neighborhood. It is a nice place to live. I have a small apartment with two rooms and two bathrooms. But my apartment is not the same as my neighbors'. Some apartments are very small. I like to walk in the big field behind my house. I see deer and hear a big frog singing. It is a good place to live. We are close to the city of Charlotte. We have roosters singing in the morning. We also have a donkey at a nearby farm. He brays in the evening. I am lucky to live here.",
            "I moved here when I was about to start eighth grade. At first, I had a hard time making friends. But then I got close to two people who lived near me. They do not live here anymore, but I still remember them. Most of the people who lived here when I arrived are still here. My neighborhood is like many American suburban neighborhoods. There are many two-story houses. Every weekend, I hear kids playing outside when it is warm. The neighborhood is usually quiet most days. I have never had a problem with anyone in the neighborhood. They leave you alone unless you need help. I have ordered packages online and never had a problem with them being stolen. I feel safe in my neighborhood. There is a park nearby. I have many good memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with my friends. I also got hurt there once when someone hit me in the nose playing football. But I like the good memories more. Now, I go to the park to spend time with my younger cousin's kids. They like to play on swings and slides. The park makes me feel happy and sad at the same time. My neighborhood is different from others. You can find many kinds of food nearby. There are Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants within one mile. But many people use food delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash now. There are also many fast food places and pizza shops. We have many stores with everything we need. There are dry cleaners, a pharmacy, and a grocery store. Some stores are special, like an Indian store where you can buy Indian food or ingredients to make it. I like my neighborhood. Reading about bad things that happen to people with their neighbors makes me happy to have a good one.",
            "My neighborhood is a small town in South Carolina. It is not special, but it is important. Johnston is called the Peach Capital of the World. Many peach trees and cattle are in this area. Houses are far apart from each other. They are usually two stories high with metal or gray roofs to keep cool in the hot summer.\n\nThere are no stores near me, but in the center of town, there is a stop light. This is where you can find stores. There are three places to eat fast food: Hong Kong, a Chinese restaurant; Fiesta, a Mexican restaurant; and Gary's, a burger place. There used to be a pizza place, but it closed.\n\nThere is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. People go there for Cherry Coca-Cola. There is also a grocery store called IGA. But people often go to Walmart in another town to buy most of their groceries.\n\nThe most popular store is Dollar General. It sells many things and is always busy. There is a furniture store called Possibilities Furniture. It has been in Johnston for a long time. They deliver furniture to your house. Next to the furniture store is a place called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They take care of animals.\n\nThere is a school called Johnston Elementary School. Children go there until they are in fifth grade. Then they go to another town for middle and high school. We are making a new park. But right now, there is nothing much to do in Johnston. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or playgrounds. But it is a nice town.",
            "I first heard about my area from a podcast about people who are missing. It was a surprise. Many apartments in the area cost over one thousand dollars a month. I had not heard about this story before. Neither had my friends. Maybe this is what makes it hard. I know some of my friends feel sad at night. Things are expensive, but we have learned to save money. We like things that are cheap. We like the smell of old toys and clothing. When you grow up, you do not smell as much. Some people start to smoke. Some people get used to the situation. But the flea market is always there. The smell of old magazines on a piano is strong. It stays in the leather even after you wash it. There are three second-hand stores near my home. You can walk to them. If you start on one side, you can visit two charity stores, a library, a rare book store and a special shop. The streets are crowded in the city center. Cars and people are everywhere in the morning. But inside the stores, it is quiet. It is a good place to spend an afternoon. Many people come to the city every year. It is a city that is growing. One of the big companies that sells things online and delivers them is based here. The city is still getting better. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is busy with their own goals. Nobody usually asks for help. You can be alone if you want. People will leave you alone. This is different from the South, where people care about each other. Here, you do not ask personal questions. You can keep to yourself if you want to. The city is lively. There are musicians living next door and singers upstairs. There is always something happening. We do not feel like strangers in our apartment building. We are like friends. We help each other when we need it. We celebrate birthdays and help each other when we are sad. I like my neighbors. They are kind to me. I try to be kind to them too. I clean after myself and leave food for them. They do the same. We bring mail to each other. It's nice to see them. I think they like my company as much as I like theirs. I live in a big building. It is not very human. But my neighbors make me feel like I am not alone.",
            "I live in a common type of neighborhood. It is like many others. My neighborhood is in a suburban area. You can see this when you look at the houses. They are all the same. The homeowner's association makes sure they are kept in good condition. The front yards are similar. There is a small patch of grass, some small stones, and a short driveway. The houses are usually one story, but some are two stories.\n\nThe roads in our neighborhood are very good. They are new and smooth. You do not see many potholes. The neighborhood has many things that make it nice to live here. We have community pools that anyone can use. There are walking trails where you can walk your dog or take a walk by yourself. We have a lot of space, so you can walk around the neighborhood to get exercise.\n\nMost people in the neighborhood are old. But we also have some middle-aged and young people. The neighborhood is safe. Everyone looks out for each other. We have many things that people need, like a mall. It is not very big, but it works. We have many stores, including ones that sell healthy food and ones that have cheap things.\n\nIt takes 15 minutes to drive to the city. But when you get there, you can find many stores. We have many nice things in our neighborhood. The neighborhood is safe and well-maintained. We have pools and walking trails. But we do not have stores right next door. You can just drive to the city and find what you need.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest. It is near a big city. My neighborhood is on the east side of the town. It is not the best area. Many houses are rented or owned by people who do not have a lot of money. But it is not a bad place. My neighbors are friendly. They say hello when I walk down the street.\n\nCrime is a little higher in my neighborhood. There have been some bad crimes in the past. Some people have been shot and killed. But we are lucky. We have not been hurt. Sometimes, things go missing from our porch if we leave them outside.\n\nThe town I live in is affected by a big problem called the opioid epidemic. Many people have died from a strong drug called fentanyl. But we have help. There are places where people can go to get better. They can learn to stop using the drug.\n\nMy son goes to a good school. The teachers and staff are kind. He has friends and likes to go to school. The school gives free breakfast and lunch to all students. No one goes hungry. The town is trying to make our neighborhood look better. They have fixed roads and parks. But they have not done much on our side of town.\n\nI like living here. People are friendly, the schools are good, and there are stores to buy things we need. Our home is not expensive, but it is comfortable. I have lived here for 16 years. I do not want to move.",
            "My neighborhood is special. It is on a hill. Many old buildings are there. They have history. I live in a 7-story apartment building near an old theater. A bar is a block away. People go there on warm summer nights. Many people want to go in, so there is a long line. A park is a few blocks away. It is big. People walk around the park on a concrete path. There are stairs in the wall. In the winter, homeless people put up tents. They are close together. They keep warm. They are close to a center where people can bathe and shower.\n\nI like my city. I like the people. Many years ago, this was a bad place. There was much violence. The government and police came to clean the streets. The people remember. They still tell stories about it. The people work hard to keep the neighborhood clean. They care about what happens in their city.\n\nSome people say you should not walk in my neighborhood at night if you are white. I think this is not true. I am light-skinned, but I feel like I am one of them. I know the neighborhood is rough. But I feel safe there. People are kind. A laundromat owner helped me when I was in trouble. Someone gave me money when I was cold and grey. They said I was beautiful.\n\nThis is my home. I feel alive when I walk in the neighborhood at night. I meet people who are kind. They are my friends.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan, in the United States. This is a place where farmland and small tourist cities are common. You will not find big city malls or big stores like Walmart or Target. If you want to go somewhere, you must use a car. But my town is one of the most beautiful places in the world. We have a lot of water around us. Beautiful Lake Michigan is on one side, and Lake Charlevoix is on the other. You can find a beach to swim in almost everywhere you go.\n\nMy neighborhood is like a small town. Houses are not close together. They are not the same. Some houses are old and some are new. Many houses have basements. You can see the basements from the road. Most houses have aluminum siding. You can see many different colors in the houses around my home. Every house has a yard. Some yards have trampolines and playsets for kids. Some people have gardens and fences for their animals.\n\nThe people who live here are hard workers. They work to make a living and raise their families. On any day, you will see kids playing outside and people walking their dogs or riding bicycles. Neighbors know each other and can tell who belongs and who does not. Everyone is friendly and says hello to each other. The lawns are well cared for. Leaves are not piled up on the lawns. The grass is cut and kept under control. People take care of their plants and bushes.\n\nThis is not a beautiful neighborhood that you think is very nice when you see it. But it is a good place to live. It is quiet and peaceful and safe. You can walk to the police station and the health department. The city's recycling center is nearby. We also have baseball and softball fields where you can hear the announcers calling the game. Our small airport is near the fields. You can hear the small planes flying and landing. You can walk to get ice cream or go downtown from my neighborhood. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, which is only a few blocks away. This is a great place to live."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "I live in a big city. My neighborhood is very diverse. Many different kinds of buildings are here. Homes and offices are near stores and restaurants. There are many places to eat and shop. Some stores are big and well-known. Others are small and unique. They are in malls or on streets. These streets are near quiet neighborhoods. But they are not quiet because of the many interesting places.\n\nThere are parks near my home. Many people visit these parks with their young children. My neighborhood has many different kinds of people. There is a big LGBTQ+ community. There are also Orthodox Jews and people from the former Soviet Union. Many other people from different countries live in the city. Some live in areas like Korea Town, China Town, and Little Armenia.\n\nBut getting around the city is difficult. It takes a long time to drive just a few miles. This is because of traffic. Most people do not walk in the city. We have a lot of cars, and it is hard to find places to park. The city is building more buildings. This means more people will come and drive. Some people do not like this.\n\nThere are many kinds of homes in the city. Not everyone lives in big buildings. Some people live in houses or small apartments. My neighborhood is the same. There are many different kinds of homes. People of all ages live here. I do not know most of my neighbors. But I have good memories of playing with friends when I was a child.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. It has single-family homes. Some homes are attached, but still separate. My home has a small yard and a small driveway. Most homes look like they did many years ago. That was when living in the suburbs was the American dream. Many people still like our neighborhood. They like the homes and the way it looks. But people are not as happy as they used to be. The yards are not kept up well. But there are still cars in every driveway. Children play outside as if the world is all they have. We have a school that has been here for almost 90 years. It still looks good and makes young people think about the future. Older people remember the good old days when they were young. We have a few churches, but they are not used much. The basketball courts are still busy. All the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a big store called Super A. It is owned by a Yemeni family. They are probably the only Arab family in our neighborhood. Most people in our neighborhood are African American. Our streets are wide and children play football. Most people have lived here for a long time. They can tell stories of when everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school, but it closed. Now it is a pharmacy. People think medicine makes everything better. We have a small movie theater that shows old movies at a low price. Young people do not like it because it does not have new movies. Older people like it because it is cheap and a good way to go out. We have a highway that goes through our town. But the entrance and exit are in the next town. Some people wanted a highway exit in our town, but others did not. They said it would hurt our town. The town council agreed with them. We are getting a new high school. We are trying to decide on a name for it. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be a good name for our town.",
            "You might not notice it at first. It is a residential area behind a shopping strip. Not a place people usually want to live. But if you walk behind the old, abandoned store, you will find a community. \n\nThe community has apartment buildings. They are next to each other. These buildings are like connected houses. The first apartments you see have been in the news for bad things. We will not talk about them too much. But the other buildings are a different story. Almost no one knows about this part of the community.\n\nAcross from these buildings is a school. It is a small college. Students go there to learn. They arrive in the morning with coffee and yawn. The gates open slowly. Commuters get angry because the students cause traffic.\n\nA road meets another road here. On one side is a park. On the other side is a place to help people with broken bones. The center has comfortable chairs and a fan that moves the air. Children play in the park. They run and play with their friends. Old people walk their dogs and look at the teenagers on their skateboards.\n\nThere is a store with cheap food. There is a store for swimming pools. There is a place for people to get their nails done. You can fill your pool while getting food and a manicure. There is a store for frozen yogurt. Teenagers eat cold yogurt and do tricks on their skateboards.\n\nThis neighborhood is a part of America. It is a place with a lot of history. Not much changes here. Time seems to go slowly.",
            "She looked out the window and asked, \"Where are we?\" The fields of corn stretched far out. \"This is it,\" I said. She looked surprised. She was from a town where the grocery store was close to her house. She had never seen so much open space. I told her what it was like to grow up in a small town in Ohio. She finally understood who I was.\n\nWe drove down a country road. There was a big hole in the ground filled with water. Just past it was my neighborhood. The houses were made of brick and stucco. Each house had a lot of land. People take care of their land. In the spring, flowers and trees are beautiful. The driveways have expensive cars. My Korean neighbor is always outside. He mows his lawn and sings. Everyone likes him. He is a kind person. He used to be a doctor. Now he is older and sometimes forgetful.\n\nAs we drove, you will see my house. There are geese in the yard. Our dog chases them. Behind my house is a stream. You can hear the water, frogs, and sometimes cows from the farms. A bridge made of wood leads to a special place. There are trees, herbs, and flowers that grow naturally. This is where I spent most of my childhood. I built forts and played with my friends.\n\nIn the winter, it can be very cold. But it is also beautiful. The trees look bare and the yard is empty. Sometimes it snows and the yard looks like a winter wonderland. My little sister and I would make snow angels and snowmen. We would fight and use snowballs as weapons. We built forts made of branches. We would play pretend and forget about everything else.",
            "Portland is a city in Oregon. It is famous for being weird. The city's unofficial slogan is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" This means the city is different from other places. Some people think this is good. They see it as a fun and creative place. Others think it is a call to come and visit. They will not be judged for being different. \n\nThe city has changed. Many rich people from California have moved here. They have built new homes. Some people are not happy about this change. But Portland is still a weird place. It accepts things that other places do not. The city has modern things like everyone else. People buy things from China. In Portland, you can find many different kinds of people. There are business people, artists, and people who like yoga. The city has colorful houses and gardens. There are free boxes on the street. These boxes have things that people are getting rid of. You never know what you might find. It is like a treasure hunt.\n\nNot everyone likes Portland. Some people do not want to take things from the street. They go to special events like goat yoga. This is a kind of yoga with real goats. Others go to soccer games. Portland has a problem with drugs. This is because of mental health problems. The weather in Portland is also a problem. It is often rainy and gray. The city also has a problem with people who do not have a home. The city has good services for these people, but they are not enough. Some people in the city do not know what to do with this problem. They are happy with the city's weirdness, but not with its problems.",
            "The mountains are always there. They stand in the north, watching the sun rise and set every day. They do not change. They are strong and calm. They do not change even when I am busy with my life and work.\n\nWhen I am very stressed, the mountains remind me to stop and rest. They give me strength to go on. I moved here when I started college. The mountains north of campus were beautiful and caught my attention. The university has many nice buildings, ponds, and trees. But the mountains are special. The rest of the town is nice too. There are many cafes where I studied and drank coffee. I can walk or take the bus to the downtown area. The buildings there are old and pleasant. They make me feel calm. But the mountains have a strong presence. The town is a mix of calm and busy places. It is like a small town and a big city combined. I can walk to the library to find peace. The library is quiet and calm.\n\nI have happy and sad memories in this town. I walked with friends in the park and went to the movie theater. The ponds are a good place to think and cry. I have had my share of crying there. I like to watch the animals living by the pond. They remind me of my own life and purpose. I walked past the pond and park to the main street. The sun was shining and I saw the mountains. They were as strong and calm as always. They reminded me to keep going.",
            "If you visit Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you will have no problem finding it. Public transportation is easy to use. Many people in New York City use it. Bensonhurst is a busy neighborhood. You will feel like you are in New York City. There are many Asian stores in the area. This is because many Asians live there. You will see an Asian store on almost every block. The stores sell food and do laundry. People like these stores because the food is good, prices are low, and it is easy to go there. \n\nThere are four Asian stores near me. You can walk to them in two minutes. This makes it easy to buy food. Bensonhurst is not only Asian. Many different kinds of people live there. They are from many countries. Many Asian people own businesses in the neighborhood. There is a nice park near me. It has basketball courts, a big field for soccer or baseball, and a playground for kids. This park is fun for everyone. \n\nThe neighborhood is not very tall. There are no big buildings. Most people live in small houses or apartments. The people are nice, but they can be noisy. You will hear cars playing loud music as they drive by. People also drive fast, which can wake you up. If you visit at night, be careful. This neighborhood is safe, but some people can cause trouble. I have had problems in the past, but that was a long time ago. There are also thieves who take packages. People do not clean up after their dogs. You will see dog waste on the street every day. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!",
            "I do not like my sidewalk. Where I live, everything goes downhill. My house is at the top of a big hill. People call it the \"exercise hill\" because runners like to run up it. There is no sidewalk on my street. Everyone walks on the road. The road has many holes and is not safe to drive on. There are many wires above the road. They look old and broken. It rains a lot in my area. The wind breaks the wires and causes trouble. There are many big trees everywhere. But people do not like the trees. They want to cut them down because they block the ocean view. That is why houses are built high on the hill. They have big windows to see the ocean. It is beautiful at sunset. The water shines and the sky turns orange. But it is often cloudy and damp. Moss grows on everything. It even grows on my car. I left my car outside for a month. When I went to use it, it was green and covered in moss. I had to clean it for a long time. There are not many children in my area. There is a school nearby, but most people are old and retired. They have dogs instead of kids. I see dogs in people's yards or running in the street. If you do not close your door or window, dogs may come in. I once found a dog in my house and had to chase it out. There are many rabbits in my area. They are big and dig up plants and lawns. My cats like to hunt them. We also see many birds like sparrows and hummingbirds. Sometimes a hawk or eagle flies by. But the crows chase it away. There are no stores near me. But if you walk down to the waterfront, there are restaurants that serve fresh fish. The bay is not very wide. You can see the other side even on cloudy days.",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. My house is on a street that connects two state highways. We have a bit more traffic on our street, but it is quiet. Not many people move in or out of our neighborhood. I know most of my neighbors. They work in their yards and do daily chores. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our street. Our house is on a corner, so we see people coming and going. We notice new cars. Some neighbors walk for exercise or their dogs. Children play on their bikes. I work from my house. My wife and I have two daughters. We get outside and play even when it rains. We grill in our backyard. It smells good. People cut their grass often. We have many trees, so it is cool and shady. But we have a lot of leaves in the fall. We must clean up the leaves every year. I like the smell of burning leaves. It means fall is here. We have not had much winter lately, so it feels like fall is long. I like to work on my truck in my garage. It is at the back of my house. I do not use the front door much. I like to be close to the neighborhood when I work in the garage. On holidays, we visit with our neighbors who are not from around here. We have a few cars parked in front of our house. I like living here. If it were not a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "I live in a neighborhood in the desert. There is a lot of dirt. You see brown everywhere. When you see a green lawn, it is special. People work hard to keep it green. \n\nWhen I first moved here, the houses were far apart. Now there are more houses. It looks like a city. But it is still a small town. Most people are friendly. Some are not. My neighborhood is a good place to live. There are friendly old people. I like it here.\n\nThere are not many stores with many choices. You can find basic things like food and clothes. If you want special food, you have to go to another town. Many people work in construction. The town is still growing. There are many empty spaces. I like it the way it is now. I moved from a big city to a small town. I do not want to go back.\n\nI work in construction. I install drywall and T-bars. I like the animals in the desert. People come here to see the desert's beauty. The desert is a hard place to live. It has many types of animals. We should learn about the animals so we can live with them peacefully.\n\nMy children like the animals. They are outside now, trying to catch lizards and bugs. We like living here. Victorville is a good place for families to visit. You can see the desert in a new way. There is a fair every year. You should come and visit in the summer. You can also go to Wrightwood to see the snow and ski. If you like history and nature, visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has rocks, old bones, and things from Native American people.",
            "My neighborhood is a little different. It is the college campus where I live. My community is the people in my dorm. I also consider the rest of the campus my neighborhood. My campus neighborhood is not like most neighborhoods. It has some things in common, however.\n\nLet's talk about the buildings in my neighborhood. There are three kinds of houses. Some are apartments. These buildings have 2 to 4 people in each room. There are 4 to 6 rooms on each floor. Most buildings have 2 floors. This means there are about 20 people in each building. Some houses are for rent. They have 2 to 4 bedrooms. Few students live in these houses. Most students live in dorms. These are the most common type of housing. A few students share a room.\n\nMy school is proud of its diversity. People from many cultures and ages live in my neighborhood. Some staff members live in houses. New students live in dorms. Older students live in apartments. Now, let's talk about the stores and park in my neighborhood. My school is like its own neighborhood. It has many stores. They sell food, clothes, and other things. The park is a place for everyone. It is clean and safe because of the people in my neighborhood.",
            "I have lived in this neighborhood for 10 years. I was sad when I first moved here from Riverdale. I missed my friends and family, but my mom and dad wanted a better life for me and my sister. They wanted a better house, a good high school, and a safe place.\n\nOver time, I made new friends and new enemies. I never really got to know my neighbors until I met Mr. Glen and his family. They are nice people. We consider them like family. I enjoyed their wedding. It was fun.\n\nI remember Mr. Glen's wife threw away her crutch, and I caught the strap. We all danced and had a good time. I played with their daughter Marsharii. I hope she's happy now.\n\nThe neighborhood is like a maze, but I have a GPS now. I can explore it. I like to play video games with my friends Kason and Curtis. We also play outside and go to the park. It's peaceful there. I like to practice my balance with sticks from Home Depot. I also have a wooden sword.\n\nThere is a basketball and tennis court. I used to play tennis with my dad and Mr. Graves. They made us work hard, but it was fun. I think I've had a good time in this neighborhood. I am excited to see what the future holds.",
            "I like my neighborhood because it is close to my college. I can walk to class. There are many apartment buildings in my neighborhood. Some buildings have restaurants and bars. These places are fun and not very expensive. One bar changed its name recently. It is more expensive, but the staff and drinks are good.\n\nMany people live in my neighborhood. They are mostly students or people who do not make a lot of money. The rent is not high. There is an elementary school nearby. Many children live in the area.\n\nI do not know my neighbors well. They smoke a lot of marijuana. The manager of my building put a device to take away bad smells outside their door. My boyfriend and I think this is funny. It is like a joke.\n\nThe buildings in my area are old, but they may have new insides. Some buildings near the campus are new. But I do not like them. They were not built well, but the rent is high. I think this is unfair.\n\nThere is a cheap restaurant near my home. They serve food on paper plates. Most of their food is cooked in a microwave. Across from this restaurant is a gas station. This is a place people do not like to work.\n\nThe road near my home was fixed with money from the city. Now there is a wide sidewalk and many trees. My area is more beautiful now.\n\nMy apartment building has many trees around it. The manager cut some of the trees, so there are stumps. There are more trees near my home than in another street. Behind my building is a line of trees and another set of apartments.\n\nI live on 42nd Street. Behind me is 43rd Street. This street is not as nice. The sidewalk is broken and the buildings look old. There are many trees on this street. Maybe the trees hide the bad buildings. There has been some crime near my home. But it happens in other places too. I like my neighborhood. It is close to my college. There is a store and a bus stop near my home. I can easily go to the store or downtown.",
            "My neighborhood is made up of houses that look like single houses. But they are connected. Each house is painted yellow, with a white porch and a green roof. Most people know each other. We stand together at the end of a street some evenings. We talk and watch the children play outside. It is a happy time in a busy world. It is like living in the past.\n\nWe live near fields and trees. The sky is blue and there are white clouds. We have beautiful weather usually. But sometimes we get bad weather. Last night we had a tornado warning. We had to go to a safe place. I was in the bathtub with my little dog. My other dog stayed in the living room. He was very nervous. \n\nAfter the storm, the road was hot. The hail had melted on the ground. The sun came out and it started to rain. We saw a beautiful rainbow. I took a picture with my camera. My friends and family liked the picture. It made them happy. The street was quiet for a while after the storm. Then people started coming home. We went back to normal. \n\nI like my neighborhood. It is a nice place to live. I have a small apartment with two rooms and two bathrooms. But my apartment is not the same as my neighbors'. Some apartments are very small. I like to walk in the big field behind my house. I see deer and hear a big frog singing. It is a good place to live. We are close to the city of Charlotte. We have roosters singing in the morning. We also have a donkey at a nearby farm. He brays in the evening. I am lucky to live here.",
            "I moved here when I was about to start eighth grade. At first, I had a hard time making friends. But then I got close to two people who lived near me. They do not live here anymore, but I still remember them. Most of the people who lived here when I arrived are still here. My neighborhood is like many American suburban neighborhoods. There are many two-story houses. Every weekend, I hear kids playing outside when it is warm. The neighborhood is usually quiet most days. I have never had a problem with anyone in the neighborhood. They leave you alone unless you need help. I have ordered packages online and never had a problem with them being stolen. I feel safe in my neighborhood. There is a park nearby. I have many good memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with my friends. I also got hurt there once when someone hit me in the nose playing football. But I like the good memories more. Now, I go to the park to spend time with my younger cousin's kids. They like to play on swings and slides. The park makes me feel happy and sad at the same time. My neighborhood is different from others. You can find many kinds of food nearby. There are Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants within one mile. But many people use food delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash now. There are also many fast food places and pizza shops. We have many stores with everything we need. There are dry cleaners, a pharmacy, and a grocery store. Some stores are special, like an Indian store where you can buy Indian food or ingredients to make it. I like my neighborhood. Reading about bad things that happen to people with their neighbors makes me happy to have a good one.",
            "My neighborhood is a small town in South Carolina. It is not special, but it is important. Johnston is called the Peach Capital of the World. Many peach trees and cattle are in this area. Houses are far apart from each other. They are usually two stories high with metal or gray roofs to keep cool in the hot summer.\n\nThere are no stores near me, but in the center of town, there is a stop light. This is where you can find stores. There are three places to eat fast food: Hong Kong, a Chinese restaurant; Fiesta, a Mexican restaurant; and Gary's, a burger place. There used to be a pizza place, but it closed.\n\nThere is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. People go there for Cherry Coca-Cola. There is also a grocery store called IGA. But people often go to Walmart in another town to buy most of their groceries.\n\nThe most popular store is Dollar General. It sells many things and is always busy. There is a furniture store called Possibilities Furniture. It has been in Johnston for a long time. They deliver furniture to your house. Next to the furniture store is a place called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They take care of animals.\n\nThere is a school called Johnston Elementary School. Children go there until they are in fifth grade. Then they go to another town for middle and high school. We are making a new park. But right now, there is nothing much to do in Johnston. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or playgrounds. But it is a nice town.",
            "I first heard about my area from a podcast about people who are missing. It was a surprise. Many apartments in the area cost over one thousand dollars a month. I had not heard about this story before. Neither had my friends. Maybe this is what makes it hard. I know some of my friends feel sad at night. Things are expensive, but we have learned to save money. We like things that are cheap. We like the smell of old toys and clothing. When you grow up, you do not smell as much. Some people start to smoke. Some people get used to the situation. But the flea market is always there. The smell of old magazines on a piano is strong. It stays in the leather even after you wash it. There are three second-hand stores near my home. You can walk to them. If you start on one side, you can visit two charity stores, a library, a rare book store and a special shop. The streets are crowded in the city center. Cars and people are everywhere in the morning. But inside the stores, it is quiet. It is a good place to spend an afternoon. Many people come to the city every year. It is a city that is growing. One of the big companies that sells things online and delivers them is based here. The city is still getting better. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is busy with their own goals. Nobody usually asks for help. You can be alone if you want. People will leave you alone. This is different from the South, where people care about each other. Here, you do not ask personal questions. You can keep to yourself if you want to. The city is lively. There are musicians living next door and singers upstairs. There is always something happening. We do not feel like strangers in our apartment building. We are like friends. We help each other when we need it. We celebrate birthdays and help each other when we are sad. I like my neighbors. They are kind to me. I try to be kind to them too. I clean after myself and leave food for them. They do the same. We bring mail to each other. It's nice to see them. I think they like my company as much as I like theirs. I live in a big building. It is not very human. But my neighbors make me feel like I am not alone.",
            "I live in a common type of neighborhood. It is like many others. My neighborhood is in a suburban area. You can see this when you look at the houses. They are all the same. The homeowner's association makes sure they are kept in good condition. The front yards are similar. There is a small patch of grass, some small stones, and a short driveway. The houses are usually one story, but some are two stories.\n\nThe roads in our neighborhood are very good. They are new and smooth. You do not see many potholes. The neighborhood has many things that make it nice to live here. We have community pools that anyone can use. There are walking trails where you can walk your dog or take a walk by yourself. We have a lot of space, so you can walk around the neighborhood to get exercise.\n\nMost people in the neighborhood are old. But we also have some middle-aged and young people. The neighborhood is safe. Everyone looks out for each other. We have many things that people need, like a mall. It is not very big, but it works. We have many stores, including ones that sell healthy food and ones that have cheap things.\n\nIt takes 15 minutes to drive to the city. But when you get there, you can find many stores. We have many nice things in our neighborhood. The neighborhood is safe and well-maintained. We have pools and walking trails. But we do not have stores right next door. You can just drive to the city and find what you need.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest. It is near a big city. My neighborhood is on the east side of the town. It is not the best area. Many houses are rented or owned by people who do not have a lot of money. But it is not a bad place. My neighbors are friendly. They say hello when I walk down the street.\n\nCrime is a little higher in my neighborhood. There have been some bad crimes in the past. Some people have been shot and killed. But we are lucky. We have not been hurt. Sometimes, things go missing from our porch if we leave them outside.\n\nThe town I live in is affected by a big problem called the opioid epidemic. Many people have died from a strong drug called fentanyl. But we have help. There are places where people can go to get better. They can learn to stop using the drug.\n\nMy son goes to a good school. The teachers and staff are kind. He has friends and likes to go to school. The school gives free breakfast and lunch to all students. No one goes hungry. The town is trying to make our neighborhood look better. They have fixed roads and parks. But they have not done much on our side of town.\n\nI like living here. People are friendly, the schools are good, and there are stores to buy things we need. Our home is not expensive, but it is comfortable. I have lived here for 16 years. I do not want to move.",
            "My neighborhood is special. It is on a hill. Many old buildings are there. They have history. I live in a 7-story apartment building near an old theater. A bar is a block away. People go there on warm summer nights. Many people want to go in, so there is a long line. A park is a few blocks away. It is big. People walk around the park on a concrete path. There are stairs in the wall. In the winter, homeless people put up tents. They are close together. They keep warm. They are close to a center where people can bathe and shower.\n\nI like my city. I like the people. Many years ago, this was a bad place. There was much violence. The government and police came to clean the streets. The people remember. They still tell stories about it. The people work hard to keep the neighborhood clean. They care about what happens in their city.\n\nSome people say you should not walk in my neighborhood at night if you are white. I think this is not true. I am light-skinned, but I feel like I am one of them. I know the neighborhood is rough. But I feel safe there. People are kind. A laundromat owner helped me when I was in trouble. Someone gave me money when I was cold and grey. They said I was beautiful.\n\nThis is my home. I feel alive when I walk in the neighborhood at night. I meet people who are kind. They are my friends.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan, in the United States. This is a place where farmland and small tourist cities are common. You will not find big city malls or big stores like Walmart or Target. If you want to go somewhere, you must use a car. But my town is one of the most beautiful places in the world. We have a lot of water around us. Beautiful Lake Michigan is on one side, and Lake Charlevoix is on the other. You can find a beach to swim in almost everywhere you go.\n\nMy neighborhood is like a small town. Houses are not close together. They are not the same. Some houses are old and some are new. Many houses have basements. You can see the basements from the road. Most houses have aluminum siding. You can see many different colors in the houses around my home. Every house has a yard. Some yards have trampolines and playsets for kids. Some people have gardens and fences for their animals.\n\nThe people who live here are hard workers. They work to make a living and raise their families. On any day, you will see kids playing outside and people walking their dogs or riding bicycles. Neighbors know each other and can tell who belongs and who does not. Everyone is friendly and says hello to each other. The lawns are well cared for. Leaves are not piled up on the lawns. The grass is cut and kept under control. People take care of their plants and bushes.\n\nThis is not a beautiful neighborhood that you think is very nice when you see it. But it is a good place to live. It is quiet and peaceful and safe. You can walk to the police station and the health department. The city's recycling center is nearby. We also have baseball and softball fields where you can hear the announcers calling the game. Our small airport is near the fields. You can hear the small planes flying and landing. You can walk to get ice cream or go downtown from my neighborhood. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, which is only a few blocks away. This is a great place to live."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "I live in a big city. My neighborhood is very diverse. Many different kinds of buildings are here. Homes and offices are near stores and restaurants. There are many places to eat and shop. Some stores are big and well-known. Others are small and unique. They are in malls or on streets. These streets are near quiet neighborhoods. But they are not quiet because of the many interesting places.\n\nThere are parks near my home. Many people visit these parks with their young children. My neighborhood has many different kinds of people. There is a big LGBTQ+ community. There are also Orthodox Jews and people from the former Soviet Union. Many other people from different countries live in the city. Some live in areas like Korea Town, China Town, and Little Armenia.\n\nBut getting around the city is difficult. It takes a long time to drive just a few miles. This is because of traffic. Most people do not walk in the city. We have a lot of cars, and it is hard to find places to park. The city is building more buildings. This means more people will come and drive. Some people do not like this.\n\nThere are many kinds of homes in the city. Not everyone lives in big buildings. Some people live in houses or small apartments. My neighborhood is the same. There are many different kinds of homes. People of all ages live here. I do not know most of my neighbors. But I have good memories of playing with friends when I was a child.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. It has single-family homes. Some homes are attached, but still separate. My home has a small yard and a small driveway. Most homes look like they did many years ago. That was when living in the suburbs was the American dream. Many people still like our neighborhood. They like the homes and the way it looks. But people are not as happy as they used to be. The yards are not kept up well. But there are still cars in every driveway. Children play outside as if the world is all they have. We have a school that has been here for almost 90 years. It still looks good and makes young people think about the future. Older people remember the good old days when they were young. We have a few churches, but they are not used much. The basketball courts are still busy. All the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a big store called Super A. It is owned by a Yemeni family. They are probably the only Arab family in our neighborhood. Most people in our neighborhood are African American. Our streets are wide and children play football. Most people have lived here for a long time. They can tell stories of when everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school, but it closed. Now it is a pharmacy. People think medicine makes everything better. We have a small movie theater that shows old movies at a low price. Young people do not like it because it does not have new movies. Older people like it because it is cheap and a good way to go out. We have a highway that goes through our town. But the entrance and exit are in the next town. Some people wanted a highway exit in our town, but others did not. They said it would hurt our town. The town council agreed with them. We are getting a new high school. We are trying to decide on a name for it. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be a good name for our town.",
            "You might not notice it at first. It is a residential area behind a shopping strip. Not a place people usually want to live. But if you walk behind the old, abandoned store, you will find a community. \n\nThe community has apartment buildings. They are next to each other. These buildings are like connected houses. The first apartments you see have been in the news for bad things. We will not talk about them too much. But the other buildings are a different story. Almost no one knows about this part of the community.\n\nAcross from these buildings is a school. It is a small college. Students go there to learn. They arrive in the morning with coffee and yawn. The gates open slowly. Commuters get angry because the students cause traffic.\n\nA road meets another road here. On one side is a park. On the other side is a place to help people with broken bones. The center has comfortable chairs and a fan that moves the air. Children play in the park. They run and play with their friends. Old people walk their dogs and look at the teenagers on their skateboards.\n\nThere is a store with cheap food. There is a store for swimming pools. There is a place for people to get their nails done. You can fill your pool while getting food and a manicure. There is a store for frozen yogurt. Teenagers eat cold yogurt and do tricks on their skateboards.\n\nThis neighborhood is a part of America. It is a place with a lot of history. Not much changes here. Time seems to go slowly.",
            "She looked out the window and asked, \"Where are we?\" The fields of corn stretched far out. \"This is it,\" I said. She looked surprised. She was from a town where the grocery store was close to her house. She had never seen so much open space. I told her what it was like to grow up in a small town in Ohio. She finally understood who I was.\n\nWe drove down a country road. There was a big hole in the ground filled with water. Just past it was my neighborhood. The houses were made of brick and stucco. Each house had a lot of land. People take care of their land. In the spring, flowers and trees are beautiful. The driveways have expensive cars. My Korean neighbor is always outside. He mows his lawn and sings. Everyone likes him. He is a kind person. He used to be a doctor. Now he is older and sometimes forgetful.\n\nAs we drove, you will see my house. There are geese in the yard. Our dog chases them. Behind my house is a stream. You can hear the water, frogs, and sometimes cows from the farms. A bridge made of wood leads to a special place. There are trees, herbs, and flowers that grow naturally. This is where I spent most of my childhood. I built forts and played with my friends.\n\nIn the winter, it can be very cold. But it is also beautiful. The trees look bare and the yard is empty. Sometimes it snows and the yard looks like a winter wonderland. My little sister and I would make snow angels and snowmen. We would fight and use snowballs as weapons. We built forts made of branches. We would play pretend and forget about everything else.",
            "Portland is a city in Oregon. It is famous for being weird. The city's unofficial slogan is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" This means the city is different from other places. Some people think this is good. They see it as a fun and creative place. Others think it is a call to come and visit. They will not be judged for being different. \n\nThe city has changed. Many rich people from California have moved here. They have built new homes. Some people are not happy about this change. But Portland is still a weird place. It accepts things that other places do not. The city has modern things like everyone else. People buy things from China. In Portland, you can find many different kinds of people. There are business people, artists, and people who like yoga. The city has colorful houses and gardens. There are free boxes on the street. These boxes have things that people are getting rid of. You never know what you might find. It is like a treasure hunt.\n\nNot everyone likes Portland. Some people do not want to take things from the street. They go to special events like goat yoga. This is a kind of yoga with real goats. Others go to soccer games. Portland has a problem with drugs. This is because of mental health problems. The weather in Portland is also a problem. It is often rainy and gray. The city also has a problem with people who do not have a home. The city has good services for these people, but they are not enough. Some people in the city do not know what to do with this problem. They are happy with the city's weirdness, but not with its problems.",
            "The mountains are always there. They stand in the north, watching the sun rise and set every day. They do not change. They are strong and calm. They do not change even when I am busy with my life and work.\n\nWhen I am very stressed, the mountains remind me to stop and rest. They give me strength to go on. I moved here when I started college. The mountains north of campus were beautiful and caught my attention. The university has many nice buildings, ponds, and trees. But the mountains are special. The rest of the town is nice too. There are many cafes where I studied and drank coffee. I can walk or take the bus to the downtown area. The buildings there are old and pleasant. They make me feel calm. But the mountains have a strong presence. The town is a mix of calm and busy places. It is like a small town and a big city combined. I can walk to the library to find peace. The library is quiet and calm.\n\nI have happy and sad memories in this town. I walked with friends in the park and went to the movie theater. The ponds are a good place to think and cry. I have had my share of crying there. I like to watch the animals living by the pond. They remind me of my own life and purpose. I walked past the pond and park to the main street. The sun was shining and I saw the mountains. They were as strong and calm as always. They reminded me to keep going.",
            "If you visit Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you will have no problem finding it. Public transportation is easy to use. Many people in New York City use it. Bensonhurst is a busy neighborhood. You will feel like you are in New York City. There are many Asian stores in the area. This is because many Asians live there. You will see an Asian store on almost every block. The stores sell food and do laundry. People like these stores because the food is good, prices are low, and it is easy to go there. \n\nThere are four Asian stores near me. You can walk to them in two minutes. This makes it easy to buy food. Bensonhurst is not only Asian. Many different kinds of people live there. They are from many countries. Many Asian people own businesses in the neighborhood. There is a nice park near me. It has basketball courts, a big field for soccer or baseball, and a playground for kids. This park is fun for everyone. \n\nThe neighborhood is not very tall. There are no big buildings. Most people live in small houses or apartments. The people are nice, but they can be noisy. You will hear cars playing loud music as they drive by. People also drive fast, which can wake you up. If you visit at night, be careful. This neighborhood is safe, but some people can cause trouble. I have had problems in the past, but that was a long time ago. There are also thieves who take packages. People do not clean up after their dogs. You will see dog waste on the street every day. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!",
            "I do not like my sidewalk. Where I live, everything goes downhill. My house is at the top of a big hill. People call it the \"exercise hill\" because runners like to run up it. There is no sidewalk on my street. Everyone walks on the road. The road has many holes and is not safe to drive on. There are many wires above the road. They look old and broken. It rains a lot in my area. The wind breaks the wires and causes trouble. There are many big trees everywhere. But people do not like the trees. They want to cut them down because they block the ocean view. That is why houses are built high on the hill. They have big windows to see the ocean. It is beautiful at sunset. The water shines and the sky turns orange. But it is often cloudy and damp. Moss grows on everything. It even grows on my car. I left my car outside for a month. When I went to use it, it was green and covered in moss. I had to clean it for a long time. There are not many children in my area. There is a school nearby, but most people are old and retired. They have dogs instead of kids. I see dogs in people's yards or running in the street. If you do not close your door or window, dogs may come in. I once found a dog in my house and had to chase it out. There are many rabbits in my area. They are big and dig up plants and lawns. My cats like to hunt them. We also see many birds like sparrows and hummingbirds. Sometimes a hawk or eagle flies by. But the crows chase it away. There are no stores near me. But if you walk down to the waterfront, there are restaurants that serve fresh fish. The bay is not very wide. You can see the other side even on cloudy days.",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. My house is on a street that connects two state highways. We have a bit more traffic on our street, but it is quiet. Not many people move in or out of our neighborhood. I know most of my neighbors. They work in their yards and do daily chores. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our street. Our house is on a corner, so we see people coming and going. We notice new cars. Some neighbors walk for exercise or their dogs. Children play on their bikes. I work from my house. My wife and I have two daughters. We get outside and play even when it rains. We grill in our backyard. It smells good. People cut their grass often. We have many trees, so it is cool and shady. But we have a lot of leaves in the fall. We must clean up the leaves every year. I like the smell of burning leaves. It means fall is here. We have not had much winter lately, so it feels like fall is long. I like to work on my truck in my garage. It is at the back of my house. I do not use the front door much. I like to be close to the neighborhood when I work in the garage. On holidays, we visit with our neighbors who are not from around here. We have a few cars parked in front of our house. I like living here. If it were not a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "I live in a neighborhood in the desert. There is a lot of dirt. You see brown everywhere. When you see a green lawn, it is special. People work hard to keep it green. \n\nWhen I first moved here, the houses were far apart. Now there are more houses. It looks like a city. But it is still a small town. Most people are friendly. Some are not. My neighborhood is a good place to live. There are friendly old people. I like it here.\n\nThere are not many stores with many choices. You can find basic things like food and clothes. If you want special food, you have to go to another town. Many people work in construction. The town is still growing. There are many empty spaces. I like it the way it is now. I moved from a big city to a small town. I do not want to go back.\n\nI work in construction. I install drywall and T-bars. I like the animals in the desert. People come here to see the desert's beauty. The desert is a hard place to live. It has many types of animals. We should learn about the animals so we can live with them peacefully.\n\nMy children like the animals. They are outside now, trying to catch lizards and bugs. We like living here. Victorville is a good place for families to visit. You can see the desert in a new way. There is a fair every year. You should come and visit in the summer. You can also go to Wrightwood to see the snow and ski. If you like history and nature, visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has rocks, old bones, and things from Native American people.",
            "My neighborhood is a little different. It is the college campus where I live. My community is the people in my dorm. I also consider the rest of the campus my neighborhood. My campus neighborhood is not like most neighborhoods. It has some things in common, however.\n\nLet's talk about the buildings in my neighborhood. There are three kinds of houses. Some are apartments. These buildings have 2 to 4 people in each room. There are 4 to 6 rooms on each floor. Most buildings have 2 floors. This means there are about 20 people in each building. Some houses are for rent. They have 2 to 4 bedrooms. Few students live in these houses. Most students live in dorms. These are the most common type of housing. A few students share a room.\n\nMy school is proud of its diversity. People from many cultures and ages live in my neighborhood. Some staff members live in houses. New students live in dorms. Older students live in apartments. Now, let's talk about the stores and park in my neighborhood. My school is like its own neighborhood. It has many stores. They sell food, clothes, and other things. The park is a place for everyone. It is clean and safe because of the people in my neighborhood.",
            "I have lived in this neighborhood for 10 years. I was sad when I first moved here from Riverdale. I missed my friends and family, but my mom and dad wanted a better life for me and my sister. They wanted a better house, a good high school, and a safe place.\n\nOver time, I made new friends and new enemies. I never really got to know my neighbors until I met Mr. Glen and his family. They are nice people. We consider them like family. I enjoyed their wedding. It was fun.\n\nI remember Mr. Glen's wife threw away her crutch, and I caught the strap. We all danced and had a good time. I played with their daughter Marsharii. I hope she's happy now.\n\nThe neighborhood is like a maze, but I have a GPS now. I can explore it. I like to play video games with my friends Kason and Curtis. We also play outside and go to the park. It's peaceful there. I like to practice my balance with sticks from Home Depot. I also have a wooden sword.\n\nThere is a basketball and tennis court. I used to play tennis with my dad and Mr. Graves. They made us work hard, but it was fun. I think I've had a good time in this neighborhood. I am excited to see what the future holds.",
            "I like my neighborhood because it is close to my college. I can walk to class. There are many apartment buildings in my neighborhood. Some buildings have restaurants and bars. These places are fun and not very expensive. One bar changed its name recently. It is more expensive, but the staff and drinks are good.\n\nMany people live in my neighborhood. They are mostly students or people who do not make a lot of money. The rent is not high. There is an elementary school nearby. Many children live in the area.\n\nI do not know my neighbors well. They smoke a lot of marijuana. The manager of my building put a device to take away bad smells outside their door. My boyfriend and I think this is funny. It is like a joke.\n\nThe buildings in my area are old, but they may have new insides. Some buildings near the campus are new. But I do not like them. They were not built well, but the rent is high. I think this is unfair.\n\nThere is a cheap restaurant near my home. They serve food on paper plates. Most of their food is cooked in a microwave. Across from this restaurant is a gas station. This is a place people do not like to work.\n\nThe road near my home was fixed with money from the city. Now there is a wide sidewalk and many trees. My area is more beautiful now.\n\nMy apartment building has many trees around it. The manager cut some of the trees, so there are stumps. There are more trees near my home than in another street. Behind my building is a line of trees and another set of apartments.\n\nI live on 42nd Street. Behind me is 43rd Street. This street is not as nice. The sidewalk is broken and the buildings look old. There are many trees on this street. Maybe the trees hide the bad buildings. There has been some crime near my home. But it happens in other places too. I like my neighborhood. It is close to my college. There is a store and a bus stop near my home. I can easily go to the store or downtown.",
            "My neighborhood is made up of houses that look like single houses. But they are connected. Each house is painted yellow, with a white porch and a green roof. Most people know each other. We stand together at the end of a street some evenings. We talk and watch the children play outside. It is a happy time in a busy world. It is like living in the past.\n\nWe live near fields and trees. The sky is blue and there are white clouds. We have beautiful weather usually. But sometimes we get bad weather. Last night we had a tornado warning. We had to go to a safe place. I was in the bathtub with my little dog. My other dog stayed in the living room. He was very nervous. \n\nAfter the storm, the road was hot. The hail had melted on the ground. The sun came out and it started to rain. We saw a beautiful rainbow. I took a picture with my camera. My friends and family liked the picture. It made them happy. The street was quiet for a while after the storm. Then people started coming home. We went back to normal. \n\nI like my neighborhood. It is a nice place to live. I have a small apartment with two rooms and two bathrooms. But my apartment is not the same as my neighbors'. Some apartments are very small. I like to walk in the big field behind my house. I see deer and hear a big frog singing. It is a good place to live. We are close to the city of Charlotte. We have roosters singing in the morning. We also have a donkey at a nearby farm. He brays in the evening. I am lucky to live here.",
            "I moved here when I was about to start eighth grade. At first, I had a hard time making friends. But then I got close to two people who lived near me. They do not live here anymore, but I still remember them. Most of the people who lived here when I arrived are still here. My neighborhood is like many American suburban neighborhoods. There are many two-story houses. Every weekend, I hear kids playing outside when it is warm. The neighborhood is usually quiet most days. I have never had a problem with anyone in the neighborhood. They leave you alone unless you need help. I have ordered packages online and never had a problem with them being stolen. I feel safe in my neighborhood. There is a park nearby. I have many good memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with my friends. I also got hurt there once when someone hit me in the nose playing football. But I like the good memories more. Now, I go to the park to spend time with my younger cousin's kids. They like to play on swings and slides. The park makes me feel happy and sad at the same time. My neighborhood is different from others. You can find many kinds of food nearby. There are Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants within one mile. But many people use food delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash now. There are also many fast food places and pizza shops. We have many stores with everything we need. There are dry cleaners, a pharmacy, and a grocery store. Some stores are special, like an Indian store where you can buy Indian food or ingredients to make it. I like my neighborhood. Reading about bad things that happen to people with their neighbors makes me happy to have a good one.",
            "My neighborhood is a small town in South Carolina. It is not special, but it is important. Johnston is called the Peach Capital of the World. Many peach trees and cattle are in this area. Houses are far apart from each other. They are usually two stories high with metal or gray roofs to keep cool in the hot summer.\n\nThere are no stores near me, but in the center of town, there is a stop light. This is where you can find stores. There are three places to eat fast food: Hong Kong, a Chinese restaurant; Fiesta, a Mexican restaurant; and Gary's, a burger place. There used to be a pizza place, but it closed.\n\nThere is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. People go there for Cherry Coca-Cola. There is also a grocery store called IGA. But people often go to Walmart in another town to buy most of their groceries.\n\nThe most popular store is Dollar General. It sells many things and is always busy. There is a furniture store called Possibilities Furniture. It has been in Johnston for a long time. They deliver furniture to your house. Next to the furniture store is a place called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They take care of animals.\n\nThere is a school called Johnston Elementary School. Children go there until they are in fifth grade. Then they go to another town for middle and high school. We are making a new park. But right now, there is nothing much to do in Johnston. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or playgrounds. But it is a nice town.",
            "I first heard about my area from a podcast about people who are missing. It was a surprise. Many apartments in the area cost over one thousand dollars a month. I had not heard about this story before. Neither had my friends. Maybe this is what makes it hard. I know some of my friends feel sad at night. Things are expensive, but we have learned to save money. We like things that are cheap. We like the smell of old toys and clothing. When you grow up, you do not smell as much. Some people start to smoke. Some people get used to the situation. But the flea market is always there. The smell of old magazines on a piano is strong. It stays in the leather even after you wash it. There are three second-hand stores near my home. You can walk to them. If you start on one side, you can visit two charity stores, a library, a rare book store and a special shop. The streets are crowded in the city center. Cars and people are everywhere in the morning. But inside the stores, it is quiet. It is a good place to spend an afternoon. Many people come to the city every year. It is a city that is growing. One of the big companies that sells things online and delivers them is based here. The city is still getting better. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is busy with their own goals. Nobody usually asks for help. You can be alone if you want. People will leave you alone. This is different from the South, where people care about each other. Here, you do not ask personal questions. You can keep to yourself if you want to. The city is lively. There are musicians living next door and singers upstairs. There is always something happening. We do not feel like strangers in our apartment building. We are like friends. We help each other when we need it. We celebrate birthdays and help each other when we are sad. I like my neighbors. They are kind to me. I try to be kind to them too. I clean after myself and leave food for them. They do the same. We bring mail to each other. It's nice to see them. I think they like my company as much as I like theirs. I live in a big building. It is not very human. But my neighbors make me feel like I am not alone.",
            "I live in a common type of neighborhood. It is like many others. My neighborhood is in a suburban area. You can see this when you look at the houses. They are all the same. The homeowner's association makes sure they are kept in good condition. The front yards are similar. There is a small patch of grass, some small stones, and a short driveway. The houses are usually one story, but some are two stories.\n\nThe roads in our neighborhood are very good. They are new and smooth. You do not see many potholes. The neighborhood has many things that make it nice to live here. We have community pools that anyone can use. There are walking trails where you can walk your dog or take a walk by yourself. We have a lot of space, so you can walk around the neighborhood to get exercise.\n\nMost people in the neighborhood are old. But we also have some middle-aged and young people. The neighborhood is safe. Everyone looks out for each other. We have many things that people need, like a mall. It is not very big, but it works. We have many stores, including ones that sell healthy food and ones that have cheap things.\n\nIt takes 15 minutes to drive to the city. But when you get there, you can find many stores. We have many nice things in our neighborhood. The neighborhood is safe and well-maintained. We have pools and walking trails. But we do not have stores right next door. You can just drive to the city and find what you need.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest. It is near a big city. My neighborhood is on the east side of the town. It is not the best area. Many houses are rented or owned by people who do not have a lot of money. But it is not a bad place. My neighbors are friendly. They say hello when I walk down the street.\n\nCrime is a little higher in my neighborhood. There have been some bad crimes in the past. Some people have been shot and killed. But we are lucky. We have not been hurt. Sometimes, things go missing from our porch if we leave them outside.\n\nThe town I live in is affected by a big problem called the opioid epidemic. Many people have died from a strong drug called fentanyl. But we have help. There are places where people can go to get better. They can learn to stop using the drug.\n\nMy son goes to a good school. The teachers and staff are kind. He has friends and likes to go to school. The school gives free breakfast and lunch to all students. No one goes hungry. The town is trying to make our neighborhood look better. They have fixed roads and parks. But they have not done much on our side of town.\n\nI like living here. People are friendly, the schools are good, and there are stores to buy things we need. Our home is not expensive, but it is comfortable. I have lived here for 16 years. I do not want to move.",
            "My neighborhood is special. It is on a hill. Many old buildings are there. They have history. I live in a 7-story apartment building near an old theater. A bar is a block away. People go there on warm summer nights. Many people want to go in, so there is a long line. A park is a few blocks away. It is big. People walk around the park on a concrete path. There are stairs in the wall. In the winter, homeless people put up tents. They are close together. They keep warm. They are close to a center where people can bathe and shower.\n\nI like my city. I like the people. Many years ago, this was a bad place. There was much violence. The government and police came to clean the streets. The people remember. They still tell stories about it. The people work hard to keep the neighborhood clean. They care about what happens in their city.\n\nSome people say you should not walk in my neighborhood at night if you are white. I think this is not true. I am light-skinned, but I feel like I am one of them. I know the neighborhood is rough. But I feel safe there. People are kind. A laundromat owner helped me when I was in trouble. Someone gave me money when I was cold and grey. They said I was beautiful.\n\nThis is my home. I feel alive when I walk in the neighborhood at night. I meet people who are kind. They are my friends.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan, in the United States. This is a place where farmland and small tourist cities are common. You will not find big city malls or big stores like Walmart or Target. If you want to go somewhere, you must use a car. But my town is one of the most beautiful places in the world. We have a lot of water around us. Beautiful Lake Michigan is on one side, and Lake Charlevoix is on the other. You can find a beach to swim in almost everywhere you go.\n\nMy neighborhood is like a small town. Houses are not close together. They are not the same. Some houses are old and some are new. Many houses have basements. You can see the basements from the road. Most houses have aluminum siding. You can see many different colors in the houses around my home. Every house has a yard. Some yards have trampolines and playsets for kids. Some people have gardens and fences for their animals.\n\nThe people who live here are hard workers. They work to make a living and raise their families. On any day, you will see kids playing outside and people walking their dogs or riding bicycles. Neighbors know each other and can tell who belongs and who does not. Everyone is friendly and says hello to each other. The lawns are well cared for. Leaves are not piled up on the lawns. The grass is cut and kept under control. People take care of their plants and bushes.\n\nThis is not a beautiful neighborhood that you think is very nice when you see it. But it is a good place to live. It is quiet and peaceful and safe. You can walk to the police station and the health department. The city's recycling center is nearby. We also have baseball and softball fields where you can hear the announcers calling the game. Our small airport is near the fields. You can hear the small planes flying and landing. You can walk to get ice cream or go downtown from my neighborhood. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, which is only a few blocks away. This is a great place to live."
